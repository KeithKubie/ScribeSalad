00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.818
So, we're going to finish now
by just talking more about this

00:00:05.818 --> 00:00:11.345
amazing immune system we have,
the adaptive immune system.

00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:16.096
As I said on Friday,
this is really an astonishing

00:00:16.096 --> 00:00:21.527
recognition system that just
plays a key role in us being

00:00:21.527 --> 00:00:26.666
able to survive in this world
that's full of bacteria,

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.866
and yeast, and fungi,
and viruses,

00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.000
parasites.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.989
There are things just all the
time trying to do us in,

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.655
and the reason we don't succumb
is because we have this amazing

00:00:40.655 --> 00:00:41.709
immune system.

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:46.301
And there are several features
about it which I summarized the

00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:47.053
other day.

00:00:47.053 --> 00:00:48.634
One is its diversity.

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:52.548
It has this incredible ability
to recognize entities,

00:00:52.548 --> 00:00:56.612
including things that are
synthesized in a lab that had

00:00:56.612 --> 00:01:00.000
never been seen on Earth before.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.647
It's amazing in terms of that
side of it.

00:01:03.647 --> 00:01:08.024
Coupled with this is this
incredible specificity.

00:01:08.024 --> 00:01:11.762
As I indicated the other day,
for example,

00:01:11.762 --> 00:01:16.413
if it was seeing a benzene ring
with a methyl on it,

00:01:16.413 --> 00:01:21.519
it might be able to recognize
this, but it could tell the

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:25.440
difference from having the
methyl over here.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.000
It's got that level of
sophistication.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.763
In spite of that,
in spite of the fact that it

00:01:32.763 --> 00:01:36.017
can recognize everything else,
it's able to avoid self

00:01:36.017 --> 00:01:45.000
recognition,
00:01:37&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.311
which is a bit of a trick if
you think about it,

00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:49.868
that you have a system that's
able to see essentially

00:01:49.868 --> 00:01:52.426
anything, including things that
never existed before.

00:01:52.426 --> 00:01:54.836
And how does it avoid seeing
all of our molecules,

00:01:54.836 --> 00:01:57.098
and all the many,
many things that makes us up?

00:01:57.098 --> 00:02:00.000
So, it has to be able to tell
self from non-self.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.264
And then, I also talked about
this memory aspects of the

00:02:04.264 --> 00:02:07.520
immune system,
that if you get exposed to a

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.250
virus or bacterium or something,
but the first immune response

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.723
is relatively weak.

00:02:13.723 --> 00:02:16.825
But then if you get
subsequently exposed,

00:02:16.825 --> 00:02:19.306
you get a very powerful
response.

00:02:19.306 --> 00:02:22.174
And that's the principle of a
vaccine.

00:02:22.174 --> 00:02:26.827
If you think someone is going
to be exposed to chickenpox but

00:02:26.827 --> 00:02:30.781
they haven't had it,
if you could somehow elicit the

00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:35.278
initial response without making
them sick by using a killed

00:02:35.278 --> 00:02:40.856
virus or something like that;
polio is one of the examples

00:02:40.856 --> 00:02:43.971
you hear about in the paper
right at the moment.

00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:47.948
Then, if someone does encounter
that virus or that bacterium,

00:02:47.948 --> 00:02:51.926
because that's second response,
it's very quick and it's very

00:02:51.926 --> 00:02:55.107
powerful, and that's what
vaccines are all about.

00:02:55.107 --> 00:02:58.090
So, the issue,
I guess, today is how does that

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.554
happen?

00:02:58.554 --> 00:03:02.068
And this is one of these
amazing insights into biology

00:03:02.068 --> 00:03:05.250
that's come by an application of
all these tools,

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.304
recombinant DNA,
and sequencing,

00:03:07.304 --> 00:03:11.017
and all the fancy sort of
things we've been talking about

00:03:11.017 --> 00:03:14.000
in the past few lectures.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.205
So, the first part I need to
let you know,

00:03:18.205 --> 00:03:22.923
is there are two parts to this
immune response,

00:03:22.923 --> 00:03:38.000
or two kinds of responses.
00:03:26&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.556
One's called the humoral
response and one's called the

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:45.443
cellular response.

00:03:45.443 --> 00:03:50.475
And this takes place in the
plasma of your blood.

00:03:50.475 --> 00:03:56.661
So, in the liquid part of the
blood if you spin down the red

00:03:56.661 --> 00:04:02.322
cells and the white cells,
what you're left with is the

00:04:02.322 --> 00:04:04.000
plasma.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.736
And, what this humoral response
response does,

00:04:08.736 --> 00:04:27.000
it's able to target bacteria,
viruses, proteins.
00:04:14&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.494
And the recognition is done by
a special kind of protein called

00:04:34.494 --> 00:04:35.824
antibodies.

00:04:35.824 --> 00:04:43.318
And I'll tell you about that in
just a moment because they're a

00:04:43.318 --> 00:04:48.758
very important class of protein
in this Earth.

00:04:48.758 --> 00:04:54.923
And the cellular immune
response is carried out by a

00:04:54.923 --> 00:05:13.000
special kind of white blood
cell.
00:05:00&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.279
For this lecture I think I'll
just abbreviate those as WBC if

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:19.160
I need it.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.000
What this targets is not the
actual pathogen itself.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.753
But it targets cells that are
infected with a virus or a

00:05:28.753 --> 00:05:32.641
bacterium, etc.
and that might seem to be even

00:05:32.641 --> 00:05:35.148
a little bit more of a trick.

00:05:35.148 --> 00:05:40.333
It's hard enough probably to
figure out how to take something

00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:45.172
that's an entity like a virus
that's floating around your

00:05:45.172 --> 00:05:50.271
blood and figure out how to find
something that binds to it.

00:05:50.271 --> 00:05:55.456
What do you do if the thing's
gone into one of your own cells

00:05:55.456 --> 00:06:00.209
and it's hiding out in their
replicating in the same way

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:04.185
that, let's say,
a phage does or something like

00:06:04.185 --> 00:06:09.197
that
How do you see one of your own

00:06:09.197 --> 00:06:14.421
cells that's been infected by
something like that?

00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:20.710
And there is a special type of
cells called cytotoxic T cell

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.055
that's very important.

00:06:23.055 --> 00:06:27.000
It's often abbreviated as that.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.716
So let me first say a word
about antibodies.

00:06:31.716 --> 00:06:38.077
These are proteins that consist
of four polypeptide chains.

00:06:38.077 --> 00:06:41.258
Two of the chains are bigger.

00:06:41.258 --> 00:06:44.658
So they're called heavy chains.

00:06:44.658 --> 00:06:46.961
There's two of those.

00:06:46.961 --> 00:06:52.883
And there are two chains that
are smaller, so those are

00:06:52.883 --> 00:06:55.954
usually called light chains.

00:06:55.954 --> 00:07:01.000
So, there's four of them
altogether.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.225
And, ignoring secondary
structure and stuff for the

00:07:04.225 --> 00:07:08.096
moment, let me just sort of give
you an idea of how these are

00:07:08.096 --> 00:07:08.677
laid out.

00:07:08.677 --> 00:07:23.000
These are the two heavy chains.
00:07:11&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.838
And these are joined together
by disulfide bridges.

00:07:27.838 --> 00:07:30.838
You remember disulfide bridges?

00:07:30.838 --> 00:07:36.645
If you had two cystines they
can form a covalent bond between

00:07:36.645 --> 00:07:39.741
them under oxidizing conditions.

00:07:39.741 --> 00:07:43.806
So, those heavy chains are
locked together.

00:07:43.806 --> 00:07:48.161
They're actually physically
covalently joined.

00:07:48.161 --> 00:07:51.838
In fact, there's the light
chains here.

00:07:51.838 --> 00:07:53.967
So, this is the light.

00:07:53.967 --> 00:07:59.483
And this part up here is highly
variable between different

00:07:59.483 --> 00:08:02.000
antibodies.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.863
And the part down here is
constant between antibodies.

00:08:06.863 --> 00:08:11.727
And it's this huge amount of
variability that the body

00:08:11.727 --> 00:08:15.857
produces many,
many, many types of antibodies,

00:08:15.857 --> 00:08:21.639
and then figures out which ones
will work to find the particular

00:08:21.639 --> 00:08:24.575
entity it's trying to recognize.

00:08:24.575 --> 00:08:31.000
And I'll come back and tell you
in a moment how that is done.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.439
There is a diagram of what I
showed you, but of course these

00:08:36.439 --> 00:08:37.638
are proteins.

00:08:37.638 --> 00:08:42.893
They have three-dimensional
structures, and so if you were

00:08:42.893 --> 00:08:47.687
to look at them with the
secondary structure showing,

00:08:47.687 --> 00:08:51.560
you can see the different,
especially here,

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:57.000
a lot of beta sheets should be
leaping out at you.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.773
Now, the part where the
recognition is done is up at

00:09:00.773 --> 00:09:01.439
this end.

00:09:01.439 --> 00:09:03.733
So, it's essentially right
here.

00:09:03.733 --> 00:09:05.656
And here's a little movie.

00:09:05.656 --> 00:09:09.578
You could see how the thing
looks in three dimensional

00:09:09.578 --> 00:09:10.022
space.

00:09:10.022 --> 00:09:14.017
You see the part that's over on
the left at the moment;

00:09:14.017 --> 00:09:18.457
that's the light chain and the
blue chain is that part of the

00:09:18.457 --> 00:09:21.417
heavy chain complex with the
light chain.

00:09:21.417 --> 00:09:24.894
And here is the,
it's been tilted up this way so

00:09:24.894 --> 00:09:30.000
this is the yellow and blue part
you were looking at

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.933
And the recognition pocket is
right at the end of that.

00:09:33.933 --> 00:09:37.503
And at this picture,
it's showing how a particular

00:09:37.503 --> 00:09:39.324
protein was shown in red.

00:09:39.324 --> 00:09:43.622
This is an anti-body that can
very, very precisely recognize

00:09:43.622 --> 00:09:45.370
that particular protein.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:49.450
You can't really tell it from
the three-dimensional shape

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:53.238
shown on the left because it
just shows the secondary

00:09:53.238 --> 00:09:53.966
structure.

00:09:53.966 --> 00:09:57.609
But, if you could see the full
space filling model,

00:09:57.609 --> 00:09:58.774
you'd be amazed.

00:09:58.774 --> 00:10:03.000
The surfaces are absolutely
complementary.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.516
It goes back to one of those
principles I've said over and

00:10:08.516 --> 00:10:14.129
over and over again that so much
of biology works by having

00:10:14.129 --> 00:10:16.354
complementary surfaces.

00:10:16.354 --> 00:10:21.870
And there's a little movie you
could see how this thing is

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.580
setting up there at the top.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:29.709
So, these antibodies are
produced by a special type of

00:10:29.709 --> 00:10:33.000
what are called B cells.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:44.905
These are cells that play roles
in the humoral part of the

00:10:44.905 --> 00:10:47.829
immune system.

00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:54.303
And they're called plasma
cells.

00:10:54.303 --> 00:11:06.000
And each plasma cell makes one
particular antibody.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:06.988
And that's it.

00:11:06.988 --> 00:11:10.378
So you have many different
types of plasma cells,

00:11:10.378 --> 00:11:14.826
but each one only expresses one
particular gene that encodes one

00:11:14.826 --> 00:11:16.239
particular antibody.

00:11:16.239 --> 00:11:19.275
So, for years,
this is something that people

00:11:19.275 --> 00:11:21.535
struggled with just
conceptually.

00:11:21.535 --> 00:11:25.136
They could sort of calculate
that there were so many

00:11:25.136 --> 00:11:29.444
antibodies that if your entire
genome was nothing but antibody

00:11:29.444 --> 00:11:33.539
genes, we still wouldn't have
enough DNA to account for all

00:11:33.539 --> 00:11:37.000
this ability to recognize
things.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.774
So, some other principle had to
be involved.

00:11:40.774 --> 00:11:45.778
And there are all sorts of
speculations about what it was.

00:11:45.778 --> 00:11:49.465
I had shown you,
I'd managed to not get Bob

00:11:49.465 --> 00:11:52.801
Horvitz's thing on here,
but this then,

00:11:52.801 --> 00:11:57.190
who is our fourth Nobel
laureate, I've been sort of

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:00.000
working through these.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.728
Susumu Tonegawa,
who is in the cancer center,

00:12:03.728 --> 00:12:06.355
he's in the biology department.

00:12:06.355 --> 00:12:10.169
He's also heading,
now, this Picower Center of

00:12:10.169 --> 00:12:11.864
learning and memory.

00:12:11.864 --> 00:12:16.949
So, since doing this work I'm
telling you about on the immune

00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:21.949
system, he's gone to do some
wonderful stuff more on the big

00:12:21.949 --> 00:12:25.847
problem of how we learn,
and trying to get more

00:12:25.847 --> 00:12:30.000
molecular insights into that
process.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.927
But what Susumu managed to
figure out was that this

00:12:34.927 --> 00:12:39.657
variation and diversity in the
immune system was,

00:12:39.657 --> 00:12:43.205
at its roots,
a combinatorial sort of

00:12:43.205 --> 00:12:43.994
process.

00:12:43.994 --> 00:12:50.202
So, if you look in the DNA of a
zygote, so that's the fertilized

00:12:50.202 --> 00:12:50.597
egg.

00:12:50.597 --> 00:12:55.327
We're just getting started with
one of our cells.

00:12:55.327 --> 00:12:57.791
You've got a single cell.

00:12:57.791 --> 00:13:04.000
We're looking in the DNA to see
what would happen.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.414
We come to the part of the DNA
that's involved in producing

00:13:08.414 --> 00:13:09.251
antibodies.

00:13:09.251 --> 00:13:13.057
What he found was that if you
looked along the DNA,

00:13:13.057 --> 00:13:17.167
there were sequences that
looked like part of the stuff

00:13:17.167 --> 00:13:21.658
that you'd find in antibodies,
but there were a whole series

00:13:21.658 --> 00:13:22.267
of them.

00:13:22.267 --> 00:13:25.616
So, he called this particular
segment V1, V2,

00:13:25.616 --> 00:13:26.606
V3, up to VN.

00:13:26.606 --> 00:13:31.249
There were a whole set of these
basically side by side by side

00:13:31.249 --> 00:13:33.000
by side.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.484
There are about 300 of these in
humans.

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:46.711
And then down the DNA a little
bit he found another set of

00:13:46.711 --> 00:13:53.494
sequences that are all
variations of each other.

00:13:53.494 --> 00:14:01.000
And these were given D1,
D2, D3, D4, up to DN.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.006
And there are many of these.

00:14:04.006 --> 00:14:10.557
And then down the DNA a little
farther, there were three other

00:14:10.557 --> 00:14:15.067
sections that were called
joining segments.

00:14:15.067 --> 00:14:17.966
They were called J1,
J2, J3.

00:14:17.966 --> 00:14:24.409
And a little bit farther down
there was a block of DNA coding

00:14:24.409 --> 00:14:30.530
the constant part of this
polypeptide chain that goes into

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:33.000
an antibody.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.943
And what Susumu Tonegawa was
able to show,

00:14:35.943 --> 00:14:38.168
and this led to the Nobel
Prize.

00:14:38.168 --> 00:14:42.331
So, what happens during the
development of these B cells is

00:14:42.331 --> 00:14:44.126
there are rearrangements.

00:14:44.126 --> 00:14:46.495
And a lot of DNA is thrown
around.

00:14:46.495 --> 00:14:50.801
And the basic strategy is to
take, if you think this as being

00:14:50.801 --> 00:14:54.750
column A, you take one from
column A, one from column B,

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:58.698
just picking them randomly,
one from column C over here,

00:14:58.698 --> 00:15:02.000
and throw away everything else.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.975
So you might have,
for example,

00:15:06.975 --> 00:15:12.448
in one B cell,
you might have V32,

00:15:12.448 --> 00:15:18.585
D15, J2, and then the constant
region.

00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:28.370
And, what's in between is an
intron that will be spliced out

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:36.000
at the time that the gene's
expressed.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:50.957
In another B cell,
you might have V11,

00:15:50.957 --> 00:15:55.000
D22, J3.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.337
So, this rearrangement is
random in the sense of which V

00:16:01.337 --> 00:16:06.407
segment is chosen,
which D segment is chosen,

00:16:06.407 --> 00:16:08.711
and which J segment.

00:16:08.711 --> 00:16:15.510
I don't mean that it all just
joins together in a completely

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.469
uncontrolled way.

00:16:17.469 --> 00:16:34.000
And then the rest of the DNA is
deleted.
00:16:23&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:46.820
So a consequence of this,
is each B cell expresses only

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.906
one antibody.

00:16:49.906 --> 00:17:03.438
It's true that they're diploid,
but only one chromosome is

00:17:03.438 --> 00:17:07.000
expressed.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:14.588
So that's how they avoid,
you can imagine they might make

00:17:14.588 --> 00:17:15.537
to two.

00:17:15.537 --> 00:17:18.654
But they only make one.

00:17:18.654 --> 00:17:22.719
In the process,
as you can see,

00:17:22.719 --> 00:17:25.429
that part is random.

00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:30.985
Furthermore,
the joining events are what I

00:17:30.985 --> 00:17:36.000
think you could call sloppy.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.883
And this leads to even more
variation than you would have

00:17:41.883 --> 00:17:47.031
imagined simply looking at the
number of segments.

00:17:47.031 --> 00:17:52.914
So, what this part of the
process does is it explains why

00:17:52.914 --> 00:17:57.326
the system can be has the
diversity it has,

00:17:57.326 --> 00:18:03.000
because it's using this
combinatorial process.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.554
If you know the number you can
calculate how many possible

00:18:06.554 --> 00:18:07.988
combinations there are.

00:18:07.988 --> 00:18:11.542
But then there's much more
variation because when it joins

00:18:11.542 --> 00:18:15.408
together a little segments that
are joined are done in a sloppy

00:18:15.408 --> 00:18:19.025
way so that the DNA sequence
that shows up where the joints

00:18:19.025 --> 00:18:22.704
occur doesn't look like anything
that was in the DNA at all.

00:18:22.704 --> 00:18:25.822
It was something like a
polymerase that wasn't very

00:18:25.822 --> 00:18:30.000
faithful copying and making
mistakes as it went along.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.971
So what the system does,
is it doesn't get you a

00:18:32.971 --> 00:18:33.540
response.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:36.511
It just explains why there is
so much diversity,

00:18:36.511 --> 00:18:40.051
and why it is that I can go
into the lab and synthesize a

00:18:40.051 --> 00:18:43.022
compound that's never been on
this earth before,

00:18:43.022 --> 00:18:46.183
inject a rabbit to it,
and the rabbit will probably

00:18:46.183 --> 00:18:49.281
produce an antibody that's able
to recognize that.

00:18:49.281 --> 00:18:52.252
That's because it's made this
whole set of them.

00:18:52.252 --> 00:18:55.919
And they all are going to have
somewhat different surfaces.

00:18:55.919 --> 00:18:59.649
And they make so many that one
of those surfaces is going to

00:18:59.649 --> 00:19:03.000
fit the molecule that I'm
testing.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.661
You can sort of see,
that's only part of the trick.

00:19:06.661 --> 00:19:09.664
So, how do you now get an
immune response?

00:19:09.664 --> 00:19:12.814
Because you've got millions of
these things.

00:19:12.814 --> 00:19:16.695
But what you now need is a
whole lot of one particular

00:19:16.695 --> 00:19:20.723
antibody that's going to
recognize the pathogen that you

00:19:20.723 --> 00:19:22.261
are being exposed to.

00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:25.191
And the principle of that is
really cute.

00:19:25.191 --> 00:19:41.000
It's a process called clonal
selection.
00:19:29&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:19:41.000 --> 00:20:01.000
And the idea is that each B
cell displays
00:19:48&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.164
a sample of its antibody on its
surface.

00:20:04.164 --> 00:20:08.790
So, we might think of it this
sort of way, that after this

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:11.793
process is through we have one B
cell.

00:20:11.793 --> 00:20:15.201
Of course, these are way out of
proportion.

00:20:15.201 --> 00:20:19.502
The cells would be huge,
and these would be molecules.

00:20:19.502 --> 00:20:20.963
So, they're small.

00:20:20.963 --> 00:20:25.507
But here would be an antibody
that can recognize squares,

00:20:25.507 --> 00:20:30.052
say, this one would have an
antibody that could recognize

00:20:30.052 --> 00:20:32.000
triangle.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.555
This one would have an antibody
that could recognize a

00:20:35.555 --> 00:20:38.574
semicircle and so on,
millions and millions of

00:20:38.574 --> 00:20:39.714
different shapes.

00:20:39.714 --> 00:20:42.129
And these cells don't divide,
though.

00:20:42.129 --> 00:20:44.947
They've been made,
and they just sit there.

00:20:44.947 --> 00:20:48.234
And then, when you stimulate
them with an antigen,

00:20:48.234 --> 00:20:52.394
and I used that word the other
day, an antigen is just anything

00:20:52.394 --> 00:20:54.742
that will elicit an immune
response.

00:20:54.742 --> 00:20:57.425
It could be a piece of a
foreign protein,

00:20:57.425 --> 00:21:00.176
carbohydrate,
just about anything that's a

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:04.000
small molecule you've made in
the lab.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:14.982
But let's say we exposed now
this individual to an antigen,

00:21:14.982 --> 00:21:23.502
which in this case can fit into
that receptor.

00:21:23.502 --> 00:21:30.887
And what happens,
then, this one becomes

00:21:30.887 --> 00:21:36.000
stimulated to divide.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:45.333
So what we have now is this B
cell that has this antigen stuck

00:21:45.333 --> 00:21:53.442
into its binding pocket on the
sample of its antibody.

00:21:53.442 --> 00:22:01.245
And then, the cells divide and
they give rise to two

00:22:01.245 --> 00:22:04.000
populations.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:11.911
They give rise to the plasma
cells, which are very

00:22:11.911 --> 00:22:18.208
short-lived, on the order of a
few days.

00:22:18.208 --> 00:22:25.796
And what these do,
so they would look like this,

00:22:25.796 --> 00:22:35.000
what they do is secrete
antibodies into the plasma.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.272
So what you end up with,
then, are a lot of these

00:22:39.272 --> 00:22:44.703
antibodies that have exactly the
specificity that the original

00:22:44.703 --> 00:22:49.243
sample had on the outside of
that particular B cell.

00:22:49.243 --> 00:22:51.201
This takes a few days.

00:22:51.201 --> 00:22:56.097
So back when we were talking
about the discovery of DNA,

00:22:56.097 --> 00:23:00.281
I was telling you about
Streptococcus pneumonia,

00:23:00.281 --> 00:23:05.000
and you get infected by the
Streptococcus.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.026
And there would be this period
of five or six days where this

00:23:09.026 --> 00:23:12.449
person was very sick,
and then either they'd survive

00:23:12.449 --> 00:23:13.993
or they didn't survive.

00:23:13.993 --> 00:23:17.013
If they survived,
they'd been able to mount an

00:23:17.013 --> 00:23:20.771
immune response and make these
antibodies before they got

00:23:20.771 --> 00:23:22.315
killed by the bacteria.

00:23:22.315 --> 00:23:26.409
And the reason it takes a few
days is when you start out there

00:23:26.409 --> 00:23:29.966
could be just one B cell that's
able with an antibody,

00:23:29.966 --> 00:23:33.389
makes an antibody that is
capable of recognizing the

00:23:33.389 --> 00:23:35.000
capsule.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.448
Maybe there are a few.

00:23:36.448 --> 00:23:39.344
Anyway, but they were very,
very tiny number,

00:23:39.344 --> 00:23:42.043
and there were probably a lot
of bacteria.

00:23:42.043 --> 00:23:45.531
So what had to happen,
then, is that the original cell

00:23:45.531 --> 00:23:48.691
or small number of cells that
could recognize the

00:23:48.691 --> 00:23:50.863
Streptococcus had to be
amplified.

00:23:50.863 --> 00:23:54.220
They had to make a lot of
plasma cells that have the

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:58.103
potential to make the antibody,
and then they had to secrete

00:23:58.103 --> 00:24:01.000
the antibody into the plasma.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.923
And I'll tell you in just a
minute some of the strategies

00:24:05.923 --> 00:24:09.439
that that uses to help kill the
pathogen.

00:24:09.439 --> 00:24:13.923
And the other population,
just before I go on there,

00:24:13.923 --> 00:24:16.736
are what are called memory
cells.

00:24:16.736 --> 00:24:21.131
There's not as many of these
made, but they're very

00:24:21.131 --> 00:24:22.098
long-lived.

00:24:22.098 --> 00:24:26.758
And so, what they have is
exactly the same capacity to

00:24:26.758 --> 00:24:30.890
make the same antibody,
but they're not actively

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:33.000
dividing.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.234
They'll just sit there,
float around in your

00:24:39.234 --> 00:24:47.353
bloodstream, and then if you get
a second exposure to the

00:24:47.353 --> 00:24:55.907
antigen, you get a very fast and
strong response because the

00:24:55.907 --> 00:25:04.460
selection for finding the cells
that had antibodies that can

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:12.000
recognize the antigen has
already been done.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.624
And there's already a few of
them around, and then after you

00:25:15.624 --> 00:25:18.327
do that then you're able to
make, once again,

00:25:18.327 --> 00:25:21.767
the binding of the antigen
stimulates these guys to start

00:25:21.767 --> 00:25:22.320
dividing.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.225
They make a lot of plasma
cells.

00:25:24.225 --> 00:25:27.051
And going back to the principal
of vaccination,

00:25:27.051 --> 00:25:30.000
your first response is fairly
modest.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.070
But if you get a second
response, what you're doing now

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:36.860
is the memory cells are already
there.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:41.006
They have the specificity for
recognizing the antigen in

00:25:41.006 --> 00:25:41.685
question.

00:25:41.685 --> 00:25:44.399
And you can make a whole lot of
them.

00:25:44.399 --> 00:25:47.866
So, if you had chickenpox when
you were little,

00:25:47.866 --> 00:25:52.541
you have memory cells that know
how to recognize the chickenpox

00:25:52.541 --> 00:25:52.993
virus.

00:25:52.993 --> 00:25:56.913
And then when your kid gets
chickenpox like mine did,

00:25:56.913 --> 00:26:01.512
I didn't get sick because I had
memory cells that were able to

00:26:01.512 --> 00:26:04.000
recognize that.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.718
OK, so what happens if you get
an antibody?

00:26:09.718 --> 00:26:17.070
How does this help the
organism, or in our case someone

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:21.699
like you or me,
avoid getting sick?

00:26:21.699 --> 00:26:26.464
So there are a couple of
strategies.

00:26:26.464 --> 00:26:33.000
One we might think of is bind
and block.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.596
For example,
you are a virus and you get

00:26:36.596 --> 00:26:38.625
covered by antibodies.

00:26:38.625 --> 00:26:43.512
Viruses: it's exactly the same
logic as bacteriophage,

00:26:43.512 --> 00:26:48.123
except that instead of
affecting a bacterial cell a

00:26:48.123 --> 00:26:51.904
virus would be infecting one of
our cells.

00:26:51.904 --> 00:26:55.870
And as the virus has receptors
or something,

00:26:55.870 --> 00:27:01.311
it has to recognize something
on my cell, in order to attach

00:27:01.311 --> 00:27:05.000
and then to inject its DNA.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.609
So if we've got an antibody
sitting here,

00:27:09.609 --> 00:27:14.563
then it can't find its way to
the host cell.

00:27:14.563 --> 00:27:19.403
And then, there are a couple of
other ways.

00:27:19.403 --> 00:27:22.975
They can target for
destruction.

00:27:22.975 --> 00:27:26.547
And there's basically two ways.

00:27:26.547 --> 00:27:33.000
There's something called the
complement system,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.741
that if it is able to
recognize, say,

00:27:37.741 --> 00:27:45.380
the bacterial cell and their
antibodies are sticking to the

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:53.282
outside, what the complement
system does is it's able to make

00:27:53.282 --> 00:28:00.000
little pores in the membrane of
the pathogen.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.509
And I think one of the things I
hope you will remember is that

00:28:03.509 --> 00:28:06.617
one of the secrets of life is
that we have to keep that

00:28:06.617 --> 00:28:07.882
membrane around there.

00:28:07.882 --> 00:28:11.162
We have to keep all of our
insides in, and the rest of the

00:28:11.162 --> 00:28:11.968
world outside.

00:28:11.968 --> 00:28:14.845
We have hydrogen ion gradients
across the membrane.

00:28:14.845 --> 00:28:17.319
So, if you want to kill a cell
and you, say,

00:28:17.319 --> 00:28:19.966
insert a protein that has a
little hole and it,

00:28:19.966 --> 00:28:22.613
and that thing sits and sticks
in the membrane,

00:28:22.613 --> 00:28:23.648
that cell is dead.

00:28:23.648 --> 00:28:26.698
It can't maintain an ion
gradient, and things can leak

00:28:26.698 --> 00:28:29.000
out through the hole.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.333
So that's one of the ways of
killing it.

00:28:33.333 --> 00:28:36.777
The other ways are macrophages.

00:28:36.777 --> 00:28:41.777
These are a type of white blood
cell, as well,

00:28:41.777 --> 00:28:48.111
are very good at recognizing
bacteria that have antibodies

00:28:48.111 --> 00:28:50.444
stuck to the outside.

00:28:50.444 --> 00:28:55.222
And in fact,
that was the principle of that.

00:28:55.222 --> 00:29:02.000
We have the Streptococcus,
and we have the capsule.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.546
And you may remember that
little movie I showed of a white

00:29:05.546 --> 00:29:09.342
blood cell that was trying to
eat it, and it couldn't get hold

00:29:09.342 --> 00:29:12.017
of the thing,
whereas we saw another example

00:29:12.017 --> 00:29:15.315
where a bacterium without a
capsule, there was sort of

00:29:15.315 --> 00:29:18.799
principle I said is that the
white blood cell was able to

00:29:18.799 --> 00:29:22.595
recognize the bacterium and then
it pinches it off inside of a

00:29:22.595 --> 00:29:23.591
membrane bubble.

00:29:23.591 --> 00:29:27.386
And I sort of said at least in
principle that there is another

00:29:27.386 --> 00:29:32.197
little bubble with poisons,
and it brings it together so

00:29:32.197 --> 00:29:36.905
that you have the bacterium and
the poison together inside of

00:29:36.905 --> 00:29:41.770
some intracellular compartment,
so that macrophages know how to

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:44.909
kill a bacterium if they bring
it inside.

00:29:44.909 --> 00:29:49.460
The problem in the case of
something like Streptococcus was

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:53.933
being able to recognize it
because it couldn't get hold of

00:29:53.933 --> 00:29:54.953
that capsule.

00:29:54.953 --> 00:29:59.661
So, those antibodies that guy
made during that five day thing

00:29:59.661 --> 00:30:03.428
decorate the outside of the
capsule because their

00:30:03.428 --> 00:30:09.000
specificity is to recognize the
capsule and bind to it.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.811
But a macrophage,
even if it couldn't get hold of

00:30:12.811 --> 00:30:17.576
the bacterium with a capsule is
able to ingest something that

00:30:17.576 --> 00:30:20.355
has antibodies stuck on the
outside.

00:30:20.355 --> 00:30:24.326
And once it gets inside,
it can kill the bacterium.

00:30:24.326 --> 00:30:28.535
In fact, immunologists call
this process opsinization,

00:30:28.535 --> 00:30:32.585
which is derived from the Greek
words for seasoning,

00:30:32.585 --> 00:30:36.000
like putting salt on your food.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.734
And the idea was that when they
were giving that word,

00:30:39.734 --> 00:30:43.328
with these macrophages,
which liked to eat bacteria,

00:30:43.328 --> 00:30:47.204
they have a little seasoning
that they have these little

00:30:47.204 --> 00:30:49.741
antibodies decorating their
outsides.

00:30:49.741 --> 00:30:53.899
So here you can see it least in
the humoral response how you

00:30:53.899 --> 00:30:57.000
generate a whole lot of
diversity.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.411
Then this principle of what's
called clonal selection

00:31:00.411 --> 00:31:04.282
identifies a B cell that's able
to make an antibody that can

00:31:04.282 --> 00:31:07.956
recognize the particular
pathogen or molecule that you're

00:31:07.956 --> 00:31:11.564
being exposed to amplify that,
make a lot of antibodies,

00:31:11.564 --> 00:31:15.172
and then it can either just
stick to the pathogen like a

00:31:15.172 --> 00:31:19.043
virus and mess it up that way,
or it can decorate it if it's

00:31:19.043 --> 00:31:22.652
something like a bacterium,
and then pull in a couple of

00:31:22.652 --> 00:31:26.194
other systems that are capable
of killing the pathogen.

00:31:26.194 --> 00:31:30.000
I mean, it's an absolutely
amazing system.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.412
It sounded like science fiction
when I first heard about it.

00:31:33.412 --> 00:31:36.593
When I heard people talking
about it, everyone could see

00:31:36.593 --> 00:31:38.848
there was an information theory
problem.

00:31:38.848 --> 00:31:41.856
How do you encode all that
information with just this

00:31:41.856 --> 00:31:43.244
amount of DNA in a cell?

00:31:43.244 --> 00:31:44.285
Now we understand.

00:31:44.285 --> 00:31:47.466
And there's even another part
that I'm leaving out here.

00:31:47.466 --> 00:31:49.953
But once this whole thing has
been selected,

00:31:49.953 --> 00:31:53.307
there's another whole round of
sort of refinement where the

00:31:53.307 --> 00:31:56.835
cells do kind of a very kind of
localized mutagenesis one base

00:31:56.835 --> 00:32:01.000
pair at a time in the vicinity
of this binding pocket.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.625
And they're able to make,
if they're given more time and

00:32:06.625 --> 00:32:12.250
more exposure to the antigen,
they can make a better and

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:18.488
better binding surface until you
begin to approach sort of the

00:32:18.488 --> 00:32:20.534
theoretical maximum.

00:32:20.534 --> 00:32:25.238
Now, the T cell,
in this case this involves the

00:32:25.238 --> 00:32:33.953
cytotoxic T cells,
and they have a specific

00:32:33.953 --> 00:32:43.131
recognition molecule on their
surface.

00:32:43.131 --> 00:32:50.821
It's called the T cell
receptor.

00:32:50.821 --> 00:33:00.000
And in this case,
it's attached.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.007
So, this is the membrane of the
T cell.

00:33:03.007 --> 00:33:06.411
And this is the cytoplasm down
on this side.

00:33:06.411 --> 00:33:10.765
There's a little bit of the
protein that goes into that.

00:33:10.765 --> 00:33:14.643
And then there's an alpha helix
that goes through,

00:33:14.643 --> 00:33:17.968
and then a segment that comes
up like this.

00:33:17.968 --> 00:33:21.926
And there's another chain that
does the same thing.

00:33:21.926 --> 00:33:25.804
So, there are two segments that
span the membrane.

00:33:25.804 --> 00:33:30.000
This thing is anchored in the
membrane.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.183
And then it's essentially the
same principle as with

00:33:34.183 --> 00:33:35.085
antibodies.

00:33:35.085 --> 00:33:39.679
There's a variable region,
and there's a constant region.

00:33:39.679 --> 00:33:44.355
And to a first approximation
anyway the logic by which the

00:33:44.355 --> 00:33:48.703
cell generates a huge,
diverse set of T cell receptors

00:33:48.703 --> 00:33:53.953
is the same logic that underlies
the generation of a whole lot of

00:33:53.953 --> 00:33:58.300
different antibodies by taking
segments, joining them,

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:02.156
picking them randomly out of
column A, column B,

00:34:02.156 --> 00:34:06.996
and then joining them together,
sloppy joining all the other

00:34:06.996 --> 00:34:12.000
processes to increase the pool
of diversity.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:20.800
Now, what these B cells are
able to do, then,

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:33.000
these T cells are able to do is
something quite remarkable.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.788
We have on our cells,
this is, say,

00:34:35.788 --> 00:34:39.397
one of my cells,
little sort of proteins that

00:34:39.397 --> 00:34:43.170
function as sort of display
cases or something.

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:48.091
And what they do is they show
samples of all of the different

00:34:48.091 --> 00:34:51.946
proteins that are inside us at
any given moment.

00:34:51.946 --> 00:34:55.227
Proteins are turned over,
and chopped up,

00:34:55.227 --> 00:34:59.000
and things are recycled and so
on.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:06.261
So there are always little
peptides, little pieces of

00:35:06.261 --> 00:35:08.495
proteins around.

00:35:08.495 --> 00:35:13.243
And, the display case,
if you will,

00:35:13.243 --> 00:35:19.108
has got a major
histocompatibility complex,

00:35:19.108 --> 00:35:26.788
which is usually abbreviated as
MHC because it's such an

00:35:26.788 --> 00:35:30.000
unwieldy name.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.417
And there are many,
many alleles of MHC in the

00:35:33.417 --> 00:35:37.974
population, which means that we
each have, for the most part,

00:35:37.974 --> 00:35:42.607
a sort of individually designed
display case for showing these

00:35:42.607 --> 00:35:43.291
peptides.

00:35:43.291 --> 00:35:47.620
The property of these display
cases, they take some little

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:51.113
piece of a protein just a few
amino acids long,

00:35:51.113 --> 00:35:55.746
it binds into the display case,
and that sticks on the outside

00:35:55.746 --> 00:35:56.658
of our cell.

00:35:56.658 --> 00:36:00.000
And so we have a lot of these.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.663
And so on the surface of our
cells are these little

00:36:03.663 --> 00:36:08.132
individualized MHC display cases
showing little samples of the

00:36:08.132 --> 00:36:12.601
peptides of the proteins from
the proteins that are inside us.

00:36:12.601 --> 00:36:16.778
So, if everything is fine,
all of the peptides that are in

00:36:16.778 --> 00:36:18.976
the display cases are our own.

00:36:18.976 --> 00:36:22.859
And I'll tell you in a minute
why that doesn't cause a

00:36:22.859 --> 00:36:23.445
problem.

00:36:23.445 --> 00:36:27.914
But then if you get infected by
a virus, and it injects DNA or

00:36:27.914 --> 00:36:31.578
its RNA inside of you and then
starts to replicate,

00:36:31.578 --> 00:36:35.388
now you have some virus
proteins that don't belong to

00:36:35.388 --> 00:36:37.000
you.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.970
They get chopped into pieces,
and they begin to appear on

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:47.661
these major histocompatibility
display cases.

00:36:47.661 --> 00:36:51.393
So if you think here,
this could be,

00:36:51.393 --> 00:36:57.150
perhaps, a little piece of,
let's call it self protein,

00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:02.801
it could be a little piece of
my own DNA polymerase or

00:37:02.801 --> 00:37:06.000
something like that.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.872
And over in this one,
let's say we have a little

00:37:12.872 --> 00:37:16.528
piece of a viral protein.

00:37:16.528 --> 00:37:24.132
So that's something that would
not be normally there.

00:37:24.132 --> 00:37:31.443
So what this T-cell receptor
does is it recognizes,

00:37:31.443 --> 00:37:37.000
so this is non-self or foreign.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:43.700
What the T-cell receptor does
is it recognizes these foreign

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:44.722
peptides.

00:37:44.722 --> 00:37:50.287
But it does it in the context
of the display case.

00:37:50.287 --> 00:37:55.624
Otherwise the peptides would be
floating around.

00:37:55.624 --> 00:37:59.599
So, in essence,
the T-cell receptor,

00:37:59.599 --> 00:38:06.413
if this is a cytotoxic T cell
it's able to see the individual

00:38:06.413 --> 00:38:13.000
display case with a bit of viral
protein in it.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.619
And then it knows that it
should kill that cell because

00:38:16.619 --> 00:38:19.836
it's got something in it that
shouldn't be there.

00:38:19.836 --> 00:38:23.120
I mean, it's a brutal but very
effective strategy.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:26.538
If we applied it here,
I go around if I found any of

00:38:26.538 --> 00:38:29.353
you had a cold,
I could just take a gun and

00:38:29.353 --> 00:38:33.442
shoot you and it would cut down
on the number of sick days for

00:38:33.442 --> 00:38:38.000
the rest of us because it
wouldn't spread the infection.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.486
But in essence,
at a molecular level,

00:38:40.486 --> 00:38:41.867
that's the strategy.

00:38:41.867 --> 00:38:45.804
Try to identify a cell that's
got something inside it that

00:38:45.804 --> 00:38:49.189
shouldn't be there,
and then the cytotoxic T cells

00:38:49.189 --> 00:38:49.879
kill that.

00:38:49.879 --> 00:38:53.816
And let me just show you a
couple of quick movies of this.

00:38:53.816 --> 00:38:56.855
At this point,
these will be the last protein

00:38:56.855 --> 00:39:01.000
structures you're going to see
from me, I think.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.460
Here's a representation of that
T cell just as a cartoon as you

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:06.971
see it in a textbook.

00:39:06.971 --> 00:39:07.762
Here it is.

00:39:07.762 --> 00:39:10.208
This is the binding pocket up
here.

00:39:10.208 --> 00:39:14.093
And there's a little tiny
peptide, nine and amino acids

00:39:14.093 --> 00:39:16.395
from the HIV virus bound in
here.

00:39:16.395 --> 00:39:20.208
Somebody did a crystal
structure, and was able to work

00:39:20.208 --> 00:39:20.856
that out.

00:39:20.856 --> 00:39:24.956
And, if you look at it in three
dimensions, you'll see how

00:39:24.956 --> 00:39:29.345
beautifully this little binding
pocket and the peptide lies in

00:39:29.345 --> 00:39:31.000
there.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.339
So that red part is the piece
of chalk, and the other part is

00:39:35.339 --> 00:39:37.581
what I'm describing as my hand.

00:39:37.581 --> 00:39:41.413
It's not a bad analogy,
actually, even on a structural

00:39:41.413 --> 00:39:41.847
level.

00:39:41.847 --> 00:39:44.668
And then, here's another
representation.

00:39:44.668 --> 00:39:48.862
This is sort of showing the
hand with a piece of peptide in

00:39:48.862 --> 00:39:49.079
it.

00:39:49.079 --> 00:39:52.912
And then the T cell is able to
see this whole thing in

00:39:52.912 --> 00:39:53.852
recognize it.

00:39:53.852 --> 00:39:56.962
And, if you look at it in a
structural form,

00:39:56.962 --> 00:40:00.000
here's the little peptide.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.738
This is the part,
the display case you're looking

00:40:03.738 --> 00:40:03.972
at.

00:40:03.972 --> 00:40:08.645
And here's the T cell receptor
now fitting down in seeing the

00:40:08.645 --> 00:40:12.851
peptide in the context of this
major histocompatibility

00:40:12.851 --> 00:40:13.474
antigen.

00:40:13.474 --> 00:40:17.992
And again, these things are all
beautifully complementary a

00:40:17.992 --> 00:40:19.861
three dimensional level.

00:40:19.861 --> 00:40:24.535
Again, at the heart of this is
the principle of complementary

00:40:24.535 --> 00:40:28.896
surfaces fitting together that
underlies so much biology.

00:40:28.896 --> 00:40:31.000
What's this?

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.785
This is a tumor cell.

00:40:32.785 --> 00:40:37.718
These are cytotoxic T cells
that have recognized this tumor

00:40:37.718 --> 00:40:42.310
cell is doing something it
shouldn't that a normal cell

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:43.331
wouldn't do.

00:40:43.331 --> 00:40:47.073
And it's attacking it,
and it's killing them.

00:40:47.073 --> 00:40:52.260
So, not only does the cellular
immune response help us against

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:56.173
things like infections from
virus and bacteria,

00:40:56.173 --> 00:41:00.000
it also will help prevent
cancer.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:07.654
So obviously there must be some
trick here to why we don't see

00:41:07.654 --> 00:41:09.788
our own peptides.

00:41:09.788 --> 00:41:16.439
This is the self versus
non-self And it's a relatively

00:41:16.439 --> 00:41:18.572
simple principle.

00:41:18.572 --> 00:41:26.352
So, distinguishing self versus
non-self is a problem throughout

00:41:26.352 --> 00:41:32.000
this whole part of the immune
system.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.605
And here's the principle.

00:41:36.605 --> 00:41:43.236
During embryogenesis,
the cell makes,

00:41:43.236 --> 00:41:50.973
the organism I guess,
makes the assumption.

00:41:50.973 --> 00:42:00.000
I mean obviously it's not
thinking about it.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:09.126
This is a way of understanding
what's happening.

00:42:09.126 --> 00:42:20.000
It makes the assumption that no
pathogens are present.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:34.177
Any B or T cell recognizing
something must be recognizing

00:42:34.177 --> 00:42:35.949
itself.

00:42:35.949 --> 00:42:45.569
And so, it deletes those B and
T cells.

00:42:45.569 --> 00:42:52.911
This process is given a name.

00:42:52.911 --> 00:43:00.000
It's called education.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:07.437
And it happens in this organ
called thymus.

00:43:07.437 --> 00:43:14.875
So, and then after birth,
then it switches.

00:43:14.875 --> 00:43:23.729
And now B and T cells,
if they recognize something,

00:43:23.729 --> 00:43:34.000
the body makes the assumption
it must be a pathogen.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.722
And it goes after it.

00:43:35.722 --> 00:43:39.987
We have this huge human disease
where that goes awry:

00:43:39.987 --> 00:43:44.252
rheumatoid arthritis,
or multiple sclerosis are cases

00:43:44.252 --> 00:43:49.009
where the self versus non-self
recognition has broken down.

00:43:49.009 --> 00:43:53.438
OK, so for example multiple
sclerosis, a very difficult

00:43:53.438 --> 00:43:57.867
disease, because there's a
gradual deterioration of the

00:43:57.867 --> 00:44:00.000
nervous system.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.828
And what happens is the body of
the person with that mounts an

00:44:03.828 --> 00:44:07.405
immune response against the
sheath that covers the nerves,

00:44:07.405 --> 00:44:10.920
and then that sheath gets
destroyed, and that the nervous

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:14.811
system, somebody with multiple
sclerosis, starts to break down.

00:44:14.811 --> 00:44:18.514
And so, if you lose this self
versus non-self you get what's

00:44:18.514 --> 00:44:20.334
called an autoimmune disease.

00:44:20.334 --> 00:44:22.280
You may have heard that phrase.

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.535
It's very important.

00:44:23.535 --> 00:44:26.548
It's a very tough thing if you
have one of these.

00:44:26.548 --> 00:44:30.000
But that's what lies at the
heart of it.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.209
And people still don't know,
but there is certainly some

00:44:33.209 --> 00:44:36.651
evidence for some of these that
are triggered by a bacterial

00:44:36.651 --> 00:44:37.235
infection.

00:44:37.235 --> 00:44:40.735
So, it could be that perhaps
maybe a bacterial protein looked

00:44:40.735 --> 00:44:44.294
close enough to one of your own
proteins, that somehow you got

00:44:44.294 --> 00:44:47.270
antibodies against the
bacterium, and then it turned

00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:50.188
out it could also recognize
something in your body.

00:44:50.188 --> 00:44:53.572
There are some other immune
diseases you probably heard of,

00:44:53.572 --> 00:44:55.555
the baby in a bubble kind of
thing.

00:44:55.555 --> 00:44:59.231
There are a few people who were
born who have no immune response

00:44:59.231 --> 00:45:02.557
at all because one of the basic
pieces for doing those DNA

00:45:02.557 --> 00:45:06.000
gymnastics I talked about isn't
there.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.682
Those people have no B cells or
T cells.

00:45:08.682 --> 00:45:11.984
They die unless they are
absolutely shielded from

00:45:11.984 --> 00:45:13.084
everything else.

00:45:13.084 --> 00:45:16.317
And that's one of those cases
when gene therapy,

00:45:16.317 --> 00:45:20.306
if you could get that gene into
that person, they'd have an

00:45:20.306 --> 00:45:22.576
immune system and they could
live.

00:45:22.576 --> 00:45:26.497
There are other kinds of immune
deficiencies that are less

00:45:26.497 --> 00:45:30.280
extreme, but nevertheless,
people will be susceptible to

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.000
infection.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.870
The other one which I've
already talked about,

00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:37.804
but now you can see in another
context is AIDS,

00:45:37.804 --> 00:45:40.036
Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome.

00:45:40.036 --> 00:45:43.544
And I told you what the HIV
virus does is it injects its

00:45:43.544 --> 00:45:43.799
RNA.

00:45:43.799 --> 00:45:45.202
That makes a DNA copy.

00:45:45.202 --> 00:45:46.542
It goes into protein.

00:45:46.542 --> 00:45:50.369
The cells that it affects our
special type of T cell called T

00:45:50.369 --> 00:45:51.198
helper cells.

00:45:51.198 --> 00:45:55.025
What they are doesn't matter so
much, but what's important to

00:45:55.025 --> 00:46:00.000
know is they're needed for both
branches of the immune system.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.674
They play roles in the humoral
response and cellular response.

00:46:03.674 --> 00:46:07.168
So, someone who gets infected
with HIV, what happens is the

00:46:07.168 --> 00:46:09.819
virus is replicating in these
helper T cells.

00:46:09.819 --> 00:46:13.253
And so their immune system is
slowly, slowly being knocked

00:46:13.253 --> 00:46:13.554
away.

00:46:13.554 --> 00:46:16.566
And the last thing,
which I won't have time to talk

00:46:16.566 --> 00:46:19.939
about, but if you have an
allergy, that's an overreaction

00:46:19.939 --> 00:46:21.204
of the immune system.

00:46:21.204 --> 00:46:22.831
So this is my last lecture.

00:46:22.831 --> 00:46:24.518
I've got to let you guys go.

00:46:24.518 --> 00:46:27.891
It's been a true pleasure to
talk to you; A real honor to

00:46:27.891 --> 00:46:30.000
meet many of you.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.902
And many of you put a lot of
effort into those little

00:46:33.902 --> 00:46:34.503
answers.

00:46:34.503 --> 00:46:36.904
I really, really appreciate
that.

00:46:36.904 --> 00:46:41.482
For those who'd rather not be
here, I hope that somewhere down

00:46:41.482 --> 00:46:46.210
the line when you're confronted
with a medical situation dealing

00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:49.137
with your parents,
your child, yourself,

00:46:49.137 --> 00:46:52.590
whatever it is,
that some of the stuff that you

00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:56.492
heard will reemerge to help you
with those decisions.

00:46:56.492 --> 00:47:00.845
And I wish you the best of luck
for the rest of the course,

00:47:00.845 --> 00:47:04.298
and the rest of your careers at
MIT and beyond.

00:47:04.298 --> 00:47:07.000
Thanks very much.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.302
And as I leave,
too, I've had the pleasure of

00:47:10.302 --> 00:47:13.303
just having an incredible
teaching staff.

00:47:13.303 --> 00:47:17.506
I don't think you guys know how
hard they work behind the

00:47:17.506 --> 00:47:20.839
scenes, but thanks to all of you
for being with me.
