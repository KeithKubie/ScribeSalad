CESAR HIDALGO: So my
name is Cesar Hidalgo

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.019
and I'm a Professor
at the MIT Media

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:06.824
Lab, where I run a group
called Macro Connections.

00:00:06.824 --> 00:00:08.740
And today I'm here
promoting this little baby.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.310
It took me 2 and 1/2
years to give birth to it,

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.230
and it's called "Why
Information Grows."

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.530
The story of the book
actually is quite simple.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.850
The idea is that the universe is
made of three things-- energy,

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.320
matter, and information.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.454
But information is the one that
makes the universe interesting.

00:00:25.454 --> 00:00:27.370
Information is the one
that gives the universe

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:33.154
its structure, its beauty,
and its complexity.

00:00:33.154 --> 00:00:34.820
But for the most part,
we have struggled

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.240
to understand where
information comes from.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.170
So what I'm going to do
in the next 40 minutes

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.990
is explain to you
what information is,

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.236
where it comes from, and
how it manages to grow.

00:00:47.236 --> 00:00:49.110
And to understand the
origins of information,

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.651
we have to understand
how information

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:52.960
is related to matter
because, as Landauer

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.710
repeated an infinite number of
times, information is physical.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.090
It's always embodied on physical
states, physical particles.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.569
In some way, despite the
physicality of information,

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:06.160
it is one of the
latest things that we

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.500
have been able to understand
from a physical perspective.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.820
Some of the first people to
start thinking about this

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.380
were people in the 19th
century like Ludwig Boltzmann.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.360
Now, Boltzmann was a famous
statistical physicist, but also

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.370
a relatively sad man.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.660
He ended his own life in 1906.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.140
And he ended own
life after having

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.280
gone through a
scientific career that

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.000
was full of very
fruitful results,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.700
but also results
that were sometimes

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.530
rejected by his colleagues.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.449
Boltzmann had, for
instance, advocated

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:39.490
for the idea of atoms,
and many of his colleagues

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.260
believed that atoms were nothing
more than a convenient analogy

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.004
and they should
not be incorporated

00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:45.920
into scientific theories
because they were not

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.910
directly observable.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.460
Boltzmann also was
inspired by some people

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.070
that had produced great
scientific results a little bit

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.260
before him.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.855
Two of where Charles
Darwin and Alfred Wallace.

00:01:57.855 --> 00:02:00.920
And Boltzmann had seen in
Darwin's and Wallace's theory

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.170
of evolution through
natural selection,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.160
an explanation of the
biological origins of order.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.220
And what he wanted
to do in his life

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.880
was actually develop
an explanation

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.769
of the physical
origins of order.

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.560
So he tried to understand
systems that were

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.000
composed of many particles.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.330
And what he realized is that
those systems eventually do not

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.110
go towards order, but
go towards disorder.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.030
That was something
that also troubled him.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.613
Because the thing
is that the universe

00:02:27.613 --> 00:02:30.010
has a tendency to
average itself out.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.910
This is known as the second
law of thermodynamics.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.860
So think about a
very simple example.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.680
I am now speaking in this room.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.440
And as I speak in this
room, I'm technically

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.130
writing on pressure
waves on air.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.470
But those pressure ways on
the air are very short lived.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.930
These pressure waves
move around the room.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.930
Basically, the particles that
have differences in pressure

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.290
average out and that
sound disappears,

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.380
and that information is not
embodied in the air anymore.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.850
And the same is true for
a lot of physical systems.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.434
So you take a cup of coffee and
you put milk in the beginning,

00:03:03.434 --> 00:03:05.225
you have all of these
beautiful swirls that

00:03:05.225 --> 00:03:07.715
are full of correlations and
very interesting informations

00:03:07.715 --> 00:03:09.930
and fractural structures
that after a while

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.915
is just a hazy cloud in which
everything is kind of mixed.

00:03:13.915 --> 00:03:16.040
And the universe has this
tendency of mixing things

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.460
in ways that are not mixable.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.160
The thing that you cannot
unmix is temperature,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.860
and that's what
Boltzmann discovered.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.299
So the question of
where order comes from

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.590
was a question that actually
eluded not only Boltzmann,

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.290
but many great scientists
that came after him

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.460
and tried to continue to
develop the statistical physics

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.620
that Boltzmann had started.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.070
This included Maxwell,
Einstein, and Gibbs.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.180
And the true
breakthrough happened

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.050
in the first half
of the 20th century

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.520
when the Russian
born and Belgian

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.877
raised statistical physicist
Ilya Prigogine started

00:03:48.877 --> 00:03:50.710
to look at systems that
were a bit different

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.200
than the ones that had been
looked at by Boltzmann.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.160
Prigogine realized that
Boltzmann was right,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.105
that physical systems that
are composed of many particles

00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:01.480
when left to their own devices
would go to an equilibrium

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:11.460
state in which basically,
all particles more or less

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.830
are moving willy nilly.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.940
And even though they
encode technically

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.190
a lot of information
in their quantum states

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.620
or in the positions and
velocities that they have,

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.570
they do not encode much order.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.070
And Prigogine also
wanted to explain

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.020
the origins of
physical order, but he

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.570
realized that in
order to do so, you

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.340
had to look at a little
bit of a different system.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.720
The systems that Boltzmann,
Einstein, Maxwell, and Gibbs

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.340
had looked at were systems
that were in equilibrium--

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.090
basically, when looking
at the state of the coffee

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.280
and the milk after the
milk had been in the coffee

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.344
for a long time and
everything had mixed up.

00:04:45.344 --> 00:04:47.260
Prigogine realized that
what he had to look at

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.406
were systems that were
out of equilibrium.

00:04:49.406 --> 00:04:51.280
And what he realized is
that the systems that

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.750
were out of equilibrium
satisfied a different objective

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:54.900
function.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.410
The systems that are in
equilibrium maximize entropy.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.260
The systems that are out
of equilibrium, Prigogine

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.355
showed in a very
particular example,

00:05:04.355 --> 00:05:08.207
they minimize the rate
of entropy production.

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:09.040
What does that mean?

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.740
Well, the systems are
producing entropy,

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.265
but are producing as
little entropy as possible.

00:05:13.265 --> 00:05:15.170
And when the systems
self organize

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.090
to produce as little
entropy as possible

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.170
is where order emerges.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.940
So the classic example of
this is the bathtub whirlpool.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.220
How many of you have used
a bathtub in your lives?

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.660
I assume most of you
have used a bathtub.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.076
And you have made
this observation

00:05:28.076 --> 00:05:29.664
that when you take
the plunger out

00:05:29.664 --> 00:05:31.809
of the bathtub and the
water starts racing down

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:33.225
the drain, at some
point, there is

00:05:33.225 --> 00:05:35.460
a little whirlpool that forms.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.320
That whirlpool is actually
a very simple form

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.420
of physical order
that is emerging

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.900
in the steady state of
a dynamical system that

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.370
is out of equilibrium.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.959
Why?

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:47.000
Because in this whirlpool,
if you think about it,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.991
if you know the
velocity of a particle,

00:05:48.991 --> 00:05:50.990
you very much know the
velocity of the particles

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.702
that are neighboring that.

00:05:52.702 --> 00:05:53.910
They tend to be very similar.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.700
But since these
particles are correlated

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:56.860
and they're moving
with velocities

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.693
that are similar to
that of their neighbors,

00:05:58.693 --> 00:06:00.920
they're not dissipating
too much energy

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.670
because they don't
have too much friction,

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.290
or interactions that
are not happening

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.081
at speeds that are highly
dissimilar between these two

00:06:08.081 --> 00:06:08.580
particles.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.730
So they're minimizing the rate
at which they dissipate energy.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.770
And in that state in
which they minimize

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.490
the rate at which
they dissipate energy,

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.530
order starts to emerge for free.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.335
But the big lesson
here is actually

00:06:19.335 --> 00:06:21.710
that in order to generate
physical order and information,

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.710
there is an energy cost.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.570
You cannot produce order
without spending energy.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.230
And that's a fundamental
thermodynamic relationship.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.390
You cannot record a video on
your phone when your battery is

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:33.690
gone.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:39.698
The thing is the origins
of physical order

00:06:39.698 --> 00:06:41.628
were explained by
Prigogine by looking out

00:06:41.628 --> 00:06:43.650
of equilibrium systems
does not help us explain

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.750
more complex forms
of physical order,

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.330
like the ones, for instance,
that we observe in our cities

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.924
or in our homes, or in
the economy at large.

00:06:51.924 --> 00:06:53.340
For that maybe
we're going to need

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.530
to have a few other
additional principles that

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.240
help us understand
how order continues

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.610
to grow to the extent in
which it's able to produce

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.422
the type of complexity
that we observe

00:07:05.422 --> 00:07:07.420
in nature and in society.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.200
So the second ingredient for
the physical origins of order

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.005
was one what was hinted at by
Erwin Schrodinger in his 1944

00:07:14.005 --> 00:07:15.670
book, "What is Life."

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.289
So Schrodinger in his book "What
is Life" already acknowledges

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:19.830
and recognizes that
life is a machine

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.480
that is going against the
second law of thermodynamics.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.232
It's minimizing
entropy internally

00:07:25.232 --> 00:07:27.410
and obviously, we
are producing heat

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:31.319
at our seams to make sure that
the entropy in the universe

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:32.610
at large continues to increase.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.850
But locally, we
eat food and we use

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.250
that energy to produce order.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.024
But the thing is
if we always have

00:07:39.024 --> 00:07:40.440
to be producing
order by consuming

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.319
energy, the amount of
order that we would be

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:43.610
able to produce is very little.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.640
So we have to have a way of
saving that order, marking sure

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.950
that order endures, perseveres.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.790
So what Schrodinger
said in some sense,

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:55.150
one of the tricks that life had
figured out to help order grow

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.015
and to help information grow
was to store that information

00:07:58.015 --> 00:07:59.590
in aperiodic crystals.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:00.830
Think of proteins.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:01.680
Think of DNA.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.800
Think of RNA.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.155
All of these molecules
are actually quite stable.

00:08:05.155 --> 00:08:06.250
DNA is very stable.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.750
You can store it
at room temperature

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.625
for a very long time.

00:08:08.625 --> 00:08:11.150
And it's able to
preserve information,

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:15.020
and it's able to
in some way obviate

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.170
the second law of
thermodynamics, at least

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:17.900
temporarily.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.440
And because solids
make order endure,

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.190
once you're able to store
information in solids,

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.240
you don't need to be
creating it all the time.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.918
You can start recombining it
and you can help order grow.

00:08:28.918 --> 00:08:30.412
So that's the second trick.

00:08:30.412 --> 00:08:32.909
The second trick is that you
need to preserve information.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:34.184
And for that, you need solids.

00:08:34.184 --> 00:08:38.500
But there's one more trick
that nature has in its

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.549
[INAUDIBLE] that
helps order grow

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:41.860
in pockets of the universe.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.940
This one is the capacity
of matter to compute.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.940
People tend to think of
computation as something

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.956
that we invented recently.

00:08:48.956 --> 00:08:51.790
But actually, computation
started with the big bang.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.370
Every time two physical
particles interact,

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.140
they're actually
exchanging information,

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.930
and that's an act
of computation.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.084
They're processing information.

00:09:00.084 --> 00:09:03.250
And computation is actually
a prerequisite of life.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:07.040
So just to give you an idea of
how fundamental computation is,

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.665
I'm going to use as an example
a tree because people don't tend

00:09:09.665 --> 00:09:11.160
to think of trees as computers.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.000
But trees are computers.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.970
They don't have
consciousness like you and I,

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.089
and they cannot run MATLAB or
R or Python like the digital

00:09:18.089 --> 00:09:20.380
computers that we have built,
but they can run actually

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.720
programs that maybe are even
more sophisticated than those.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:27.560
A tree knows how
to grow its leaves

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.880
in a certain direction and
its roots in a direction

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.490
of the world that it needs.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:35.670
A tree knows how to turn genes
on and off to fight off pests.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:39.190
A tree also knows how to
perform photosynthesis.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.340
A tree knows when
to shed its leaves

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.136
and when to grow them again.

00:09:43.136 --> 00:09:44.510
These are all acts
of computation

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.672
that a tree is performing
because in some sense,

00:09:47.672 --> 00:09:50.680
the tree is a computer
that is building itself

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:55.160
from the intimacy of the cells
to the totality of its larger

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.730
structure.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.094
So for information to
grow in the universe

00:09:59.094 --> 00:10:01.900
and to exist despite the
second law of thermodynamics,

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.650
the universe has three
fundamental tricks.

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.324
The first one is that you
need to spend some energy.

00:10:06.324 --> 00:10:08.490
You cannot get information
in an equilibrium system.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:12.030
It has to get out of equilibrium
system because information,

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.224
order are not free.

00:10:14.224 --> 00:10:15.934
The second thing
is that you need

00:10:15.934 --> 00:10:17.600
to have ways of saving
that information.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.099
You need to have
some sort of solid.

00:10:19.099 --> 00:10:24.080
And here, be very in some sense
general in the use of the word

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.690
"solids."

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.860
When you have spins
in a hard drive,

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.740
you can also think
that in some sense,

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.677
as long as those spins are
stable in that hard drive,

00:10:31.677 --> 00:10:32.510
that's a solid, too.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:35.200
It doesn't have to be something
like a totem in which we're

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.060
passing on cultural information
by carving it on wood.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.180
It can be actually a very
general thing about something

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:46.760
that is not a fluid, that
has a state of stasis that is

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.880
stable to thermal fluctuations.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.700
That's what I mean
by a solid here.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.890
And finally, by
using solids, energy,

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.630
matter develops the
capacity to compute,

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:58.210
which is the capacity to
recompile information.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:00.790
So what we will see now is
that this capacity to compute

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:03.469
is actually the key to
make possible the growth

00:11:03.469 --> 00:11:04.760
of information in the universe.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.676
But it also has made the
growth of information

00:11:06.676 --> 00:11:07.986
in the universe very difficult.

00:11:07.986 --> 00:11:09.530
So what I'm going
to do next is I'm

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:11.870
going to take these three
fundamental mechanism

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:14.560
and I'm going to look now
at society and the economy.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.935
And I'm going to try to explain
how information continues

00:11:16.935 --> 00:11:20.549
to grow at the high level of
complexity that you and I live.

00:11:20.549 --> 00:11:22.215
So the first thing
that I need to answer

00:11:22.215 --> 00:11:24.650
to be able to explain
that is, what are

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:29.182
the types of information
that we produce in society

00:11:29.182 --> 00:11:30.564
and that we use in society?

00:11:30.564 --> 00:11:32.480
And to do that, I'm going
to tell you a story.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.979
So I'm originally from Chile,
and I've been living in the US

00:11:34.979 --> 00:11:36.790
for 11 years now.

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:39.122
And if anybody here
probably has moved out

00:11:39.122 --> 00:11:41.922
of their home country, where
you find yourself is that when

00:11:41.922 --> 00:11:44.001
you're procrastinating
online, often, you're

00:11:44.001 --> 00:11:46.084
going to go and visit a
newspaper from the country

00:11:46.084 --> 00:11:47.370
that you were born.

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.122
There's not many
interesting news there.

00:11:50.122 --> 00:11:51.330
It's kind of like local news.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.310
And once, there was this news,
"Chilean Bought the World's

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:55.728
Most Expensive Car."

00:11:55.728 --> 00:11:58.820
And obviously, my first reaction
was like, what a douche.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.360
Why do you need to buy a
car that's so expensive?

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.300
But then eventually, I
started thinking about,

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.245
what car was it, and
how much was it worth?

00:12:06.245 --> 00:12:07.920
And the car was
a Bugatti Veyron.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.950
So I searched online.

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.015
And a Bugatti Veyron
costs $2 and 1/2 million,

00:12:11.015 --> 00:12:14.930
and that's $1,300 a kilo.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:16.640
So obviously, you
think that, well,

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.864
why is this guy thinking
about how much does

00:12:18.864 --> 00:12:19.780
a kilo of a car worth?

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.274
This is not rice or beans or
things that you buy per kilo.

00:12:23.274 --> 00:12:24.732
But thinking of a
kilo of a Bugatti

00:12:24.732 --> 00:12:26.107
is interesting
because it's going

00:12:26.107 --> 00:12:29.450
to teach us an important lesson
about the nature of information

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:30.546
in the economy.

00:12:30.546 --> 00:12:31.920
So imagine that
you have just won

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.390
this vehicle on the lottery,
and you're driving it

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:38.190
through the city, very excited
because this is a brand new car

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.257
and you're all pumped up.

00:12:39.257 --> 00:12:39.840
And then boom!

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.060
You crash it against the wall.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.207
Now, how much is that
kilo of Bugatti worth?

00:12:45.207 --> 00:12:47.040
Obviously, you don't
need a PhD in economics

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.490
to know that a kilo
of a Bugatti now

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:50.940
is worth way less than before.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.880
The value evaporated
when you crashed that car

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.860
against that wall.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:57.484
And what this is telling you as
well that the value of that car

00:12:57.484 --> 00:12:59.400
was not related to the
atoms, but was related

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.620
to the way in which those
atoms were ordered or arranged,

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:02.666
and that is information.

00:13:02.666 --> 00:13:06.070
So the Bugatti was
made of information

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:07.590
even though it
was not a message.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:10.530
It was an object.

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.182
So let's try to understand
a little bit more

00:13:13.182 --> 00:13:15.046
about the types of
information that we have

00:13:15.046 --> 00:13:16.170
in society and the economy.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.003
And the second example
that I'm going to use

00:13:18.003 --> 00:13:21.150
is I'm going to ask you guys
to compare apples and apples.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.638
And on the left, you have the
Apples that here in Google

00:13:23.638 --> 00:13:24.138
detest.

00:13:24.138 --> 00:13:25.846
And on the right,
you have the ones

00:13:25.846 --> 00:13:28.260
that you buy in the
supermarket that you eat.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.811
And the question
I'm going to ask

00:13:29.811 --> 00:13:32.310
you is, what is the fundamental
difference between these two

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:33.725
types of products?

00:13:33.725 --> 00:13:37.097
Obviously, they both contain
information and physical order.

00:13:37.097 --> 00:13:38.930
And some people might
say price, some people

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:39.805
might say complexity.

00:13:39.805 --> 00:13:42.210
But I can basically
argue that the apple

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.040
on the right, the
one that you eat,

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.788
has molecular mechanisms
inside its cells

00:13:45.788 --> 00:13:47.070
that are unparalleled by
anything that has been built

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.044
by an engineer in the world.

00:13:49.044 --> 00:13:52.952
So the true difference
is not in their price,

00:13:52.952 --> 00:13:54.160
it's not in their complexity.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.600
It's not in the fact that
one of them has information

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.040
and the other one doesn't
because both have information.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.414
The true difference is that
the first apple existed first

00:14:01.414 --> 00:14:03.710
in the world and
then in your heads,

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:05.945
and the second
Apple existed first

00:14:05.945 --> 00:14:07.746
in someone's head and
then in the world.

00:14:07.746 --> 00:14:10.640
The first apple existed before
there was a name for apples,

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.330
a price for apples, and
a market for apples.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.100
So what this telling us is that
the second Apple is special

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.320
because it is a
crystal of imagination.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.320
And that's an observation
that is very important

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.930
because we live in a
world that is tangible,

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:27.310
but that tangibility is
actually made of fiction.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:29.810
All of the objects that we
have-- the clothes that we

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:32.240
wear, the shoes, the
computers that we use,

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.531
the cars that we drive, the
buildings that we live in--

00:14:34.531 --> 00:14:36.500
were all imagined
before they were built.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.140
And by noticing that
the products that we

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.895
make in our economy are
crystals of imagination,

00:14:41.895 --> 00:14:45.180
we can interpret important
economic processes.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.635
So we can reinterpret the
economy based on the idea

00:14:47.635 --> 00:14:50.900
that products are made of
crystallized imagination.

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.156
So as an example,
let's take some data

00:14:53.156 --> 00:14:54.520
from the Observatory of
Economic Complexity, which

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.840
is a data visualization engine
that I created with my team

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.435
at MIT.

00:14:57.435 --> 00:15:00.230
And here are the products that
Chile exports to South Korea.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:01.755
And you see there
are two things.

00:15:01.755 --> 00:15:05.390
On aggregate, you see that
Chile exports $4.6 billion.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.890
But in this more
desirable view, you

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:09.488
see what Chile exports
to South Korea.

00:15:09.488 --> 00:15:11.990
And you see that Chile exports
to South Korea mostly atoms--

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:16.166
refined copper, copper ores, and
pig meat, grapes, and so forth.

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:18.774
Now, what does Chile
buy from South Korea?

00:15:18.774 --> 00:15:21.250
What Chile buys from South
Korea are cars, machines,

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:22.950
and delivery trucks.

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:25.940
In total, they're buying
only $2.5 million.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:30.382
So what that means is that
Chile has a positive trade

00:15:30.382 --> 00:15:33.650
surplus with Korea because
they're exporting 4.6 billion

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:38.490
and buying 2.5 But they have a
negative imagination surplus.

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.190
They have a negative
imagination balance

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:43.860
because Chile is
exporting atoms and Korea,

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.610
what it's sending back
is the way in which

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:46.785
those atoms are arranged.

00:15:46.785 --> 00:15:48.160
And what this is
starting to tell

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.862
us is that eventually,
economies are computers, and are

00:15:52.862 --> 00:15:54.650
computers with
different capacities.

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:56.552
And as we will see by
the end of this talk,

00:15:56.552 --> 00:15:59.010
the different computational
capacity of different economies

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:00.870
can help us even explain
the level of income

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:03.554
that each economy
is able to achieve.

00:16:03.554 --> 00:16:04.970
In this case, it
should be obvious

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:06.386
that the economy
of South Korea is

00:16:06.386 --> 00:16:08.491
a more sophisticated
computer than that of Chile,

00:16:08.491 --> 00:16:10.750
is able to generate
more sophisticated forms

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.710
of physical order.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.560
Another thing that,
for example, thinking

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.726
about the world in terms
of crystallized imagination

00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:18.370
helps us reinterpret
is the dynamics

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:19.911
of natural resource
exploitation that

00:16:19.911 --> 00:16:21.766
are prevalent in many
developing countries.

00:16:21.766 --> 00:16:23.130
I come from Chile.

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:25.894
And as you've seen, Chile
basically sells rocks.

00:16:25.894 --> 00:16:28.735
Why the heck we
sell so many rocks?

00:16:28.735 --> 00:16:32.170
Every year, Chile exports
roughly $50 billion

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.490
worth of rocks.

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:37.580
Why is the world willing to pay
so much money for those rocks?

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.905
Those green rocks
are rocks of copper,

00:16:40.905 --> 00:16:42.805
and people are willing
to pay for copper.

00:16:42.805 --> 00:16:45.504
Well, because copper, once
you melt it and make it

00:16:45.504 --> 00:16:46.920
into a spaghetti,
you can actually

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.230
conduct electricity quite as
well-- not as good as gold,

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.410
but much cheaper than gold.

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.770
So some people say, well,
Chile is being exploited

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:58.280
because people are taking
these rocks out of Chile that

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.146
are very valuable.

00:16:59.146 --> 00:17:01.020
And then basically, what
is Chile getting out

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.465
of this other than
some miners that

00:17:03.465 --> 00:17:07.522
live in some towns that
are pretty desolate and $50

00:17:07.522 --> 00:17:08.022
million?

00:17:08.022 --> 00:17:10.502
And the thing is, well,
you have to think about,

00:17:10.502 --> 00:17:12.407
where is that value
actually coming from?

00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:13.490
Is the value on the atoms?

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:14.573
Is the value on the rocks?

00:17:14.573 --> 00:17:17.010
Or was the value endowed
to the rocks by some sort

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.349
of computational process?

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:21.602
So we are buying
these rocks now.

00:17:21.602 --> 00:17:23.810
And we were not buying these
rocks for a lot of money

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:28.620
300 years ago because
roughly 150 years ago, there

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:31.634
was a guy called Michael
Faraday that figured out

00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:35.190
that if you jiggle a
magnet inside a coil,

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:37.446
you can produce electricity.

00:17:37.446 --> 00:17:40.765
That knowledge
eventually is the one

00:17:40.765 --> 00:17:42.765
that allows us to live
in this electrified world

00:17:42.765 --> 00:17:44.848
that we live in nowadays
that allows us to produce

00:17:44.848 --> 00:17:47.590
a large amount of information
because we have transformed

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:49.685
that energy that helps
us produce information

00:17:49.685 --> 00:17:51.360
in the form of electricity.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.990
But it's also that piece of
knowledge and that piece of

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:57.818
know how that endowed
those rocks with all

00:17:57.818 --> 00:17:59.484
of that economic value.

00:17:59.484 --> 00:18:02.710
So in some sense, we can
say that Chile is not

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:05.633
being exploited because people
are taking rocks out of Chile.

00:18:05.633 --> 00:18:07.216
Chile is actually
exploiting knowledge

00:18:07.216 --> 00:18:10.734
and know how that was
produced elsewhere.

00:18:10.734 --> 00:18:12.150
So the question
then is, well, why

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:13.400
do we crystallize imagination?

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.510
One thing that you
might have not noticed

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:18.630
is that we make products
that are tangible

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.670
but that started as fiction,
and we're the only species

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:23.112
to do so.

00:18:23.112 --> 00:18:24.570
There's no other
species that makes

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:27.820
products that are tangible and
that started as imagination.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.290
And if you see pictures of
elephants making drawings

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:33.782
on the internet, they basically
get whipped the heck out

00:18:33.782 --> 00:18:37.782
of in very
questionable practices

00:18:37.782 --> 00:18:40.240
to make sure that they make
the same drawing over and over.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.400
So it's not like the elephant
has this artistic expression.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.165
And we do tons of
different things.

00:18:46.165 --> 00:18:47.790
We crystallize
imagination [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:49.123
We're the only species to do so.

00:18:49.123 --> 00:18:52.253
So there must have some
benefit, because certainly, it

00:18:52.253 --> 00:18:52.950
has a cost.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:53.760
Work is hard.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.851
So what are the benefits of
crystallized imagination?

00:18:56.851 --> 00:18:58.392
So to answer that
question, I'm going

00:18:58.392 --> 00:19:00.642
to ask you another question,
which is, how many of you

00:19:00.642 --> 00:19:01.817
used toothpaste today?

00:19:01.817 --> 00:19:04.074
Please raise your hand if
you used toothpaste today.

00:19:04.074 --> 00:19:05.240
Sir, did you use toothpaste?

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:05.740
Thank you.

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.929
And keep your hand
up because I'm

00:19:07.929 --> 00:19:10.040
going to ask you a
follow-up question now.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.580
Keep your hand up
only if you know

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:15.260
how to synthesize sodium
fluoride, if you know how

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.990
to synthesize sodium fluoride.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:19.197
I don't know how to
synthesize sodium fluoride,

00:19:19.197 --> 00:19:20.326
but what does that tell us?

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:21.951
It's that when we're
buying toothpaste,

00:19:21.951 --> 00:19:24.560
we're not just buying
some goo on a tube.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:28.320
What we're buying is access to
the practical uses of knowledge

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.712
and know how that resides
in the nervous systems

00:19:30.712 --> 00:19:32.230
of other people.

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:35.044
So products augment us.

00:19:35.044 --> 00:19:36.586
And this augmentation
is the one that

00:19:36.586 --> 00:19:39.002
makes these products useful
because at the end of the day,

00:19:39.002 --> 00:19:41.675
because of products, we're going
to live at a level of capacity

00:19:41.675 --> 00:19:45.216
and a level of prosperity that
is much larger than the one

00:19:45.216 --> 00:19:48.270
that we would be able to
achieve if we were to live left

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.754
to our own devices.

00:19:49.754 --> 00:19:52.540
We don't have the
knowledge and know how

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:55.870
that we require to make all
of the things that we use.

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:57.847
But nevertheless, we
access the practical uses

00:19:57.847 --> 00:19:59.930
of that knowledge and know
how-- not the knowledge

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.460
and know how-- through the
products that we consume.

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:09.630
So in that sense, as
a species, and we're

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:13.560
a social species-- we're somehow
similar to ants in the sense

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.510
that as a species, an
ability to coordinate things

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:19.280
comes from an ability to deposit
information in the environment.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.385
And ants individually
are not very smart.

00:20:22.385 --> 00:20:25.025
But they can do
great things, just

00:20:25.025 --> 00:20:27.270
like solving problems of
routing and ventilation

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:28.728
and construction
and transportation

00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:32.108
because they can put information
in their environments.

00:20:32.108 --> 00:20:34.860
And that allows them
to coordinate and act

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.765
as a collective
computer that is much

00:20:36.765 --> 00:20:38.764
smarter than an individual ant.

00:20:38.764 --> 00:20:42.380
But the thing is
ants are somehow,

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:47.542
in a way, limited because ants
can deposit information that is

00:20:47.542 --> 00:20:48.750
pre-specified in their genes.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:51.150
So they have a
physical vocabulary.

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:53.090
We're a little bit
different than ants.

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:55.400
We don't just
produce information

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.050
that was encoded in
our genes, but we also

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.483
need to pull information
that comes from our brains.

00:21:01.483 --> 00:21:03.633
And because of our ability
to pull information

00:21:03.633 --> 00:21:05.160
that comes from
our brains, we're

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.260
able to actually coordinate the
production of activities that

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.940
are much more complex and create
a society that is infinitely

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.330
more complex than that of ants.

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:16.300
So the next question
that I want to ask is,

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.640
how do we actually manage
to create those things?

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.742
In some sense, we're even aware
that it's literally fantastic.

00:21:21.742 --> 00:21:23.158
It's not metaphorically
fantastic.

00:21:23.158 --> 00:21:26.240
It's literally fantastic
that the objects that we

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.340
use on a daily basis
started all as fiction

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:33.070
and we have managed to transform
that fiction into reality.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.070
But sometimes, transforming
fiction into reality

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:36.492
is not that easy.

00:21:36.492 --> 00:21:38.075
Different countries
or different teams

00:21:38.075 --> 00:21:40.368
of people or different
companies struggle to do so.

00:21:40.368 --> 00:21:43.054
So there must be
some things that

00:21:43.054 --> 00:21:46.115
help us explain why some people
are better at crystallizing

00:21:46.115 --> 00:21:48.400
imagination than others.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.970
So what I want to
try to explain next

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:52.330
is what are the
mechanisms that enable

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.950
but also limit our ability
to crystallize information

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:58.430
and to make that
information grow.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:00.310
So a few years
ago, Pep Guardiola

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:02.272
visited MIT Media Lab.

00:22:02.272 --> 00:22:05.040
At that time, Guardiola
was between jobs.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.040
He had just finished his
tenure as a coach at Barcelona,

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.260
and he was moving to be the
head coach of Bayern Munich.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.660
And he visited the media lab.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.960
It was a visit that was
very easy to organize.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.870
I was put in charge of
organizing that visit,

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.540
and all the students
obviously wanted

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.926
to show something to
him, especially all

00:22:22.926 --> 00:22:24.999
the students that like soccer.

00:22:24.999 --> 00:22:26.040
So I organized the visit.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.360
And as I was organizing
the visit during that week,

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.430
I started to receive emails
from other students, especially

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:32.480
students from Spain and
Catalan students, that

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.255
wanted to really meet him.

00:22:34.255 --> 00:22:36.779
And I was supposed to keep
the visit kind of quiet.

00:22:36.779 --> 00:22:37.820
So I said, you know what?

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.134
What I can do is I'm
going to do the demos.

00:22:40.134 --> 00:22:41.942
I'm going to take
him around the lab.

00:22:41.942 --> 00:22:43.730
And then when we
finish the demos,

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:46.820
I'm going to bring him to the
atrium, and then we've got Q&amp;A.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.512
So then people
started to show up.

00:22:48.512 --> 00:22:50.386
And then during the
demos, there were a bunch

00:22:50.386 --> 00:22:51.740
of students sitting there
with the Barcelona shirts

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.198
and scarves and
everything, waiting

00:22:53.198 --> 00:22:55.322
to meet this soccer celebrity.

00:22:55.322 --> 00:22:56.780
So obviously, the
Q&amp;A gets started.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.239
The students were
a little bit shy.

00:22:58.239 --> 00:23:00.196
Eventually, a student
raises his hand and says,

00:23:00.196 --> 00:23:02.040
well, at MIT, we have
to work with robots.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:06.620
So my question to you, Pep, is
if we build a team of robots,

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:08.680
would you come and coach it?

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.130
And Pep's answer
was very cunning.

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:13.570
He said, when you're
trying to achieve something

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:17.060
with a group of people, like
in the case of a soccer team,

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:20.295
the most difficult thing is
not to figure out a game plan,

00:23:20.295 --> 00:23:23.350
but actually to
transmit to everybody

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:26.385
that game plan in the
voice of the players.

00:23:26.385 --> 00:23:28.760
In the case of robots, I don't
think that is a challenge.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.440
I'll decline your offer.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.970
So that answer was very
good because actually, it

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:36.360
points to the fact that
eventually, to achieve things,

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:37.425
we have to work in teams.

00:23:37.425 --> 00:23:39.710
And having that
teamwork as a unit

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:43.119
is sometimes what
is very difficult.

00:23:43.119 --> 00:23:45.560
And in some way, we
can ask ourselves,

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.340
why the heck do we
have to work in teams?

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:50.845
I assume all of you guys have
worked in teams in your life.

00:23:50.845 --> 00:23:53.535
And how many of you had a
friction with a colleague?

00:23:53.535 --> 00:23:54.504
All of you, exactly.

00:23:54.504 --> 00:23:56.920
If you work in a team, you had
a friction with a colleague

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:57.330
sooner or later.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:59.140
Even in playground,
kids know that lesson.

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.020
So [INAUDIBLE] a cost
of working in teams.

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:02.822
So there must be
benefits also to working

00:24:02.822 --> 00:24:07.145
in teams that help teams
prevail and make them grow.

00:24:07.145 --> 00:24:10.130
And to answer that
question of why

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:12.967
do we need to work in teams, I'm
going to ask you another very

00:24:12.967 --> 00:24:15.660
simple dental question,
which is, how long does it

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.664
take for a person
to become a dentist?

00:24:17.664 --> 00:24:22.820
How long does it take for a
person to become a dentist?

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:23.500
Any guesses?

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.370
AUDIENCE: Six years.

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:26.220
CESAR HIDALGO: Usually people
answer six or seven years.

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:28.303
But obviously, the answer
is 30 because the person

00:24:28.303 --> 00:24:31.500
needs to learn how to talk,
how to walk, how to socialize,

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.693
how to read, how to
write, how to do math.

00:24:34.693 --> 00:24:37.192
And then eventually, by the
time a person becomes a dentist,

00:24:37.192 --> 00:24:38.156
it's in their late
20s, early 30s.

00:24:38.156 --> 00:24:40.900
Their brain is half frozen and
there's not that much knowledge

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.858
or know how that you're
going to be able to get

00:24:42.858 --> 00:24:43.870
in a person's brain.

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:48.000
So the point of this is that
people have a finite capacity

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:48.705
to compute.

00:24:48.705 --> 00:24:50.710
And this is not just
a property of people,

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:53.360
but it's a property of
all computational systems.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.774
All computational systems have
a finite capacity to compute.

00:24:56.774 --> 00:24:57.440
Think of a cell.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.675
A biological cell
has a finite capacity

00:24:59.675 --> 00:25:01.340
to compute that
does not allow it

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:03.810
to do things that are as
sophisticated as the ones

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:04.930
that a human does.

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:07.560
But humans also have
a finite capacity

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.440
that they can only
transcend as long as they're

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:17.110
able to accumulate more capacity
in a social context as a team.

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:19.520
So in some way, we can
think that as a society,

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.960
we're a collective computer.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.140
And this collective
computer is accumulating

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.476
computational capacity.

00:25:24.476 --> 00:25:28.000
And in the beginning, when
things are relatively simple,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.140
the computational capacity
we need to do things,

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.860
let's say, if what
we're doing is just

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.730
creating some
wooden spheres, can

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:37.134
very well fit without a
person's capabilities.

00:25:37.134 --> 00:25:38.550
But at some point,
we start making

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:40.790
things that are more
complicated, more complex,

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.392
that require more knowledge,
more know how, more

00:25:42.392 --> 00:25:42.850
computational capacity.

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:44.673
What we're going to
do is we're going

00:25:44.673 --> 00:25:47.214
to cross a threshold which is
the personbyte threshold, which

00:25:47.214 --> 00:25:48.870
means that the computational
capacity that we need

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:50.819
to do something is
larger than the one

00:25:50.819 --> 00:25:54.900
that you can fit
inside a human being.

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.050
So when you're thinking
about information

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:01.287
in the context of math, bits
are a very natural unit.

00:26:01.287 --> 00:26:03.620
But when you're thinking about
computational information

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.370
in the context of
society, the person,

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:06.870
the amount of
knowledge and know how

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:09.230
that you can embody in a
person, is a natural unit.

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:09.730
Why?

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.240
Because that unit
then forces you

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.120
to re-quantize computational
knowledge and know how.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.520
That's the unit in which you
start parallelizing things

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:21.790
because your computer
cannot do much anymore.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.680
So the question
obviously is then, well,

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.960
what determines the size of
the networks that we can form?

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.820
We have to do things
in a social context.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.720
Computation is
distributed in society.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.220
Society is
[INAUDIBLE] a computer

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.790
that's made of networks.

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.820
So one other network theory
I guess is important for us

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.820
to understand the
computational capacities

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.107
of society and the world.

00:26:40.107 --> 00:26:42.440
And one of the first people
to start thinking about this

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.540
was Ronald Coase.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:47.194
Ronald Coase was living
here in London in the 1930s.

00:26:47.194 --> 00:26:49.975
He was a law student
and attended a seminar

00:26:49.975 --> 00:26:52.814
in the Department
of Commerce of LSE.

00:26:52.814 --> 00:26:56.476
And this seminar that I think
was taught by Professor Arnold

00:26:56.476 --> 00:27:00.653
Plant, there, Coase
heard a phrase

00:27:00.653 --> 00:27:01.920
that bothered him deeply.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.715
And the phrase was "the
normal economic system

00:27:05.715 --> 00:27:06.645
works itself out."

00:27:06.645 --> 00:27:08.834
It's kind of these
classical phrases

00:27:08.834 --> 00:27:10.750
that classical economists
love to throw around

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:13.124
that the economy
is self regulated,

00:27:13.124 --> 00:27:16.772
and everything happens magically
through this business story

00:27:16.772 --> 00:27:19.230
in which you have butchers and
bakers and horseshoe makers,

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:22.690
all trading things that find
prices optimally because

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:24.010
of the price mechanisms.

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:26.030
And this was 1931, 1932.

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:29.440
Ronald Coase was a
20-something-year-old.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.557
This was the time of
the Great Depression.

00:27:31.557 --> 00:27:33.140
And obviously, Coase
saw that the work

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.764
was very different than the one
that the Department of Commerce

00:27:35.764 --> 00:27:36.957
professor was telling him.

00:27:36.957 --> 00:27:38.415
Coase saw a world
in which a person

00:27:38.415 --> 00:27:40.270
who from one desk
to another desk

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:43.192
to change the task that
the person is doing

00:27:43.192 --> 00:27:45.830
is not because the price
mechanism in some way

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.496
realigned the incentives
of that person.

00:27:47.496 --> 00:27:49.290
It was because the
boss told that person

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:51.720
to move from here to there.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:54.590
So what Coase realized is
that the world was not just

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:57.130
like this fluid market that
economists talked about,

00:27:57.130 --> 00:28:00.513
but it was made of conscious
islands of centralized planning

00:28:00.513 --> 00:28:04.270
or power, which are firms and
organizations and institutions

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:05.130
and so forth.

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:08.520
So what he tried to
do, he said, well,

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.315
maybe I can try to
develop a theory of what

00:28:10.315 --> 00:28:11.690
is the size of
this network, what

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:13.340
is the size of these firms.

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.240
And that is the classic
idea of the firm that

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.576
was invented by Ronald Coase.

00:28:16.576 --> 00:28:17.825
And the theory is very simple.

00:28:17.825 --> 00:28:20.070
It's an equilibrium theory
in which, on the one hand,

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:21.667
when you have a
company, you always

00:28:21.667 --> 00:28:23.417
have to decide whether
you're going to buy

00:28:23.417 --> 00:28:24.940
or you're going to make.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.480
So on the one hand, let's
say at Google, you say,

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:30.227
hey, we need coffee.

00:28:30.227 --> 00:28:32.310
Probably you're not going
to start your own coffee

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:34.468
plantation and procure
your own coffee.

00:28:34.468 --> 00:28:36.359
In that case,
you're going to buy.

00:28:36.359 --> 00:28:38.692
But hey, maybe we need to
improve our data visualization

00:28:38.692 --> 00:28:39.710
skills.

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:42.120
Maybe we should hire
more people for the team.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.593
And in that case, maybe it
will increase our net worth

00:28:44.593 --> 00:28:46.815
because that's something
that we'd rather make.

00:28:46.815 --> 00:28:49.440
And companies are always making
this decision of whether to buy

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.365
or whether to make.

00:28:50.365 --> 00:28:53.310
And eventually, at the point
at which the cost of buying

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:55.092
and the cost of
making equalize, you

00:28:55.092 --> 00:28:57.130
have this membrane
that determines

00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:59.050
the size of the firm.

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:00.950
So that's Coase's
theory of the firm.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:02.780
What is most important
for us, though,

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.530
in the case of Coase's
theory of the firm,

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:06.290
is the transaction
cost theory that

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:09.340
also comes from it, which
tells you the following.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.080
It's that when you have a
system in which you are forming

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.210
networks, links have a cost.

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:17.502
The size of the networks
that you can form

00:29:17.502 --> 00:29:20.350
are inversely proportional
to the cost of links.

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:22.820
So in a world in which
links are very cheap,

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:26.040
you've got very large networks
which then have a lot of links.

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.090
In a world in which
links are very expensive,

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:33.010
the networks that you're going
to be able form are very small.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:35.623
So that is Coase's
theory of the firm.

00:29:35.623 --> 00:29:38.091
And it gives you some idea
of the size of the networks

00:29:38.091 --> 00:29:38.965
that people can form.

00:29:38.965 --> 00:29:41.375
But always, as all
theories, this theory

00:29:41.375 --> 00:29:44.475
also rubs some people in a
little bit of the wrong way.

00:29:44.475 --> 00:29:46.330
Some of the people
started to think

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:47.830
of the world a
little bit different,

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.017
and they thought that
the theories that

00:29:50.017 --> 00:29:53.130
were advanced by Coase and the
New Institutional Economists

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:56.001
were incomplete sociology,
such as Mark Granovetter.

00:29:56.001 --> 00:30:00.711
So Mark Granovetter actually
argued that economists had it

00:30:00.711 --> 00:30:03.070
completely backwards
because economists still

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:05.670
believe in a world in
which there are incentives,

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:07.780
and then people basically
connect with each other

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:09.200
based on those incentives.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.636
So if someone has something
that I want to buy,

00:30:11.636 --> 00:30:14.260
and that person is selling, and
we find ourselves miraculously,

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.968
through some sort of
magic of the market,

00:30:15.968 --> 00:30:18.800
and we perform that transaction.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.700
What that means is that the
link is an epiphenomenon

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:22.820
to economic activity.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.701
But what Granovetter
said is, well,

00:30:25.701 --> 00:30:27.450
obviously, when you're
buying a chocolate,

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:31.292
sure, you're going to go to
the closest Tesco or 7-11.

00:30:31.292 --> 00:30:33.465
You don't have to become
friends with the clerk

00:30:33.465 --> 00:30:35.850
to buy that little Snickers bar.

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:37.494
But in many cases,
actually, when

00:30:37.494 --> 00:30:39.410
you're doing things that
are more complicated,

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:41.218
those type of
things are actually

00:30:41.218 --> 00:30:43.420
highly constrained
by preexisting

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.494
social interactions.

00:30:45.494 --> 00:30:47.410
So in some sense, what
Granovetter was arguing

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:50.710
is that the world
has a lot of networks

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:52.411
that are formed by
sociological process,

00:30:52.411 --> 00:30:53.411
not by economic process.

00:30:53.411 --> 00:30:55.870
And these networks
predate economic activity

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:57.220
and constrain economic activity.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:00.070
So that idea of pipes through
which the economy can flow

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:02.540
are determined a priori by
other sociological processes.

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.865
And these are very simple
and obvious sociological

00:31:05.865 --> 00:31:06.815
process to anyone.

00:31:06.815 --> 00:31:07.724
The family.

00:31:07.724 --> 00:31:10.140
You don't develop a relationship
with your dad or your mom

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:13.035
because you were doing
business together.

00:31:13.035 --> 00:31:15.664
In some sense, you're
born into a family,

00:31:15.664 --> 00:31:18.880
and those are things that
are important to everyone.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.025
And also, when
you're a kid, you're

00:31:21.025 --> 00:31:22.943
put, for example, in a school.

00:31:22.943 --> 00:31:25.802
Even if the kids in that
school like you or not,

00:31:25.802 --> 00:31:27.218
and if you don't
like them or not,

00:31:27.218 --> 00:31:29.750
you basically spend so much
time with them that [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:31.041
that you get to know very well.

00:31:31.041 --> 00:31:33.720
And you're not going to get to
choose that much who you end up

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.720
becoming friends with.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:38.070
You have a lot of these
shared foci or institutions

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.910
that get passed on and
determine the people

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:42.149
that you interact with.

00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:43.523
And the friends
that you're going

00:31:43.523 --> 00:31:45.820
to be able to make
basically are determined

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.815
by that narrow set
of people that you

00:31:47.815 --> 00:31:49.690
get to interact
with through reasons

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:51.082
that you don't get to choose.

00:31:51.082 --> 00:31:53.040
You're not choosing among
seven billion people.

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:57.690
You're choosing your friends
out of a much smaller circle.

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:00.015
So obviously, this
idea that economies

00:32:00.015 --> 00:32:01.890
are embedded in preexisting
social structures

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:03.650
makes a lot of sense.

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:07.210
But Granovetter also,
he's a very good academic.

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:10.650
So he decided to basically
put this theory to the test

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:12.820
by collecting data.

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:15.470
So what data could you get to
try to understand that better?

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:15.970
So markets.

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:17.870
What he said is, I'm going
to look at the labor market.

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:19.830
The labor market is
an important market

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:23.600
in which people basically
find other people

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:27.790
that they need to grow the
organizations that they form.

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:31.090
So what he did is he
made this big survey

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:34.230
in the Newton suburb of Boston.

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:38.769
In that survey, he asked
people how they got jobs.

00:32:38.769 --> 00:32:40.810
And he realized that
basically, 50% of all people

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:44.080
got jobs through a
friend of a friend.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.400
So the preexisting
social structure

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.150
allocated 50% of the
jobs in the economy.

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:54.060
What jobs were allocated through
this preexisting social links,

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.618
the best jobs or the worst jobs?

00:32:56.618 --> 00:32:58.020
And it was the best jobs.

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:01.728
So if you're looking for a CTO,
a CFO, a talented engineer,

00:33:01.728 --> 00:33:04.310
usually a recommendation
from someone that you trust

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:09.606
is a very important way
of getting that person.

00:33:09.606 --> 00:33:11.207
You're getting
someone that is going

00:33:11.207 --> 00:33:13.840
to do a job that is
much more standardized.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.310
Usually, those jobs are
more likely to be assigned

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:20.610
through an agency or
through some sort of ad

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:22.770
in the newspaper or online.

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:25.937
And the thing is this
number is like 50%

00:33:25.937 --> 00:33:28.690
that Granovetter for the
first time in the late '60s

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:30.640
has been measured over
and over and over again

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.140
in a number of
different situations.

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:33.700
And more or less, no
matter what country

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.580
you look at, what ethnic
group you look at,

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:39.930
or what technological period
you look at, between 40% and 60%

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:45.310
of all jobs are assigned
through friends of friends.

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:49.370
Even the internet has not
been able to change that.

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:51.500
So what does this tell you?

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.377
What is happening here is that
what these people were figuring

00:33:54.377 --> 00:33:57.290
out is that they were developing
a more sophisticated theory

00:33:57.290 --> 00:34:00.076
of what these networks are.

00:34:00.076 --> 00:34:04.730
Because what social
networks embody is trust.

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:08.429
So trust is something
that is very real.

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:10.493
And trust is related to
the cost of interactions

00:34:10.493 --> 00:34:12.409
that you're going to
have with another person,

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:13.725
but also about the
expectations that you're

00:34:13.725 --> 00:34:15.516
going to have about
that person's behavior.

00:34:15.516 --> 00:34:17.981
So for example, trust
my wife or a person

00:34:17.981 --> 00:34:21.781
trusts their partner
when that person is not

00:34:21.781 --> 00:34:23.489
going to cheat on
them, even though there

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:26.810
might be a very attractive
person that is hitting on them.

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:28.929
So Granovetter's
definition of trust

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:31.482
is that you trust a
person, would that person

00:34:31.482 --> 00:34:34.500
do what is right
for you even when

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:37.270
incentives are to do
what is wrong for you.

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:40.050
So it's when people prioritize
the social relationship

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:41.536
over the short term gain.

00:34:44.802 --> 00:34:46.260
And what this is
telling us also is

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.226
that trust, which
is this concept that

00:34:47.226 --> 00:34:48.684
might appear to
get a little fuzzy,

00:34:48.684 --> 00:34:50.909
is a real thing that
needs to exist somewhere

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:54.030
because everything in the world
has to be embodied somehow

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:55.580
in our physical reality.

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:58.860
In this case, trust is
embodied on social networks.

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:03.130
Just like water goes inside
a bottle inside a cup,

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:06.846
trust only exists in the
context of a social network.

00:35:06.846 --> 00:35:08.220
Those social links
are meaningful

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:11.439
only as long as they embody
and accumulate trust.

00:35:11.439 --> 00:35:14.337
If I just know you because we
exchanged a couple of emails

00:35:14.337 --> 00:35:15.711
but I don't trust
you, that's not

00:35:15.711 --> 00:35:17.085
a meaningful social
relationship.

00:35:17.085 --> 00:35:19.029
But if I trust you,
that social relationship

00:35:19.029 --> 00:35:19.820
is very meaningful.

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.330
It's going to allow you
to do a lot of things.

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:26.300
So people like Francis Fukuyama
then take this idea of trust

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:29.810
and they start to explain what
are the different things that

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:32.470
countries are able to make
based on the level of trust

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:34.250
that they have.

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:37.470
So on the one hand, you
have low trust societies,

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:39.850
and on the other hand, you
have high trust societies.

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:42.526
And this is very much related
to the transaction cost theory

00:35:42.526 --> 00:35:44.530
that was advanced
by Coase and the New

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:47.790
Institutional Economists
in earlier decades.

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:49.956
And Fukuyama says, well,
if you have a society where

00:35:49.956 --> 00:35:52.206
you have low trust, creating
social relationships is

00:35:52.206 --> 00:35:52.830
very expensive.

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:56.058
It takes a lot of time to become
a good friend with someone.

00:35:56.058 --> 00:35:58.182
So links are expensive so
you can have few of them.

00:35:58.182 --> 00:36:00.918
So the networks that you can
form are relatively small.

00:36:00.918 --> 00:36:03.490
If you have a society that you
have high levels of trust--

00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:06.623
so I meet someone, and
after a couple of meetings

00:36:06.623 --> 00:36:08.464
we're already ready
to do business

00:36:08.464 --> 00:36:10.630
or to start a partnership
or to do a collaboration--

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:13.200
then I can have a lot of links
because links are very cheap,

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.180
and I can create large networks.

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.920
So in the low trust society,
you have small computers.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.580
And in the large trust
societies actually

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:24.414
have large [INAUDIBLE] computers
because-- for you guys,

00:36:24.414 --> 00:36:26.830
probably it's easier to think
in terms of parallelization.

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:29.224
If I have a lot of
high speed links

00:36:29.224 --> 00:36:31.515
between the different computers
that I'm parallelizing,

00:36:31.515 --> 00:36:35.510
I'm going to build a
very efficient cluster.

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:38.992
So Fukuyama divides the
world in these two extremes

00:36:38.992 --> 00:36:41.265
not because the world is
either black and white,

00:36:41.265 --> 00:36:42.640
but sometimes to
understand gray,

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.515
the best thing is to
understand what black is

00:36:44.515 --> 00:36:45.274
and what white is.

00:36:45.274 --> 00:36:47.930
And on the one hand, you
have familial societies.

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:51.390
Familial societies are the
ones in which there's no trust.

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:53.642
So when there's no
trust, people have

00:36:53.642 --> 00:36:56.315
to take advantage to the
last reservoir of trust

00:36:56.315 --> 00:36:58.106
that they have left,
and that's the family.

00:36:58.106 --> 00:36:59.098
Those are the strongest links.

00:36:59.098 --> 00:37:01.082
So in a society that
nobody trusts each other,

00:37:01.082 --> 00:37:03.015
they trust their family members.

00:37:03.015 --> 00:37:05.390
And those societies, they are
dominated by small networks

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:07.175
that are composed of kin.

00:37:07.175 --> 00:37:09.400
And these small networks
that are composed of kin

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:12.154
have a limited pool of talent.

00:37:12.154 --> 00:37:14.070
So because they have a
limited pool of talent,

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:16.343
they're going to gravitate
towards simpler industries that

00:37:16.343 --> 00:37:18.718
can be managed by a few people,
like agriculture, mining,

00:37:18.718 --> 00:37:19.464
and retail.

00:37:19.464 --> 00:37:22.330
These are societies in
which when people organize

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:27.070
themselves, they tend
to demand the government

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:28.650
to change things.

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:31.310
So people organize
themselves to protest,

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:34.582
not to create some sort of
association in which they're

00:37:34.582 --> 00:37:37.040
going to self provide what they
think that they're missing.

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.359
On high trust societies,
on the other hand, built

00:37:39.359 --> 00:37:42.015
from large networks
of non-kin-- I

00:37:42.015 --> 00:37:43.706
don't know if the
Smurfs are kin or not.

00:37:43.706 --> 00:37:45.638
I don't know if anybody does.

00:37:45.638 --> 00:37:49.620
But it's built of these
large networks of non-kin.

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:51.450
And these large
networks of non-kin

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:53.210
gravitate towards
complex entities.

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:55.300
So I assume here,
there's no brothers

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:56.467
or cousins in this room, no?

00:37:56.467 --> 00:37:57.966
No brothers or
cousins in this room?

00:37:57.966 --> 00:37:58.597
No?

00:37:58.597 --> 00:38:00.430
So they gravitate towards
complex industries

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:01.763
like aerospace, microprocessors.

00:38:01.763 --> 00:38:03.276
These are networks
that accumulate

00:38:03.276 --> 00:38:05.894
a lot of professional
talent and are also networks

00:38:05.894 --> 00:38:08.512
that sometimes self generate
these instances to accumulate

00:38:08.512 --> 00:38:09.887
the social capital
that they need

00:38:09.887 --> 00:38:13.860
through events, through
associations, and so forth.

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:16.100
So what this tells
us, though, is

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.016
that no matter what
mechanism we use

00:38:18.016 --> 00:38:20.500
to try to explain the
networks that we form,

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.440
we end up bumping into the fact
that the networks that we form

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:24.480
have a finite size.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.910
That finite size
can be determined

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:28.410
by the level of
trust that you have,

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:30.800
can be determined by
preexisting social ties,

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:34.500
or by transactional
costs that also

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.290
are mandated by technology.

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:38.790
And if you have a
finite size of networks,

00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:41.926
what you're going to have is
another quantization limit,

00:38:41.926 --> 00:38:43.980
which is what I call
the firmbyte limit.

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:46.228
So just like before,
computation needs

00:38:46.228 --> 00:38:49.189
to be distributed among
a large number of people.

00:38:49.189 --> 00:38:51.230
Because people have a
finite capacity to compute,

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:54.320
firms also have a finite
capacity to compute.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:58.138
And that means that in our
society and our economy,

00:38:58.138 --> 00:39:01.950
we have to re-quantize
these computational networks

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:03.110
of firms.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:06.260
So as we have been accumulating
knowledge and know how

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:08.485
and we have an increasing
computational capacity,

00:39:08.485 --> 00:39:10.595
we have transcended
the personbyte limit,

00:39:10.595 --> 00:39:13.076
and now for a long time have
transcended the firmbyte limit

00:39:13.076 --> 00:39:14.909
in which the products
we create are actually

00:39:14.909 --> 00:39:16.620
produced by networks of firms.

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:19.801
So as an example, think
of the personal computer.

00:39:19.801 --> 00:39:21.605
So you know a personal
computer usually

00:39:21.605 --> 00:39:26.130
tends to have some sort of brand
in its body, the parts that

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:28.140
make that computer
were obviously produced

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:31.205
by a large ecosystem of
other networks of people that

00:39:31.205 --> 00:39:32.111
were at other firms.

00:39:32.111 --> 00:39:33.760
And then that computer
is useful only as long

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.634
as you have software.

00:39:34.634 --> 00:39:36.535
And that software
is yet produced

00:39:36.535 --> 00:39:38.592
by another group of people.

00:39:38.592 --> 00:39:40.440
And you use that
software to go online.

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.023
And all of those
websites are produced

00:39:42.023 --> 00:39:44.240
by yet another group of people.

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.715
And then those websites
work-- well, why?

00:39:46.715 --> 00:39:49.100
Because people are willing
to advertise on them.

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.556
And what are the advertisements?

00:39:50.556 --> 00:39:52.472
They're advertising
products that are produced

00:39:52.472 --> 00:39:53.981
by yet another group of people.

00:39:53.981 --> 00:39:55.480
So in some sense,
we live in a world

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.814
in which we are creating
these very, very, very, long

00:39:57.814 --> 00:39:59.230
[INAUDIBLE] that
are made possible

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:01.140
as we're creating value in
the context of these networks

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:02.556
of firms that are
also facilitated

00:40:02.556 --> 00:40:05.728
by standards, by trust, by
associations, by a number

00:40:05.728 --> 00:40:09.346
of different things that allow
these large computers to come

00:40:09.346 --> 00:40:11.210
together.

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:14.690
So in some sense, we can say
that Pep Guardiola was right.

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:18.332
That what is difficult
to do when you're

00:40:18.332 --> 00:40:20.290
trying to accomplish
something, you're not just

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:22.150
figuring out what
you are going to do,

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:24.750
but you try to create
a network of people

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:27.650
that has the capacity to do it.

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:30.150
And that embodiment of knowledge
and know how in the context

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:32.950
of a social network
is what makes

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:34.765
the growth of
computation, and therefore

00:40:34.765 --> 00:40:38.470
the growth of information
inside an economy, difficult.

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:40.220
So what I want to
do next is now I'm

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:42.303
going to start bringing
in data to try to validate

00:40:42.303 --> 00:40:46.234
these theories by using several
observations that connect

00:40:46.234 --> 00:40:47.900
cultures to the
products that they make,

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:52.000
and also that look at how
communication technologies have

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.971
changed our ability to record
information and the types

00:40:55.971 --> 00:40:57.326
of information that we record.

00:40:57.326 --> 00:40:59.200
But also, I'm going to
give you guys a break,

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.159
because I think you have
heard a lot of things.

00:41:01.159 --> 00:41:02.616
So what I'm going
to do next is I'm

00:41:02.616 --> 00:41:04.410
going to show you a
very short video that

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:06.309
shows the other part
of the research agenda

00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:08.850
that I do at MIT, which is not
just the scholarly work that I

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:10.550
translate into books and papers.

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:12.620
But it's the work that
involves invention.

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:15.130
And what we have been doing
is we have been creating

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:17.575
the opposite of a database.

00:41:17.575 --> 00:41:19.985
For many years now,
there are many companies

00:41:19.985 --> 00:41:21.907
like Oracle and
SAP, and you guys

00:41:21.907 --> 00:41:23.865
as well, that have
developed great technologies

00:41:23.865 --> 00:41:26.470
to accumulate and store
vast volumes of data.

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:29.595
But in some sense,
much of that data

00:41:29.595 --> 00:41:31.880
is very obscure to the
people that own it,

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.720
or even to the people that
would want to access it.

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:38.010
Because databases are organized,
but they're not transparent.

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:39.680
So what we have been
doing is we have

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:42.624
been building what I call data
visualization engines, which

00:41:42.624 --> 00:41:44.780
are these stacks of
software that you

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:47.100
can use to point into
any part of database

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.350
and obtain not a
table as a result,

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:50.820
but obtain a visualization.

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:53.075
And then by taking
these visualizations

00:41:53.075 --> 00:41:54.450
and putting them
together, you're

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:56.600
going to start creating stories
that allow you to understand

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:58.250
the systems that
are being described

00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:01.400
and the information that
is embodied in that data.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:02.999
So I'm going to
show you that video.

00:42:02.999 --> 00:42:04.790
And then we're going
to continue by looking

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:07.520
at how we can use now
[INAUDIBLE] observations

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:10.412
to validate our results.

00:42:10.412 --> 00:42:11.388

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:35.459
-Welcome to the MIT Media
Lab Macro Connections Group.

00:42:35.459 --> 00:42:39.160
Today, we're going to show
you seven different projects.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:42.390
These are the Observatory of
Economic Complexity, DataViva,

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:49.111
Pantheon, Immersion, Place
Pulse, StreetScore, and Dive.

00:42:49.111 --> 00:42:51.740
Most of these projects are
data visualization engine.

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:54.592
That is, they're
online tools that

00:42:54.592 --> 00:42:58.528
empower people to visualize
any aspect of a data set.

00:43:09.844 --> 00:43:11.812
The Observatory of
Economic Complexity

00:43:11.812 --> 00:43:14.160
is a tool that makes
available international trade

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.900
data for the last 50
years through more than 20

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:18.873
million visualizations.

00:43:18.873 --> 00:43:21.711
The Observatory of
Economic Complexity

00:43:21.711 --> 00:43:25.495
focuses on the mix of
products that countries

00:43:25.495 --> 00:43:28.200
export because this product mix
is predictive of a country's

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.750
future patterns of
diversification, GDP

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:32.320
growth, and income inequality.

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:46.870
DataViva makes available
regional development data

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:49.320
for all of Brazil
through more than one

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:50.300
billion visualizations.

00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:00.370
These visualizations include
trade data, employment data,

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:03.767
and education data for each
of Brazil's more than 5,000

00:44:03.767 --> 00:44:06.100
municipalities and its hundreds
of products, industries,

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:06.770
and occupations.

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.960
Pantheon expands on
the ideas developed

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:36.510
in the Observatory of Economic
Complexity and DataViva

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:41.410
by focusing on historical,
cultural production.

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:43.040
Pantheon is allowing
us to achieve

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:46.435
a quantitative understanding of
our species collective memory

00:44:46.435 --> 00:44:49.450
and of the role of languages
and communication technologies

00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:52.262
in the production and diffusion
of cultural information.

00:45:19.313 --> 00:45:22.980
Immersion is a design experiment
that inverts a person's email

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:26.159
inbox by centering it on
people, rather than messages.

00:45:30.542 --> 00:45:32.250
Immersion reveals the
web of interactions

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:34.570
that people create over
long periods of time,

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:38.110
helping uncover the information
embodied in metadata,

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:40.934
but also facilitating the
study of the networks that

00:45:40.934 --> 00:45:41.725
form organizations.

00:45:58.518 --> 00:46:00.750
Place Pulse and
StreetScore are efforts

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:03.231
to create high resolution
maps of people's perceptions

00:46:03.231 --> 00:46:04.180
of urban environments.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.597
These maps have been shown to
correlate with crime levels.

00:46:09.597 --> 00:46:11.930
But also, we're now using
them to create computer vision

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:14.680
tools that help us
study urban change.

00:46:29.901 --> 00:46:31.580
Finally, Dive is an
effort to automate

00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:35.300
the creation of simple
data visualization engines.

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.330
Unlike traditional
visualization tools

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:39.940
that ask users to decide
which visualizations

00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:42.570
they want to make a priori,
Dive has the ability

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:45.483
to recommend visualizations
to users, facilitating

00:46:45.483 --> 00:46:49.570
the exploration of their data.

00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:51.775
Together, these
technologies are helping

00:46:51.775 --> 00:46:55.450
us understand the evolution
of global economies,

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:57.900
regional economies,
cultural production, cities,

00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:59.370
and organizations.

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:01.820
But unlike traditional
research methods,

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:03.739
these tools help
us include millions

00:47:03.739 --> 00:47:05.822
of people in the exploration
of the knowledge that

00:47:05.822 --> 00:47:06.960
is hidden in our data.

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:09.460
Join us in our quest.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:47:46.558 --> 00:47:48.016
CESAR HIDALGO: That
gives you a bit

00:47:48.016 --> 00:47:49.944
of a taste of some
of the other things

00:47:49.944 --> 00:47:51.494
that we do in my
lab, which is is we

00:47:51.494 --> 00:47:53.410
create these large data
visualization engines.

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:56.310
We've created some
that are very specific,

00:47:56.310 --> 00:47:59.410
for example, the ones that are
looking at international trade

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:03.040
data, some that are growing to
become less specific and more

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:03.700
general.

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:05.725
For instance, DataViva
started looking only

00:48:05.725 --> 00:48:07.080
at industrial data for Brazil.

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:08.905
Now it also includes
location data,

00:48:08.905 --> 00:48:10.640
and we're even
looking to incorporate

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:14.410
even environmental
data in the future.

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:15.957
So what I want to
do next is I want

00:48:15.957 --> 00:48:18.290
to validate some of the
theories that I told you before.

00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:20.812
This is the idea that
economies are computers

00:48:20.812 --> 00:48:23.623
and that the computational
capacity of these computers

00:48:23.623 --> 00:48:26.170
is determined by their ability
to form networks that they

00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:28.163
can use to model computation.

00:48:28.163 --> 00:48:30.680
And that eventually,
we can use this theory

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:34.800
to explain differences in
income and economic growth.

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:36.550
And to be able to
validate those theories,

00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:38.758
I first have to make sure
that we're on the same page

00:48:38.758 --> 00:48:42.440
according to a very
important relationship, which

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.970
is the relationship within
genotypes and phenotypes.

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:48.310
So a genotype is the information
that is encoded in your genes.

00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:51.060
A phenotype is a trait
that is observable

00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:53.200
to an external observer.

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.820
So in principle, obviously,
you can genotype people

00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:59.370
by sequencing, but
sequencing is kind of hard.

00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:02.010
And also, figuring out
what genes are associated

00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:05.040
to which traits is kind of
difficult. So in some sense,

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:06.640
one thing that we
can do is let's say

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:11.080
I'm curious about the genes
that encode for height.

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:14.615
And I have two people, Danny
DeVito and LeBron James.

00:49:14.615 --> 00:49:16.925
Obviously, one
cumbersome way of trying

00:49:16.925 --> 00:49:19.174
to figure out who has the
genes that encode for height

00:49:19.174 --> 00:49:20.517
would be to sequence
them and try

00:49:20.517 --> 00:49:23.058
to figure out what are the many
genes that encode for height.

00:49:23.058 --> 00:49:25.930
There are known to be more or
less more than 10 genes maybe

00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:27.450
that encode height.

00:49:27.450 --> 00:49:30.362
Or the other thing is I can just
look at Danny DeVito and LeBron

00:49:30.362 --> 00:49:31.780
James and say, hey,
probably LeBron James

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:33.321
has genes that encode
for being tall,

00:49:33.321 --> 00:49:35.674
and Danny DeVito doesn't
have those genes.

00:49:35.674 --> 00:49:38.866
So in some sense, even if I
don't have a technology that

00:49:38.866 --> 00:49:40.486
allows me to look
at the genotypes,

00:49:40.486 --> 00:49:42.236
I can know a lot about
a person's genotype

00:49:42.236 --> 00:49:43.238
by looking at their
phenotype because

00:49:43.238 --> 00:49:45.010
of the genotype-phenotype
relationship.

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:49.718
By the same token, economies are
computers that run on knowledge

00:49:49.718 --> 00:49:50.559
and know how.

00:49:50.559 --> 00:49:52.850
And measuring knowledge and
know how is very difficult.

00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:54.475
So I can look at
knowledge and know how

00:49:54.475 --> 00:49:57.970
by looking at the products
that economies make.

00:49:57.970 --> 00:50:00.702
So if an economy produces
cars and produces good cars,

00:50:00.702 --> 00:50:02.740
I know something about
the fact that they

00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:05.630
know how to shape metal and
they have mechanical engineers.

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:07.546
In a company like Google,
I know that you guys

00:50:07.546 --> 00:50:10.060
know how to deal with data
and to build websites.

00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:12.436
In a company like Apple,
I know that they're

00:50:12.436 --> 00:50:14.310
very good at consumer
products and the design

00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:15.610
of those products.

00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:18.255
So in some way, what
I want to do now

00:50:18.255 --> 00:50:20.440
is I want to look at
the mix of products

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:22.650
that a country or a
region makes as a way

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:24.752
to try to understand
the type of knowledge

00:50:24.752 --> 00:50:26.153
and know how that they have.

00:50:26.153 --> 00:50:28.038
I'm going to in some
way measure the capacity

00:50:28.038 --> 00:50:31.050
of a computer
based on the output

00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:34.510
that it's able to produce.

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:37.110
So I'm going to look
at a number of facts

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:39.545
because obviously,
no rope of evidence

00:50:39.545 --> 00:50:41.114
is built on a single strand.

00:50:41.114 --> 00:50:43.650
And the first fact that
I'm going to look at

00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:45.950
is at the structure of
the network that connects

00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:47.640
industries to locations.

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:49.480
So here on the left,
I have a network

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.580
that connects municipalities
and industries.

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:53.520
These are all
municipalities in Chile.

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.570
On the right, I have
a network that's

00:50:55.570 --> 00:50:57.820
connecting countries to the
products that they export.

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:00.710
A black dot represents
a link, meaning

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:04.320
that an industry is present in
that municipality or a product

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:06.307
is being exported
by that country.

00:51:06.307 --> 00:51:08.140
And these matrices are
not sorted at random.

00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:10.570
On the top, I put the most
diverse municipalities

00:51:10.570 --> 00:51:12.070
or the most diverse countries.

00:51:12.070 --> 00:51:15.937
And on the left, I put the
most ubiquitous industries,

00:51:15.937 --> 00:51:17.770
the ones that are present
in most locations,

00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:19.673
or the most ubiquitous
products, the ones

00:51:19.673 --> 00:51:21.890
that are exported by the
largest number of countries.

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:24.120
And what you see is that
this matrix is nested.

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:27.540
Nestedness is a
pattern that was first

00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:31.000
discovered by an ecologist
looking at insular habitats.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.220
If you have islands
of increasing size,

00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:35.894
the ecosystems of those
islands become more diverse,

00:51:35.894 --> 00:51:38.560
but it also becomes more diverse
in discovering nested patterns.

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:41.160
Because I think that is--
islands of increasing size

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:44.940
are also more sophisticated
ecological computers.

00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:46.760
And what this
nested pattern tells

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:49.034
you is that where the places
that produce few things,

00:51:49.034 --> 00:51:50.950
they don't produce a
random set of few things.

00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:52.575
They produce subsets
of the things that

00:51:52.575 --> 00:51:54.036
are produced by more places.

00:51:54.036 --> 00:51:55.966
And they produce
subsets of the ones that

00:51:55.966 --> 00:51:57.492
are produced by more places.

00:51:57.492 --> 00:51:59.031
This is not a
[INAUDIBLE] matrix,

00:51:59.031 --> 00:52:00.280
but it's like a nested matrix.

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:01.770
They are subsets.

00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:04.475
And this nestedness is at first
strand in the rope of evidence

00:52:04.475 --> 00:52:07.121
because it tells you, well, the
places that are little diverse

00:52:07.121 --> 00:52:08.620
are places, obviously,
that can only

00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:10.525
form relatively
small networks that

00:52:10.525 --> 00:52:11.930
are unsophisticated computers.

00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:14.014
And the places that
are more diverse,

00:52:14.014 --> 00:52:16.442
they can produce large
networks that are

00:52:16.442 --> 00:52:17.650
more sophisticated computers.

00:52:17.650 --> 00:52:20.260
And they can produce
the things that

00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:22.010
are done by the
unsophisticated computers,

00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:25.000
but also the ones
that are done only

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.230
in a sophisticated computer.

00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:30.230
So if you think about it,
think of an Atari 2600.

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:31.822
An Atari 2600 by
today's standards

00:52:31.822 --> 00:52:33.280
is a very
unsophisticated computer.

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:36.244
And you can run Pac-Man on it.

00:52:36.244 --> 00:52:38.220
Now, on my Mac, I
can also run Pac-Man,

00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:41.690
but I can run things that I
cannot run on an Atari 2600.

00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:43.360
So in some sense, the
more sophisticated

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:44.860
the computer, the
more diverse it's

00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:47.364
going to be able
to have as input.

00:52:47.364 --> 00:52:49.280
But also, it's going be
able to produce inputs

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:51.660
that are very rare,
that it would only

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:54.585
be able to produce in very
sophisticated computers.

00:52:54.585 --> 00:52:56.710
So that's the first strand
in the rope of evidence.

00:52:56.710 --> 00:53:00.430
The second strand goes
into ideas of learning.

00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:05.010
So according to some computers,
just like you, me, and cells,

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:09.340
and computers, in some
way, they need to learn.

00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:10.885
Sometimes, the way
that computers is

00:53:10.885 --> 00:53:12.290
that we don't let them learn.

00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:14.980
We just tell them what to do.

00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:16.741
But someone has to
do the learning.

00:53:16.741 --> 00:53:19.974
And economies as computers, they
learn at this collective level.

00:53:19.974 --> 00:53:22.015
And what happens is that
one property of learning

00:53:22.015 --> 00:53:23.597
is that it's always
easier to learn

00:53:23.597 --> 00:53:25.180
something that is
similar to something

00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:27.640
that you already know.

00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:29.820
So if I know Spanish, it's
relatively easy for me

00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:32.760
to learn Portuguese and it's
hard for me to learn Chinese,

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:38.207
not because Portuguese might be
inherently easier than Chinese,

00:53:38.207 --> 00:53:39.804
but simply because
I have knowledge

00:53:39.804 --> 00:53:41.470
that is very similar
and very redundant.

00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:42.915
A lot of words I
can simply reuse.

00:53:42.915 --> 00:53:44.915
A lot of grammar I can
simply reuse from Spanish

00:53:44.915 --> 00:53:46.956
to Portuguese, but I cannot
reuse it from Spanish

00:53:46.956 --> 00:53:48.500
to Chinese.

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:51.266
And economies is some
way do the same thing.

00:53:51.266 --> 00:53:54.284
So they diversity towards
related varieties.

00:53:54.284 --> 00:53:56.575
What that means is that if
you know the mix of products

00:53:56.575 --> 00:53:58.850
that a country makes, you
can very accurately predict

00:53:58.850 --> 00:54:01.330
the mix of products that
it's going to make next.

00:54:01.330 --> 00:54:03.970
So here, I have a picture of the
product space for Chile, 1979.

00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:07.500
So what does this picture mean?

00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:12.070
Each dot represents a product,
and the dots that are painted

00:54:12.070 --> 00:54:14.730
are the products that Chile
exported in the year 1979.

00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:16.575
The ones that are
gray, like fresh fish,

00:54:16.575 --> 00:54:20.530
are products that Chile did
not export in that year.

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:21.840
Now we have links.

00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:24.060
The links are proportional
to the property

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.942
that two products
are co-exported.

00:54:25.942 --> 00:54:27.900
So if I know that two
products are co-exported,

00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:29.896
I know that they must
be kind of similar.

00:54:29.896 --> 00:54:31.270
Because I know
that, for example,

00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:32.936
the countries that
export preserved fish

00:54:32.936 --> 00:54:34.350
tend to export fresh fish.

00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:36.180
I can predict that
since Chile already

00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:38.470
knows how to export
preserved fish, crustaceans,

00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:41.120
and mollusks, and
frozen fish, they

00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:43.810
might become good at exporting
fresh fish in the future.

00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:46.520
By the same token, if I go to
this other part of the product

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:50.770
space and I look at, say, parts
of metalworking machine tools,

00:54:50.770 --> 00:54:54.830
that's a product that Chile
is not producing anything

00:54:54.830 --> 00:54:56.638
that is related to that.

00:54:56.638 --> 00:54:58.660
So learning how to
produce that product

00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:00.910
would be very difficult
because we have nothing

00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:03.322
that we could reuse.

00:55:03.322 --> 00:55:05.030
So now I'm going to
fast forward in time.

00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:09.970
So we're in 1979 and I'm
going to go to the year 1996.

00:55:09.970 --> 00:55:12.590
If I go to the year 1996, I
see that Chile now also exports

00:55:12.590 --> 00:55:15.676
fresh fish and also
exports frozen fish filets

00:55:15.676 --> 00:55:17.260
that they didn't export before.

00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:20.200
And they diversified in this
part of the product space that

00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:21.690
was the part of
the product space

00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:24.834
that was close to the part
that they were already in.

00:55:24.834 --> 00:55:27.204
And this is something that
is actually true in general.

00:55:27.204 --> 00:55:29.329
You guys probably here are
familiar with ROC curves

00:55:29.329 --> 00:55:31.060
when you're doing a
prediction algorithm.

00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:33.270
The product space has
a [INAUDIBLE] of 0.5

00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:34.290
in an ROC curve.

00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:35.660
You're trying to predict
the mix of products

00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:37.201
that a country is
going to make next.

00:55:37.201 --> 00:55:39.971
So this is actually quite
accurate at predicting

00:55:39.971 --> 00:55:41.570
the mix of products
that a country

00:55:41.570 --> 00:55:42.260
is going to make in the future.

00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:44.270
Obviously, there's a
shitload of false positives,

00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:45.575
too, because the process
of diversification

00:55:45.575 --> 00:55:46.825
has very future positives.

00:55:46.825 --> 00:55:49.960
But ROC curves are
still very good.

00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:53.880
So the second string
on our rope of evidence

00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:56.330
is the fact that
economies learn by moving

00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:59.403
into related varieties.

00:55:59.403 --> 00:56:01.236
The third string relates
to economic growth.

00:56:01.236 --> 00:56:03.170
And the idea of economic
growth is an old idea

00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:07.050
that we can say started
with a Scotsman, Adam Smith.

00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:08.510
And he conceptualized
the economy

00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:11.060
in terms of two things,
capital and labor.

00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:11.960
Labor were people.

00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.380
Capital were things
that people did.

00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:17.260
And then people saved the things
that they did to produce things

00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:17.940
in the future.

00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:19.773
And those ideas were
eventually mathematized

00:56:19.773 --> 00:56:21.540
by Robert Solow in the 1950s.

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:23.998
And what happened is that when
Solow advanced these models,

00:56:23.998 --> 00:56:25.750
there was a big
gap that was left.

00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:30.344
That gap was between the
model and the empirical data.

00:56:30.344 --> 00:56:31.885
And that gap
eventually, other people

00:56:31.885 --> 00:56:35.965
tried to explain it by using
information on other factors

00:56:35.965 --> 00:56:38.390
that they thought that
Solow had left out.

00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:40.650
So for instance, in
the '80s and '90s,

00:56:40.650 --> 00:56:43.808
people like [? Robert ?]
Mankiw and Paul [? Robert ?]

00:56:43.808 --> 00:56:46.550
started to introduce the
idea of human capital.

00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:47.950
It's not just people and things.

00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:50.210
People have to know things also.

00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:53.410
And then people in
the '90s and 2000s,

00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:55.370
they started to
include social capital.

00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:57.000
People might know things,
but if they're all assholes

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.570
and they don't
talk to each other

00:56:58.570 --> 00:57:01.360
and they don't get
along well, eventually,

00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:04.390
what's going to happen is
that that's not going to work.

00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:06.410
So people need to come together.

00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:07.910
And social capital
is another factor

00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:09.200
that was not being accounted.

00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:10.699
And when they
included human capital

00:57:10.699 --> 00:57:12.285
and they included
social capital,

00:57:12.285 --> 00:57:14.354
the gap that Solow
had left behind

00:57:14.354 --> 00:57:16.210
started to shrink a little bit.

00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:18.530
The models were doing
better and better.

00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:21.450
But also, now that we understand
that economies are computers,

00:57:21.450 --> 00:57:23.299
we can try to reinterpret
all of these ideas

00:57:23.299 --> 00:57:24.840
and try to see if
there was something

00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:27.070
that is still missing.

00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:30.250
So now, within that we
have two firms here.

00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:33.270
We can start to reinterpret
all of these factors

00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:35.400
in terms of the [INAUDIBLE]
that I've introduced.

00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:37.140
On the one hand,
firms produce things.

00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:39.610
And I think that this is
physical capital or crystals

00:57:39.610 --> 00:57:41.920
of imagination.

00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:43.830
On the other hand, we
can think that people

00:57:43.830 --> 00:57:46.980
need to know things,
and that's engineered

00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:48.696
knowledge or human capital.

00:57:48.696 --> 00:57:50.566
People need to
collect, and that's

00:57:50.566 --> 00:57:52.350
social capital and trust.

00:57:52.350 --> 00:57:54.350
But what is missing
from this picture

00:57:54.350 --> 00:57:56.400
is something else,
which is the knowledge

00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:58.400
and know how that the
systems accumulate

00:57:58.400 --> 00:57:59.674
at the collective level.

00:57:59.674 --> 00:58:01.340
And that is different
than the knowledge

00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:03.589
and know how that people
have at the individual level.

00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:05.315
And that's what is missing.

00:58:05.315 --> 00:58:08.485
But we can figure
out what societies

00:58:08.485 --> 00:58:10.410
or what economies
have accumulated

00:58:10.410 --> 00:58:11.994
vast amounts of
knowledge and know how

00:58:11.994 --> 00:58:14.368
at the collective level by
looking at the mix of products

00:58:14.368 --> 00:58:17.640
that they make, and that's what
I call learning complexity.

00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:19.250
So using the information
on the matrix

00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:20.980
that I've got of
countries and products,

00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:23.769
and taking some [INAUDIBLE]
measures out of it,

00:58:23.769 --> 00:58:26.310
we can actually create measures
of the computational capacity

00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:27.540
of economies.

00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:31.116
And these measures are not only
highly correlated with income

00:58:31.116 --> 00:58:33.490
per capita, but the deviations
between these correlations

00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:36.186
are predictors of
future economic growth.

00:58:36.186 --> 00:58:37.727
So for example, a
country like China,

00:58:37.727 --> 00:58:40.463
that you would see
down here, is a country

00:58:40.463 --> 00:58:43.160
that in 1985 had a
computational capacity that

00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:45.980
was much larger than what would
be expected by its income.

00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:47.055
So it was doomed to grow.

00:58:47.055 --> 00:58:49.835
A country like Greece had
an income that was too high,

00:58:49.835 --> 00:58:51.210
given its
computational capacity,

00:58:51.210 --> 00:58:53.001
so it was going to have
problems sustaining

00:58:53.001 --> 00:58:54.792
that level of income.

00:58:54.792 --> 00:58:58.161
So actually, when we think
about economies as computers,

00:58:58.161 --> 00:59:00.660
we realize that the level of
income that an economy achieves

00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:04.260
tends to converge to the
computational capacity.

00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:06.650
Moreover, actually,
economic complexity

00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:08.548
is a very good
explanatory factor

00:59:08.548 --> 00:59:10.770
when you're trying to
explain income inequality.

00:59:10.770 --> 00:59:12.470
Just to go very
briefly here, if you

00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:14.220
take two countries
like Chile and Malaysia

00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:16.921
that have basically the
same level of income

00:59:16.921 --> 00:59:19.450
and the same level of
education, if you want

00:59:19.450 --> 00:59:22.270
to try to explain why Chile
is more unequal than Malaysia,

00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:23.980
you can explain that
very well if you

00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:26.153
look at the mix of
products that Chile makes

00:59:26.153 --> 00:59:27.944
vis a vis the products
that Malaysia makes.

00:59:27.944 --> 00:59:30.610
And this is because the mix of
products that a country makes

00:59:30.610 --> 00:59:33.000
tend to co-evolve
with the institutions.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.110
So imagine you were
trying to run Google

00:59:35.110 --> 00:59:38.590
as people used to run tobacco
plantations in the 1700s.

00:59:38.590 --> 00:59:42.140
Probably, it would not work
because those were companies

00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:45.715
that had very exploitative
institutions that did not

00:59:45.715 --> 00:59:47.255
consider ways in
which they could

00:59:47.255 --> 00:59:49.213
incorporate the knowledge,
know how, creativity

00:59:49.213 --> 00:59:50.270
of their workers.

00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:52.180
But for the tobacco
industry, in some sense,

00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:54.845
that kind of worked because
it was a very simple industry.

00:59:54.845 --> 00:59:56.340
Now when you have
something that is much more

00:59:56.340 --> 00:59:57.820
complex in which you
have to include people,

00:59:57.820 --> 01:00:00.465
eventually, you have to discover
the institutions that can

01:00:00.465 --> 01:00:02.450
make your company productive.

01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:04.325
And those institutions
for complex industries

01:00:04.325 --> 01:00:07.570
tend to be institutions
that are very inclusive.

01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:11.165
So the way that we behave
also is shaped and co-evolves

01:00:11.165 --> 01:00:15.730
with the type of
things that we do.

01:00:15.730 --> 01:00:20.025
I'm going to skip this part,
even though it's so nice.

01:00:20.025 --> 01:00:22.169
So another thing that
we can use to try

01:00:22.169 --> 01:00:24.460
to understand the computational
capacities of economies

01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:26.418
and systems is not by
looking only at products,

01:00:26.418 --> 01:00:28.390
but by looking at
cultural production.

01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:31.545
Because you can think of
the United States as a place

01:00:31.545 --> 01:00:34.385
that exports soybeans
and cars and jet engines,

01:00:34.385 --> 01:00:36.169
or you can think of
the United States

01:00:36.169 --> 01:00:38.335
as the birthplace of Miles
Davis and Neil Armstrong.

01:00:38.335 --> 01:00:40.740
And in some way, that
second description,

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:44.272
I would say, is very
important and is very valid.

01:00:44.272 --> 01:00:45.980
So what we started
doing a few years ago,

01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:48.420
we started to collect data
on cultural production

01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:52.420
to try to understand the rate
at which our society remembers

01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:55.255
things and the types of
things that we remember,

01:00:55.255 --> 01:00:57.120
and how those are
affected by technology.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.850
So here, what we have is two
charts with two different data

01:00:58.850 --> 01:00:59.349
sets.

01:00:59.349 --> 01:01:01.230
The one on the top is
the Pantheon data set,

01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:03.606
and this is data that
includes every person that

01:01:03.606 --> 01:01:06.118
has a presence in more
than 25 different languages

01:01:06.118 --> 01:01:07.755
in Wikipedia.

01:01:07.755 --> 01:01:10.270
So you have to be
famous in 25 languages.

01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:13.150
You have to be globally famous
to be part of that data set.

01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:15.715
And what we see on the
y-axis is the probability

01:01:15.715 --> 01:01:17.650
that one of these
globally famous people

01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:20.770
was born in a year as a
fraction of the population

01:01:20.770 --> 01:01:23.010
of the world in that year.

01:01:23.010 --> 01:01:27.230
And you see that basically,
that line jiggles

01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:31.270
in what is statistically
proven Gaussian noise

01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:33.210
until the printing
press comes along.

01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:35.220
And then there's a
discontinuity and it jumps,

01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:36.619
and it goes to another state.

01:01:36.619 --> 01:01:38.702
And then the Industrial
Revolution comes, and then

01:01:38.702 --> 01:01:41.100
it jumps again, and
it keeps on jumping.

01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:43.000
Now, this the Human
Accomplishment Data Set,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.620
which is a compendium of 4,000
historically famous biographies

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:48.190
published in the year 2003.

01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:51.680
It's a much smaller data set,
but we find the same pattern

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:53.133
and the same transition points.

01:01:53.133 --> 01:01:56.031
And what this is telling us is
that changes in communication

01:01:56.031 --> 01:01:58.790
technology are changing the
capacity of our computer

01:01:58.790 --> 01:02:01.180
to remember collectively.

01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:03.650
Before writing, we all
remembered nothing.

01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:06.450
Nobody knows the name of anybody
that was born 20,000 years ago.

01:02:06.450 --> 01:02:08.720
Then with the
invention of writing,

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.440
we started to record
some information.

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.120
And then with the
invention of printing,

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.429
the amount of information
that we were able to record

01:02:14.429 --> 01:02:15.220
started to explode.

01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:17.120
And now with modern [INAUDIBLE]
technology, obviously,

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.100
we have moved from a
world in which history

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:22.740
used to be something that was
reserved only for the elite

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:25.240
to a world in which everyone
has a personal history hidden

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:30.180
in the metadata that you guys
and other companies also have.

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:32.680
Also, [INAUDIBLE] technology
changed the type of information

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:34.980
that we produce.

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:37.280
So if you look at the era
of writing, pre-printing,

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.995
you will see that most
of the famous people that

01:02:39.995 --> 01:02:42.370
are recorded in our data set
are either political figures

01:02:42.370 --> 01:02:44.140
or religious figures.

01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:45.830
But when the printing
press comes along,

01:02:45.830 --> 01:02:48.246
these measures of cultural
production change dramatically.

01:02:48.246 --> 01:02:51.220
And now you have famous
scientists and famous artists

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:54.067
that become globally provocative
because the printing press did

01:02:54.067 --> 01:02:56.200
not only change the number
of books that produce.

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:58.199
But it also changed what
those books were about.

01:02:58.199 --> 01:02:59.696
And if you're
interested in that,

01:02:59.696 --> 01:03:02.330
the best reference there is
Elizabeth Eisenstein's "The

01:03:02.330 --> 01:03:05.900
Printing Press as
an Agent of Change."

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:08.934
But the printing press obviously
was not the last revolution.

01:03:08.934 --> 01:03:10.600
When film and radio
came along, the arts

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:11.970
shifted dramatically
because what

01:03:11.970 --> 01:03:14.344
happened is that the arts
transformed into something that

01:03:14.344 --> 01:03:17.425
was about performance, not about
the creation of pieces anymore.

01:03:17.425 --> 01:03:20.388
So before film and radio,
the ones that become famous

01:03:20.388 --> 01:03:22.239
was the painter or the composer.

01:03:22.239 --> 01:03:23.822
After the invention
of film and radio,

01:03:23.822 --> 01:03:26.200
it's the actor, the
musician, the singer

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.040
because the new medium
that was invented there

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:32.520
recorded the performance,
and that changed [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:34.650
And then when
television comes along,

01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:37.288
now you invent the
famous sports figure.

01:03:37.288 --> 01:03:40.250
[INAUDIBLE] these things are
causal because obviously,

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:42.375
for instance, if you look
at the ability of actors,

01:03:42.375 --> 01:03:44.380
there were actors at
the times of the Greeks,

01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:45.165
and there were
actors, obviously,

01:03:45.165 --> 01:03:47.450
at the time of Shakespeare
that interpret and perform

01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:48.374
his plays.

01:03:48.374 --> 01:03:49.915
But the actors were
not the ones that

01:03:49.915 --> 01:03:51.039
became famous at that time.

01:03:51.039 --> 01:03:53.200
They were the playwrights
until we developed

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.782
a medium in which
the performance was

01:03:55.782 --> 01:03:57.551
the one that was recorded.

01:03:57.551 --> 01:03:59.550
So I started by telling
you that the universe is

01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:03.364
made of three things, energy,
matter, and information,

01:04:03.364 --> 01:04:05.280
and that information
is the one that

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:06.717
makes the universe interesting.

01:04:06.717 --> 01:04:10.116
Information endows the universe
with its structure, its beauty,

01:04:10.116 --> 01:04:12.080
and its complexity.

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:14.019
I argue that there's
three mechanisms that

01:04:14.019 --> 01:04:16.310
help us explain the existence
and growth of information

01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:18.458
despite the second
law of thermodynamics.

01:04:18.458 --> 01:04:21.222
The first one is that
information is not free.

01:04:21.222 --> 01:04:23.430
You need to spend some energy
to produce information.

01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:25.590
The second one is
that you need to have

01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:28.052
ways to store that
information, and solids are

01:04:28.052 --> 01:04:29.669
an excellent way of doing it.

01:04:29.669 --> 01:04:32.740
And finally, matter needs
to develop this capacity

01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:33.471
to compute.

01:04:33.471 --> 01:04:34.970
And this capacity
to compute is what

01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:36.335
is most important
because it's what

01:04:36.335 --> 01:04:37.918
make the growth of
knowledge possible,

01:04:37.918 --> 01:04:41.435
but also what makes it difficult
because computation always

01:04:41.435 --> 01:04:43.900
needs to be physically
embodied, and the systems

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:48.020
that embody computation are
always of finite capacity.

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:50.100
And the only way that
those systems transcend

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:55.800
that finite capacity
is by actually creating

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.630
social structures
that allow them

01:04:57.630 --> 01:05:01.184
to act as parallel
computers, as computers

01:05:01.184 --> 01:05:03.600
that are able to process things
socially and collectively.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.540
So the cell transcends its
limitation by multicellularity.

01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:08.380
And multicellularity
eventually takes

01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:10.116
us all the way to the human.

01:05:10.116 --> 01:05:11.810
But then the human
is also limited.

01:05:11.810 --> 01:05:14.622
In order for us to increase
our computational capacities

01:05:14.622 --> 01:05:16.746
and make information grow,
we have to create teams,

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:18.435
we have to create
firms, and we have

01:05:18.435 --> 01:05:20.430
to create networks
of [INAUDIBLE], which

01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:23.072
are increasingly larger
social and economic computers

01:05:23.072 --> 01:05:26.940
that help push the
growth of information

01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:28.410
to what we have until today.

01:05:28.410 --> 01:05:30.660
And obviously, it will
keep on pushing the growth

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:31.870
of information in the future.

01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:33.870
And with that, I
would like to thank

01:05:33.870 --> 01:05:35.570
you very much for
your time and I'm

01:05:35.570 --> 01:05:36.732
happy to take any
questions you might have.

01:05:36.732 --> 01:05:37.232
Thank you.

01:05:37.232 --> 01:05:39.192
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:58.872 --> 01:06:00.860
AUDIENCE: I have one.

01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:06.050
I was thinking about how you
would apply it practically

01:06:06.050 --> 01:06:08.679
if you were trying to get
companies to grow or to get

01:06:08.679 --> 01:06:09.501
cities to grow.

01:06:09.501 --> 01:06:12.129
Is there a way-- are
there some specific,

01:06:12.129 --> 01:06:14.457
but are there
generalizations that you

01:06:14.457 --> 01:06:16.620
can apply to
companies or to cities

01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:19.735
to help them achieve more than
they have done [INAUDIBLE],

01:06:19.735 --> 01:06:22.109
or does it still have to be
a very specific, case by case

01:06:22.109 --> 01:06:22.940
basis?

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:24.716
CESAR HIDALGO: So the
more practical side

01:06:24.716 --> 01:06:27.869
that I've been
doing, obviously, I

01:06:27.869 --> 01:06:29.410
think that there
are some things that

01:06:29.410 --> 01:06:31.360
are scholarly work that allow
you to understand the world.

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.568
And there are things that
have an immediate practical

01:06:33.568 --> 01:06:35.770
application that you
can do in the short run

01:06:35.770 --> 01:06:37.770
and allow people
to have benefits.

01:06:37.770 --> 01:06:40.270
So for example, the Data
Visualization Engines

01:06:40.270 --> 01:06:40.930
that we are building
are becoming

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:42.471
of increasing interest
of governments

01:06:42.471 --> 01:06:46.740
beyond Brazil because these
data visualization engines allow

01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:50.130
them to facilitate data tasks
that they had to perform

01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:52.650
in the past very manually by
sending emails among people

01:06:52.650 --> 01:06:56.205
and by producing charts in
Excel and then pasting them

01:06:56.205 --> 01:06:57.580
in PowerPoint.

01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:00.560
That is useful for
them to be able to do

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:04.780
automatically and faster and
with better designed tools.

01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:07.640
So in the short run,
that's one of the things

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:09.990
that I can provide
that is a quick win

01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:13.202
and I can have implemented in
the period of a year or so.

01:07:13.202 --> 01:07:14.785
In the long run,
what this is starting

01:07:14.785 --> 01:07:18.430
to tell you is that eventually,
if you think that economies are

01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:20.230
computers, you have to
think about the ways

01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:22.165
in which you allow people
to actually connect,

01:07:22.165 --> 01:07:24.110
and how there might
be interaction

01:07:24.110 --> 01:07:27.775
between social policies
and economic prosperity.

01:07:27.775 --> 01:07:29.400
So for instance, in
the past, we tended

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:32.775
to have institutions that
were very discriminatory that

01:07:32.775 --> 01:07:35.620
limit our ability to perform
connections between people

01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:38.350
from different ethnicities,
from different nationalities,

01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:40.715
from different genders.

01:07:40.715 --> 01:07:43.484
And those policies, we would
say they were hurting us.

01:07:43.484 --> 01:07:45.900
And it's good that we're moving
in this opposite direction

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:50.950
because that helps increase
computational capacity that

01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:54.210
helps information grow, and
eventually economies grow.

01:07:54.210 --> 01:07:57.300
Also, you have these very
simple and very obvious

01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:00.170
policy applications, but
that can be derived easily

01:08:00.170 --> 01:08:03.320
from the fact that economies
are computers that are embodied

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:04.170
on social networks.

01:08:08.508 --> 01:08:10.918
AUDIENCE: On your
economic complexity chart,

01:08:10.918 --> 01:08:11.882
you have countries.

01:08:11.882 --> 01:08:13.328
Could you apply
that to companies

01:08:13.328 --> 01:08:15.720
as well, where companies
might diversify?

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:18.920
CESAR HIDALGO: So that's a good
question because in some sense,

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:22.279
as you have this
re-quantization of computation,

01:08:22.279 --> 01:08:24.090
you're going to
have matrices that

01:08:24.090 --> 01:08:26.090
have different
structure along the way.

01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:28.584
So for instance, if you
think about a country,

01:08:28.584 --> 01:08:30.239
a country is a very
large computer.

01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:32.540
It's a very large unit that
includes lots of people.

01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:36.000
It includes networks of firms
and organizations and so forth.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.137
In that case, the push is
going to be towards diversity.

01:08:39.137 --> 01:08:41.095
But if you start looking
at simpler and simpler

01:08:41.095 --> 01:08:43.220
and simpler, smaller
computers and smaller systems,

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:45.479
then the finite size
of those systems

01:08:45.479 --> 01:08:47.370
pushes towards specialization.

01:08:47.370 --> 01:08:51.019
So if I look at a company, like
Google doesn't do everything.

01:08:51.019 --> 01:08:53.685
And they shouldn't do everything
because there's a lot of things

01:08:53.685 --> 01:08:54.880
that you guys are good at,
and there's other things

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.130
that you guys are not good at.

01:08:56.130 --> 01:08:58.510
So in some sense, you might
want to stay out of things

01:08:58.510 --> 01:08:59.790
that you're not good at
and focus on the things

01:08:59.790 --> 01:09:01.050
that you're good at,
and maybe discover

01:09:01.050 --> 01:09:03.479
new things that you might
be good at that leverage

01:09:03.479 --> 01:09:04.830
your capacities.

01:09:04.830 --> 01:09:07.859
So in that case, the
measures, I would say,

01:09:07.859 --> 01:09:11.120
do not apply immediately.

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.760
But I don't think
that it would be

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:15.985
impossible to create measures
that would take that data

01:09:15.985 --> 01:09:19.223
and would be inspired by this
idea of economic complexity

01:09:19.223 --> 01:09:20.639
and computation
to create measures

01:09:20.639 --> 01:09:22.270
of the capacities of firms.

01:09:30.617 --> 01:09:32.581
AUDIENCE: I guess
another similar question.

01:09:32.581 --> 01:09:36.000
I was thinking if you tend
to maybe think strategies

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:42.504
that countries have adopted
to enable themselves to grow

01:09:42.504 --> 01:09:46.345
as computers, as in the
amount of information

01:09:46.345 --> 01:09:47.094
that they produce.

01:09:47.094 --> 01:09:49.198
Because obviously, a
company might [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:49.198 --> 01:09:52.446
diversification
because [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:52.446 --> 01:09:56.790
But have there been any
other ways in which countries

01:09:56.790 --> 01:10:00.480
have tried to diversify
their production of goods

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:05.620
or historically proven
ways that-- again,

01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:09.340
things that they haven't been
doing well they start to do.

01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:11.800
I guess that's pretty much it.

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:14.970
Or is one of the components that
were presented that contributes

01:10:14.970 --> 01:10:16.470
towards the
potential information

01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:18.960
growth in a country,
if one of them

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.344
is easier to modify than others.

01:10:20.344 --> 01:10:24.290
Because obviously, for
example, social links,

01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:26.450
predefined social links
like family connections

01:10:26.450 --> 01:10:28.130
are not easy to
modify, like you said.

01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:28.850
CESAR HIDALGO:
And in most cases,

01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:31.016
obviously, one thing is
that you understand society.

01:10:31.016 --> 01:10:33.601
Another thing is that
you can engineer it.

01:10:33.601 --> 01:10:35.272
The same is true,
for instance, if you

01:10:35.272 --> 01:10:36.980
think about Darwin's
theory of evolution.

01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:40.140
You can develop a very
deep understanding of where

01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:41.352
biological order comes from.

01:10:41.352 --> 01:10:43.732
But going from Darwin's
theory of evolution

01:10:43.732 --> 01:10:45.629
to genetic engineering
is a big step.

01:10:45.629 --> 01:10:47.920
By the same token, I do think
that in our understanding

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:50.020
of social economic
systems, we're

01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:54.410
just starting to realize that
these systems are computers.

01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:56.882
And we have a pretty deep
understanding of them

01:10:56.882 --> 01:10:59.840
that does not allow
us to engineer them.

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.319
One of the things
that I do think,

01:11:01.319 --> 01:11:03.120
though, is that sometimes,
the question, for example,

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:05.540
that you're asking now might
be a little bit of a trick

01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:08.980
question because you think
that economies are computers.

01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:12.480
Maybe the existence of countries
is kind of like a bad idea.

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.950
In some sense,
what you want to do

01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:17.370
is increase the computational
capacity of the planet

01:11:17.370 --> 01:11:20.020
and the prosperity
of all people.

01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:24.745
And countries are kind of like
a barrier for that to happen.

01:11:24.745 --> 01:11:26.120
Nowadays, for
instance, one thing

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:28.786
that I found ridiculous-- I'm an
anti-nationalist about nations.

01:11:28.786 --> 01:11:31.690
And as an anti-nationalist
about nations,

01:11:31.690 --> 01:11:34.710
I find it ridiculous
that even though we

01:11:34.710 --> 01:11:37.210
have learned that you should
not discriminate people because

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:39.930
of things that
they do not choose,

01:11:39.930 --> 01:11:43.590
like your ethnicity
or your gender,

01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:45.830
we still accept and
encourage discrimination

01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:48.445
based on the color of
people's passports.

01:11:48.445 --> 01:11:51.220
And that's bullshit,
and that's a barrier

01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:54.340
to the organization of people
into more efficient computers.

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:58.770
So maybe the best way to
help countries prosper

01:11:58.770 --> 01:12:02.150
is to get rid of these
divisions between countries

01:12:02.150 --> 01:12:06.010
in a much more global context.

01:12:06.010 --> 01:12:09.515
Obviously, sometimes those
really soothing effects

01:12:09.515 --> 01:12:12.130
are going to mean that
there's some people that now,

01:12:12.130 --> 01:12:14.244
because of some
protective measure,

01:12:14.244 --> 01:12:15.660
are doing better
than they should.

01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:17.402
And those people are
not going to want

01:12:17.402 --> 01:12:18.568
that type of redistribution.

01:12:18.568 --> 01:12:20.520
But I think that
over the long run,

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:23.362
it might be more fair
and better for everyone.

01:12:34.448 --> 01:12:35.700
AUDIENCE: I was just curious.

01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:38.560
According to this measure
of economic complexity

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:42.199
as a predictor of a country's
future economic growth, which

01:12:42.199 --> 01:12:45.073
countries are likely to
have strong economic growth

01:12:45.073 --> 01:12:46.031
in our future?

01:12:46.031 --> 01:12:49.863
Which countries currently
have the biggest disparity

01:12:49.863 --> 01:12:53.130
between economic complexity and
the current economic status?

01:12:53.130 --> 01:12:55.532
CESAR HIDALGO: So there
is some obvious candidates

01:12:55.532 --> 01:12:58.340
that everybody is aware
of, like China and India,

01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:02.428
some a little bit less obvious,
like Vietnam, and some,

01:13:02.428 --> 01:13:05.880
for example, that have a
lot of growth potential

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:09.230
but at the moment have
very low levels of income.

01:13:09.230 --> 01:13:12.145
So in some sense,
the growth is not

01:13:12.145 --> 01:13:14.770
going to translate into
those countries becoming

01:13:14.770 --> 01:13:16.040
large economic powers.

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:19.182
But it's going to be substantial
nevertheless, like countries

01:13:19.182 --> 01:13:20.390
in East Africa, for instance.

01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:22.015
East Africa has
managed to become

01:13:22.015 --> 01:13:24.925
a little bit more
industrialized than West Africa.

01:13:24.925 --> 01:13:26.870
And that industrialization
of East Africa

01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:27.790
that happened--
the garden center

01:13:27.790 --> 01:13:30.373
with the export of flowers, with
other products that they have

01:13:30.373 --> 01:13:35.856
been able to develop, as we see
that, it's implying that now,

01:13:35.856 --> 01:13:37.460
the level of income
of East Africa

01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:39.085
should start approaching
more like that

01:13:39.085 --> 01:13:42.490
of Latin America than the
one that they have right now.

01:13:42.490 --> 01:13:44.385
So those would be
a few examples.

01:13:44.385 --> 01:13:47.670
Countries that are
on the opposite side,

01:13:47.670 --> 01:13:49.400
obviously, we can
mention Greece,

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:51.863
but I think Greece already
gets too much of a bad rap here

01:13:51.863 --> 01:13:52.363
in Europe.

01:13:52.363 --> 01:13:55.920
You guys should
give them a break.

01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:57.420
You have all of
the countries that

01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:58.670
export a lot of raw materials.

01:13:58.670 --> 01:14:00.711
So all of the countries
that export raw materials

01:14:00.711 --> 01:14:03.540
are reliers on the relationship
because their income

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:07.016
is pegged to the national
resource endowments.

01:14:07.016 --> 01:14:10.160
So countries like Saudi
Arabia or Qatar or Chile,

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:13.090
or even Australia, if
they were to run out

01:14:13.090 --> 01:14:15.136
of natural resources,
or if the economy

01:14:15.136 --> 01:14:17.510
were to change in such a way
that the resources that they

01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:21.370
export is no longer needed,
it would be in deep trouble

01:14:21.370 --> 01:14:23.700
because their computers
are not as sophisticated

01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:27.000
as their income would suggest.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.750
