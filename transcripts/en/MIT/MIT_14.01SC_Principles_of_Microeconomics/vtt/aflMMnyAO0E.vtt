00:00:23.387 --> 00:00:28.880
PROFESSOR: All right, so today
we are going to finish up our

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.080
discussion of consumer
theory and then move

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.170
on to producer theory.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.030
That is, we're finishing up
what's behind the demand curve

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.440
and moving on to what's behind
the supply curve.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.310
But before we do that, I want
to talk about an application

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.030
of why income and substitution
effects are important.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.910
Income and substitution effects,
we talked about this

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.170
imaginary budget constraint.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.280
It seems like sort of
a vague concept.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.690
We talked last time about labor
supply and how you can

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.570
get some interestingly
different answers.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.840
But I want to talk about an
application now, of why

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.450
understanding income and
substitution effects can

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.600
really help you understand
the world a bit better.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.820
And the application I want to
talk about today is the case

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.660
of child labor in developing
countries.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.810
Now this is a terrible
problem worldwide.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.920
In developing countries in
particular, children are

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.610
pulled out of school to work.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.010
They then don't develop the
skills that can allow them to

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.830
earn high wages later in life
and as a result, the cycle of

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.370
impoverishment continues in
these nations, where these

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.560
children in turn have low
wage jobs and make

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.030
their kids go to work.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.060
And it's a major problem in
the developing world.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.880
And we all know that one way
to help countries out of

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.850
poverty is to help them get
their kids to get education.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.510
Education is the key to getting
out of poverty.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.185
And you can't get education
if you're working.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.330
I think that's a generally
recognized fact.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.720
A more interesting,
controversial fact is well,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.460
what does this imply
for the benefits or

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.250
cost of free trade?

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.530
We'll talk about free trade
later in the semester and

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.335
we'll come back to this, but
basically the idea is look, if

00:01:56.335 --> 00:02:00.510
you have free trade, then poor
countries can sell more goods

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.470
to rich countries and that will
allow them to raise their

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.750
standard of living.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.080
But many of you will point out
that that's contradictory with

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.370
our concern over child labor.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:13.670
Which is if a poor country is
going to sell more goods to a

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.220
rich country, then maybe kids
in that country are going to

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.930
have to work harder to
make those goods.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.920
And one concern people have
when they talk about free

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.980
trade agreements is essentially
we're dooming the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.520
children of these impoverished
countries to work harder to

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.530
make the goods that rich
countries want.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.270
And that if these impoverished
countries weren't engaging in

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.100
making all these textiles and
all the things these rich

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.470
countries want, maybe their
kids would be getting an

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.970
education instead.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.690
So that's a concern that's been
raised about free trade,

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.440
but in fact, what we can
understand from understanding

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.890
income and substitution effects
is that, in fact, that

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.040
claim may not be true.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.200
In fact, the effect
of free trade on

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.070
child labor is ambiguous.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.060
And that's what I want to talk
through now, an application of

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.650
why understanding income and
substitution effects matter.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.930
And there's a very interesting
study by two professors at

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.390
Dartmouth who studied the impact
of trade liberalization

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.700
in Vietnam.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.400
Vietnam used to have a system
where they would not allow

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.420
domestic producers to
sell rice abroad.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.160
Domestic rice producers had to
sell that rice only in Vietnam

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.580
and then they introduced free
trade provisions in Vietnam

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.150
which allowed them to sell
that rice abroad as well.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.190
And one concern that was raised
is that would mean kids

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.005
in Vietnam would have to work
harder producing rice so it

00:03:23.005 --> 00:03:24.550
could be sold around
the world.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.190
Let's see whether
that was true.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.150
Well, to think about that, let's
first think about it

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.920
theoretically.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.170
So let's go to figure 8-1.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.080
Figure 8-1 shows the demand for
rice, D sub V the demand

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.965
for rice in Vietnam, D sub W is
the demand for Vietnamese

00:03:41.965 --> 00:03:43.215
rice worldwide.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.820
D sub V is the Vietnamese demand
for Vietnamese rice, D

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.800
sub W is the world demand for
Vietnamese rice, and S sub V

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.430
is the supply of Vietnamese
rice.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.910
And we assume demand curves are
downward sloping, supply

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.920
curves are upward sloping,
as usual.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.020
So if there was a worldwide
market where Vietnamese rice

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.720
farmers could sell their rice
to the entire world, then

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.291
you'd have an equilibrium
price P sub W and an

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:20.500
equilibrium quantity
of Q sub W.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.530
What happened was until 1989,
that was not the case.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:32.468
Before 1989, the government
imposed a quota which said

00:04:32.468 --> 00:04:36.880
that rice producers in Vietnam
could not sell effectively,

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.200
could not sell outside
Vietnam.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.320
It wasn't quite that easy, but
you could think of it this

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.590
way, they could not sell
outside Vietnam.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.460
Instead, they could only sell
the amount that Vietnamese

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.120
citizens demanded of rice, which
meant that they sold Qv

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.910
units of rice at a price, Pv.
So there was a government

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.210
imposition which said
effectively--

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.660
not quite, but effectively--

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.000
you can only sell rice in
Vietnam, so we're going to

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.520
sell Qv at a price, Pv.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.840
So then what happened was
in the early 1990s, the

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.420
government weakened this quota
so that by 1997, there was no

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.420
longer a quota.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.620
Rice farmers were allowed to
sell wherever they want.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:22.920
So effectively, the country
moved from Qv, Pv to Qw, Pw.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.660
Essentially, it expanded the
market for Vietnamese rice so

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.990
that they were able to sell a
larger quantity at a higher

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.220
price on the worldwide market.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.500
And the difference between
Qv and Qw were exports.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.300
So basically, the government
allowed them to export an

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.600
extra amount of rice, Qw minus
Qv, and allowed them to obtain

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.770
a higher price for their rice.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.633
So we'll talk later about
whether this is a good idea or

00:05:50.633 --> 00:05:51.570
a bad idea in general.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.450
We'll talk about free trade and
get on to free trade later

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:54.400
in the semester.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.680
Hint, we like free trade
as economists.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.390
I think most of you probably
knew that, and we'll talk

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.010
about that later in
the semester.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.770
But now I want to focus
specifically on one question,

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.480
which is what did this
do to child labor?

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:14.670
Well, if we go the
next figure, if

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.420
you look for a second--

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.880
forget the shifting
supply curves.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.400
The market for child labor is
initially at equilibrium at a

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.180
supply of child labor of S1--

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.226
that is, the higher the wage,
the more the kids will work--

00:06:30.226 --> 00:06:32.880
and demand for child
labor of D1--

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.000
that is, the higher the wage,
the less the demand there is

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.310
for child labor.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.920
And we're in some initial
equilibrium where L1 kids work

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.510
at a wage, W1.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.540
And let me highlight an
important thing about the

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.610
supply of labor of kids.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.380
If the kids aren't working,
they're in school.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.190
The notion is not if the kids
aren't working, they're

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.330
sitting at home.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.710
If the kids aren't working,
they're in school.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.070
So basically, the more kids are
working, the fewer kids

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.920
are in school.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:03.170
So you have this supply, S1,
and this demand, D1.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.370
So what free trade does is it
shifts out the demand for

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.300
child labor.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.490
Because now you need to produce
more rice, you need

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.050
kids to produce it, so
it shifts out to D2.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.470
It's not marked in this diagram,
but you would end up,

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.810
if you could see where D2
intersects with S1, you'd end

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:32.540
up with a lot more child
labor at a higher wage.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.880
And that's the argument for
why free trade is bad for

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.820
child labor.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.820
Because it increases demand for
child labor and therefore

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.930
increases the amount of child
labor that's used.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:50.960
But what that argument misses is
the income effect, which is

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.600
that the rice farmers in
Vietnam are now richer.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.220
And one thing they'll do with
their wealth is buy their kids

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.130
more education.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:01.870
That is, think about the
utility function

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.050
of these rice farmers.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:04.360
They don't want their
kids to work.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.600
They understand that
their kids are

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.800
better off with education.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.310
So what would happen if
they won the lottery?

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.960
What would happen if they won
the lottery is they'd use some

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:12.986
of that money to say
hey kids, you don't

00:08:12.986 --> 00:08:14.130
have to work anymore.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.050
You get to now go to school
instead and build yourselves a

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:17.360
brighter future.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.370
Well, the higher price for rice
that exists through world

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:22.330
trade is like them winning
the lottery.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.480
Suddenly, rice farmers are
richer because each unit they

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.270
produce is sold at
a higher price.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.450
What are they going to do
with that higher wealth?

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.010
They're going to allow their
kids to work less.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:34.996
They're going to say, we're
effectively richer because

00:08:34.996 --> 00:08:37.950
we're now selling our rice
at a higher price.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.190
As a caring parent who's richer,
I'm going to send my

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.240
kids to school instead
of having them work.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.340
How do we manifest that
in this diagram?

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.750
As an inward shift in the
supply of child labor.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.910
That is, children get pulled off
the market because their

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:54.100
parents now say, I'm going to
send them to school instead.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.850
So the supply curve for child
labor shifts inwards.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.110
Now, how much it shifts inwards
determines what

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.640
ultimately happens
to child labor.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.500
If it shifts inwards a little
bit from S1 to S2, then child

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.970
labor on net still increases
from L1 to L2.

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.340
That is, the demand shift
exceeds the supply shift and

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.430
on net child labor increases.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.780
That is, on net, free trade
does increase child labor.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.900
But if supply shifts in a lot,
if parents are a lot richer

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.060
and send their kids to school
a lot, then actually the

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:28.490
supply of child labor could
fall from L1 to L3.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.980
You could have less child labor,
even though the demand

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.340
for it's gone up.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.090
And that's because of
income effects.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.550
The importance of income effects
is that the families

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.460
are now richer, so they're
pulling their

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:40.850
kids out of the market.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:42.550
And they're pulling their kids
out of the market in such

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:48.350
numbers that it exceeds the
excess demand for child labor.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.120
So once again, we see the
power of income and

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.980
substitution effects.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.660
We have the standard market
operation, which is g.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.960
We want more rice, we need to
hire more kids to produce it.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.790
But we're forgetting the income
effect, which is the

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.170
price of rice has gone up.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.280
Farmers are now richer, they're
now going to send

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.040
their kids to school instead
of making them work in the

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.870
rice paddies.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:09.870
OK?

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:14.310
So that is the importance of
understanding the subtle

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:18.230
argument that comes forth when
you think more completely

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.860
about income and substitution
effects and when you don't

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.530
stop and just say, gee,
more rice exported

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:25.470
means more child labor.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.790
So the question is, which
of these is right?

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:29.320
OK?

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.620
Which of these is right?

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.200
How do we know whether free
trade increases or decreases

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:34.970
the demand for child labor?

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.420
Let me first stop and ask a
question about the theory.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.170
People understand why an
increase in free trade can

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:44.280
either lead to more kids working
or less kids working.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.000
Yeah?

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.900
AUDIENCE: I'm not sure how you
would sustain that increase in

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:50.880
demand for rice.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.065
Because if their kids won't work
anymore, how will they

00:10:54.065 --> 00:10:55.780
keep up that increase
in demand of

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.740
rice, keep them wealthy?

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.280
Well, see, here's the key point,
which is that the price

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.070
has gone up.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.250
So the price has gone up, so
they don't have to increase

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.830
the supply that much.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:10.310
So the kids could work less,
they could work more, or they

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:12.030
could just not supply
that much more rice.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.140
But the fact that they sell
it in a worldwide market

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.580
increases the demand so that
they're getting a higher price

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.830
and that makes them wealthier.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.060
So now we have to ask,
what's the truth?

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.150
What happened?

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:28.250
Well, the answer is that
how do we tell this?

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.470
Well, the way we tell this is
we can look, we can use the

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.490
fact that the increase in the
price of rice varied across

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:36.100
the country.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.890
In some parts of Vietnam, those
that were very close to

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:43.950
the border and it was easy to
export, there was a big

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:47.050
increase in the demand for rice,
a big price increase.

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:50.050
In other parts of Vietnam, those
more internal where it's

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:52.490
a huge transportation cost to
get to the coast and therefore

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.360
export it, it's like
nothing happened.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.760
So you can actually ask, what
happened to child labor in the

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.860
areas close to the border where
the price of rice went

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.670
up a lot and therefore there's
a big effect of this free

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:07.670
trade, versus the areas more
internal to the country where

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.770
price of rice didn't
change much?

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.080
And by comparing those two, you
can ask, what happened to

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.780
child labor in those
two areas?

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:18.480
What you find is that child
labor went down in the areas

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.990
near the coast. They got so much
richer from these higher

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:24.760
prices that on net, they used
fewer kids to work.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.270
That is, the supply shift was
larger than the demand shift.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.950
So actually, free trade
lowered overall

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:33.430
use of child labor.

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.940
Free trade lowered the overall
use of child labor so that

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:41.520
freeing up trade was good for
kids, not bad for kids.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.410
We'll talk later about other
arguments about why free trade

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.430
is good or not, but this is an
important point where you can

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:49.150
get beyond a simple intuition
of, gee, more kids are going

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.700
to work, to say wait a second.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:55.540
That's offset by the fact that
the higher worldwide prices

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.450
led parents to allow their kids
to go to school rather

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:00.570
than go to work.

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.550
And that's an example of
the power of income and

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.890
substitution effects.

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:10.000
And the power of this theory
for understanding how you

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.540
might not get what
seems, initially,

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.360
an intuitive answer.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.890
OK, questions about that
example, how it relates to

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:18.090
consumer theory, income
or substitution

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.130
effects, any of that?

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:20.660
OK.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:24.750
So that's where we are going
to stop on consumer theory,

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.110
and that's where the material
for the exam will stop.

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:28.900
You can't leave, but that's
where the material for the

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.480
exam stops, OK?

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.670
So the exam will cover
everything up to

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.745
through this point.

00:13:34.745 --> 00:13:37.370
The exam will be on
consumer theory.
