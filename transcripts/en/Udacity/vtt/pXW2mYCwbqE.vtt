For this quiz, I want you to analyze a Twitter AJAX request.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.080
Start off by loading up any Twitter feed.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.670
Open up the Network tab in DevTools and then scroll down so more stories load.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.660
You should see an AJAX request get sent out inside the Network tab.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:16.810
Open it up and

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.490
then see if you can find the name of the property that contains all of

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.760
the HTML for new tweets.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.540
Type your answer in here.
