00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
With the advent of freezers, we're able to

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.360
keep our food lasting longer than ever before,

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.460
But is there a difference between fresh and frozen produce in terms of nutrition?

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.300
Which should you be eating?

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.000
You instinct may be to shout out "Of course fresh food is better. It's fresh."

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.040
And you may be right. But it's highly dependent on the circumstances.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.560
In many instances, the food you take off the shelf in a grocery store

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.400
has been harvasted under ripe to avoid damage during travel time.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.040
This means that it hasn't yet reached its peak nutrition.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.260
Furthermore, the minute it was picked, its nutritional content began to deteriorate.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.900
The food is then loaded on a truck, boat or plane, travels for days and waits on a shelf for you to choose it.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.980
After, which it may sit in your fridge for a few more days before being eaten.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.740
Over this period of potentially weeks, the food may lose up to 50% of its nutritional value.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.280
Frozen foods on the other hand are picked when they're ripe and frozen immediately.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.600
And while the quick freeze process does affect some vitamin content,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.840
it essentially freezes, or locks most of the nutrients in place.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.640
Next to the fresh produce that has been sitting around for weeks,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.300
there's no doubt that frozen foods can contain more nutrition,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.780
particularly during the month that local produce is not in season and travelling far distances.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.920
In a series of studies, after 3 days of storage, frozen broccoli had higher levels of Vitamin C and Beta-Carotene.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.000
Frozen blueberries were much higher in polyphenols and anthocyanins,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.600
and frozen sprouts scored higher in all nutrient measurements.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.900
Of course if you pick a fresh vegetable from your garden or get it from your local farmer's market,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.900
and eat it that date nothing could be quite compared to both the nutrition and the taste.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.000
But unless you're able to shop every few days, frozen produce could be a great nutritionally comparable alternative.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.300

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.300
Check out our friends at UpDesk who have created these amazing height adjustable whiteboard desks,

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.100
which we now proudly use.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.300
Jot down ideas when they hit you, or just doodle on your desk.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.000
And if you watched our video on sitting down, you know how important it is to be standing more often.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.260
