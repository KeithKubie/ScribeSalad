00:00:00.376 --> 00:00:01.750
What I want to do
with this video

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.250
is cover something called the
triple product expansion--

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.620
or Lagrange's
formula, sometimes.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.090
And it's really just
a simplification

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.530
of the cross product
of three vectors,

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.400
so if I take the cross product
of a, and then b cross c.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.820
And what we're
going to do is, we

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.130
can express this really
as sum and differences

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.266
of dot products.

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.640
Well, not just
dot products-- dot

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.099
products scaling
different vectors.

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:28.431
You're going to see what I mean.

00:00:28.431 --> 00:00:30.540
But it simplifies this
expression a good bit,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.830
because cross products
are hard to take.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.230
They're computationally
intensive

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.190
and, at least in my
mind, they're confusing.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.565
Now this isn't
something you have

00:00:37.565 --> 00:00:39.740
to know if you're going to
be dealing with vectors,

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.089
but it's useful to know.

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:42.880
My motivation for
actually doing this video

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.230
is I saw some problems for the
Indian Institute of Technology

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.340
entrance exam that seems to
expect that you know Lagrange's

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.400
formula, or the triple
product expansion.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.730
So let's see how we
can simplify this.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.230
So to do that,
let's start taking

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.480
the cross product of b and c.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.510
And in all of these
situations, I'm

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.020
just going to assume--
let's say I have vector a.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.860
That's going to be a,
the x component of vector

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:19.020
a times the unit of vector i
plus the y component of vector

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.130
a times the unit vector j
plus the z component of vector

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.580
a times unit vector k.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.830
And I could do the same
things for b and c.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.610
So if I say b sub y,
I'm talking about what's

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.010
scaling the j component
in the b vector.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.370
So let's first take this
cross product over here.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.590
And if you've seen me
take cross products,

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.370
you know that I like to do
these little determinants.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.620
Let me just take it over here.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:51.710
So b cross c is going to be
equal to the determinant.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.512
And I put an i, j, k up here.

00:01:55.512 --> 00:01:57.720
This is actually the definition
of the cross product,

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.689
so no proof necessary to
show you why this is true.

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.730
This is just one way to
remember the dot product,

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.396
if you remember how
to take determinants

00:02:04.396 --> 00:02:06.190
of three-by-threes.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.310
And we'll put b's x
term, b's y coefficient,

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.870
and b's z component.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.880
And then you do the same
thing for the c, cx, cy, cz.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.070
And then this is going
to be equal to-- so

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.620
first you have the i component.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.940
So it's going to be the
i component times b.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.230
So you ignore this
column and this row.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:39.426
So bycz minus bzcy.

00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:40.800
So I'm just ignoring
all of this.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.750
And I'm looking
at this two-by-two

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.943
over here, minus bzcy.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.420
And then we want to
subtract the j component.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.450
Remember, we alternate signs
when we take our determinant.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.180
Subtract that.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.050
And then we take out
that column and that row,

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.090
so it's going to be bxcz--
this is a little monotonous,

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.290
but hopefully, it'll have
an interesting result--

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.333
bxcz minus bzcx.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.440
And then finally,
plus the k component.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:26.886
OK, we're going to have
bx times cy minus bycx.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.270
We just did the dot product, and
now we want to take the-- oh,

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.950
sorry, we just did
the cross product.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.324
I don't want to
get you confused.

00:03:41.324 --> 00:03:43.990
We just took the cross
product of b and c.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.805
And now we need take the
cross product of that with a,

00:03:46.805 --> 00:03:50.022
or the cross product of a with
this thing right over here.

00:03:50.022 --> 00:03:50.730
So let's do that.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.430
Instead of rewriting
the vector, let

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.850
me just set up
another matrix here.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.280
So let me write
my i j k up here.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.010
And then let me
write a's components.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.470
So we have a sub x,
a sub y, a sub z.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.040
And then let's clean
this up a little bit.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.810
Let's ignore this.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.090
We're just looking at-- no,
I want to do that in black.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.510
Let's do this in black, so
that we can kind of erase that.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.840
Now this is a
minus j times that.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.340
So what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.756
to get rid of the
minus and the j,

00:04:23.756 --> 00:04:28.210
but I am going to rewrite
this with the signs swapped.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:40.770
So if you swap the signs,
it's actually bzcx minus bxcz.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.260
So let me delete
everything else.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.139
So I just took the negative
and I multiplied it by this.

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.180
I hope I'm not making any
careless mistakes here,

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.240
so let me just check and make
my brush size little bit bigger,

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.150
so I can erase that a
little more efficiently.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.700
There you go.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.710
And then we also want to get
rid of that right over there.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.480
Now let me get my brush size
back down to normal size.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.090
All right.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.630
So now let's just take
this cross product.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.359
So once again, set it
up as a determinant.

00:05:10.359 --> 00:05:11.900
And what I'm only
going to focus on--

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.170
because it'll take the video,
or it'll take me forever

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.970
if I were to do the i,
j, and k components--

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.170
I'm just going to focus
on the i component,

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.180
just on the x component
of this cross product.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.890
And then we can
see that we'll get

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.740
the same result for
the j and the k.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.240
And then we can see
what, hopefully,

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.490
this simplifies down to.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.240
So if we just focus on
the i component here,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.060
this is going to be
i times-- and we just

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.360
look at this two-by-two
matrix right over here.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.890
We ignore i's column, i's row.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.780
And we have ay
times all of this.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.340
So let me just multiply it out.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:06:03.480
So it's ay times bxcy, minus
ay times by, times bycx.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.240
And then we're going
to want to subtract.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.134
We're going to have
minus az times this.

00:06:13.134 --> 00:06:14.050
So let's just do that.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.010
So it's minus, or
negative, azbzcx.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.880
And then we have a
negative az times this,

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.425
so it's plus azbxcz.

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:30.930
And now what I'm
going to do-- this

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.150
is a little bit of a
trick for this proof

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.030
right here, just so that we
get the results that I want.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.890
I'm just going to add and
subtract the exact same thing.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.501
So I'm going to add an axbxcx.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.160
And then I'm going to subtract
an axbxcx, minus axbxcx.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.820
So clearly, I have not
changed this expression.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.770
I've just added and
subtracted the same thing.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.250
And let's see what
we can simplify.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.270
Remember, this is
just the x component

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.580
of our triple product.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.930
Just the x component.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.830
But to do this,
let me factor out.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.970
I'm going to factor out a bx.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.210
So let me do this,
let me get the bx.

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.170
So if I were to
factor it out-- I'm

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.070
going to factor it out of
this term that has a bx.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.060
I'm going to factor
it out of this term.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.860
And then I'm going to
factor it out of this term.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.030
So if I take the bx out,
I'm going to have an aycy.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.320
Actually, let me write it
a little bit differently.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.600
Let me factor it out
of this one first.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.440
So then it's going
to have an axcx.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.410
a sub x, c sub x.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.100
So I used this one up.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.030
And then I'll do this one now.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:58.700
Plus, if I factor the
bx out, I get ay cy.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:59.815
I've used that one now.

00:07:59.815 --> 00:08:00.815
And now I have this one.

00:08:00.815 --> 00:08:02.660
I'm going to factor the bx out.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.920
So I'm left with a plus az, cz.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.260
So that's all of those.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.790
So I've factored that out.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.530
And now, from these
right over here,

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.180
let me factor out a negative cx.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.380
And so, if I do that-- let me go
to this term right over here--

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.400
I'm going to have an axbx
when I factor it out.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.200
So an axbx, cross that out.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.590
And then, over here, I'm
going to have an ayby.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:34.370
Remember, I'm factoring
out a negative cx,

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:39.460
so I'm going to have
a plus ay, sub by.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:44.530
And then, finally, I'm going
to have a plus az, az bz.

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.310
And what is this?

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.740
Well, this right
here, in green, this

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:56.290
is the exact same thing as
the dot products of a and c.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:09:01.010
This is the dot product
of the vectors a and c.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:05.520
It's the dot product of
this vector and that vector.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:10.050
So that's the dot
of a and c times

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:19.840
the x component
of b minus-- I'll

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.660
do this in the same--
minus-- once again,

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:29.790
this is the dot product of
a and b now, minus a dot b

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.990
times the x component of c.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:34.490
And we can't forget,
all of this was

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.450
multiplied by the unit vector i.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.140
We're looking at the x
component, or the i component

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.550
of that whole triple product.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:46.070
So that's going
to be all of this.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:51.570
All of this is times
the unit vector i.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.510
Now, if we do this exact
same thing-- and I'm

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.560
not going to do it, because
it's computationally intensive.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.700
But I think it won't be a
huge leap of faith for you.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.210
This is for the x component.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.830
If I were to do the exact same
thing for the y component,

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.600
for the j component--
so it'll be plus--

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.840
if I do the same thing
for the j component,

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.840
we can really just
pattern match.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.500
We have bx, cx, that's
for the x component.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:19.440
We'll have by and c y
for the j component.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.540
And then this is not
component-specific,

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:29.860
so it will be a dot c over here,
and minus a dot b over here.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:31.770
You can verify any of
these for yourself,

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:33.240
if you don't believe me.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.600
But it's the exact same
process we just did.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.050
And then, finally, for the z
component, or the k component--

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:41.930
let me put parentheses
over here-- same idea.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:47.240
You're going to have bz, cz.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.920
And then you're going to
have a dot b over there.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:57.920
And then you're going to
have a dot c over here.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.790
Now what does this become?

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:04.500
How can we simplify this?

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.780
Well, this right over here,
we can expand this out.

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:10.720
We can factor out
an a dot c from all

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.020
of these terms over here.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.340
And remember, this is going
to be multiplied times i.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.710
Actually, let me not
skip too many steps,

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:20.340
just because I want you
to believe what I'm doing.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:24.724
So if we expand the i here--
instead of rewriting it,

00:11:24.724 --> 00:11:25.890
let me just do it like this.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.770
It's a little bit
messier, but let me just--

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.320
so I could write this i
there and that i there.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.820
I'm kind of just distributing
that x unit vector,

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.560
or the i unit vector.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.270
And let me do the
same thing for j.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.060
So I could put the j there.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.690
And I could put the
j right over there.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.460
And then I could do the
same thing for the k,

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.890
put the k there, and
then put the k there.

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.390
And now what are these?

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:58.840
Well, this part right
over here is exactly

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:05.910
the same thing as
a dot c times--

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:10.400
and I'll write it
out here-- bx times i

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:21.650
plus by times j,
plus bz times k.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.390
And then, from that,
we're going to subtract

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:25.900
all of this, a dot b.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:32.617
We're going to subtract a dot
b times the exact same thing.

00:12:32.617 --> 00:12:34.200
And you're going to
notice, this right

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.720
here is the same
thing as vector b.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.880
That is vector b.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.770
When you do it over here,
you're going to get vector c.

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:42.520
So I'll just write it over here.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.870
You're just going
to get vector c.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:48.600
So just like that, we
have a simplification

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.110
for our triple product.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.150
I know it took us a
long time to get here,

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:54.590
but this is a simplification.

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:57.150
It might not look like one,
but computationally it is.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:58.470
It's easier to do.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:05.760
If I have-- I'll try to
color-code it-- a cross b

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.820
cross-- let me do it in
all different colors-- c,

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:13.690
we just saw that this is going
to be equivalent to-- and

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:16.430
one way to think about it is,
it's going to be, you take

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.190
the first vector times the dot
product of-- the first vector

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.210
in this second dot
product, the one

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:23.716
that we have our
parentheses around,

00:13:23.716 --> 00:13:25.340
the one we would have
to do first-- you

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.370
take your first vector there.

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.790
So it's vector b.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.510
And you multiply that times the
dot product of the other two

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:36.035
vectors, so a dot c.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:46.850
And from that, you subtract
the second vector multiplied

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:53.900
by the dot product of the
other two vectors, of a dot b.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.030
And we're done.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:59.260
This is our triple
product expansion.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.130
Now, once again,
this isn't something

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.042
that you really have to know.

00:14:04.042 --> 00:14:05.750
You could always,
obviously, multiply it.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:09.660
You could actually
do it by hand.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:10.930
You don't have to know this.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:14.080
But if you have
really hairy vectors,

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.055
or if this was some type
of math competition,

00:14:16.055 --> 00:14:18.425
and sometimes it simplifies
real fast when you reduce it

00:14:18.425 --> 00:14:20.870
to dot products, this is
a useful thing to know,

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:24.001
Lagrange's formula, or the
triple product expansion.
