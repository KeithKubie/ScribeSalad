00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.000
Hey, it's me Destin

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.969
Sorry for the vertical video there. I was recording for the Instagram story

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.570
So I caught this bird with my hand and I got to thinking about it

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.699
It's kind of a shame to have a bird and let it go and not film it in slow motion

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.219
So, that's what we're gonna do. Alright, this is my daughter's

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.029
butterfly

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.029
Thing. Where you at little bird?

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.750
Hey

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.750
calm down buddy

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.689
Calm down, calm down

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.599
There you go calm down

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.469
Okay, let's hold you where you don't get hurt

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.719
There you go. All right. Let's go let you go. What do you think? So

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:53.639
I've always been fascinated by birds their wings in particular. You see that the primary feathers one, two, three, four, five six, seven, eight

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.469
Nine, I thought they had ten primary feathers. Maybe they do and then these are the secondary feathers

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.829
And then the feathers around his eyes

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.419
It's really cool. He's scared so we're gonna try to try to get him out of here real quick

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.209
He's wanting to fly away. I know this isn't like a super in-depth smartereveryday video

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.820
But this is just a target of opportunity something to learn really quick

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.820
What I want to know is when he takes off

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.159
if his tail feathers are correctin' immediately or it has to wait until he's moving in flight before he starts using those. We probably

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.859
Won't see that because we literally have one shot to do this

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.969
But I'm really excited. Did you see his eyes like the little

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.269
Feathery things around his eyes. I've never noticed that anyway, he's getting tired. We got to let him go

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.939
Alright here we go. Releasing the bird

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.350
Three, two, one

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.759
That was fast. All right, let's look at it. I mean we we've probably just got the launch but I like birds

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.950
All right, I set out to make a cute little video of a bird hopping out of my hand

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.649
But I actually learned a ton from this footage. Number one

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.760
It's clear that the bird hops out of my hand, and I've never thought about that

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.210
I'm sure that's just common knowledge to ornithologists, but for some reason I always thought birds just start flapping to fly

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.169
And he's hopping why would they not use their legs to get further away from the ground?

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.330
So their wings don't hit the ground or my hand or whatever. That's just cool. I've never thought about that number two

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.249
I think it's neat that he points his tail towards the ground on that hop

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.050
And I've got to believe he's doing that to reduce the vertical component of drag so that he can hop farther

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.919
Another thing that happens is on the downstroke. You can see that his feathers are together

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.479
But his feathers delaminate to reduce drag on the backstroke, we've seen that in a smartereveryday episode in the past

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.080
It's fun to see it again here number four. It's cool to see him transition that tail from being pointed down. He raises it

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.300
So he's getting ready for horizontal flight so that transition from vertical flight to horizontal flight

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.540
He straightens his tail out to get it in the game. He's getting ready to make corrections in horizontal flight

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.980
I think it's really cool to make your own observations because all this probably exists in a scientific paper somewhere

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.469
But it's fun to actually see it for yourself and try to understand. I'm gonna be looking for these things

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.690
Every time I see a bird take off from now on. Alright, that's enough of this bird. You want to see my garden?

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.030
These are my sunflowers. I

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.600
grow them for

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.600
All the ladies in my life

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.850
My daughter my mom

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.870
my wife

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.470
While we're here, you want to see my corns-es?

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.720
My corns-es are bad. I think I overwatered them. These are my corn-es

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.459
These are my corns-es and

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.309
Right here look at this bad boy. Look at it.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.379
Beautiful

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.379
It's a good-looking melon right there

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:10.920
anyway

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.630
It's a simple video. I hope you enjoyed it. I'm Destin. You're getting smarter every day. Have a good one. Bye
