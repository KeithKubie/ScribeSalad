00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.800
Officially the Apollo 10 mission of 1969 was
a dress rehearsal for the more famous Apollo

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.240
11- designed to test all of procedures and
equipment needed to land on the Moon save

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.880
for the actual act of the landing itself.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.690
(To assure it was just a practice run, they
did not put enough fuel in the LM to land

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.020
and leave the Moon.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.160
They felt that if they did, Thomas Stafford
and Eugene Cernan might just decide to go

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.160
for it.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.399
Interestingly, Cernan and Stafford almost
were the first to land on the Moon anyway,

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.790
as the crew mistakenly put duplicate commands
into the flight computer and, upon the ascent

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.649
engine ignition, the LM started spinning nearly
out of control because of it.

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.829
They only regained control of the craft a
few revolutions away from the situation being

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.800
unrecoverable, which ultimately would have
seen them crashing onto the Moon.)

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.109
While many of the mission’s details have
been overshadowed by the later Apollo 11 mission,

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.829
one in particular still stands out- that time
a couple pieces of fecal matter free-floated

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.500
around the command module for several minutes.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.390
This scatological tidbit from the history
of space exploration occurred on the sixth

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.560
day of the Apollo 10 mission as they were
orbiting the Moon.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.820
As recorded in official NASA transcripts of
the mission, the first incident was initially

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.910
noticed by Commander Tom Stafford.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.230
The other two aboard were John Young and the
aforementioned Eugene Cernan, both of whom

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.430
would later walk on the surface of the Moon
as part of the Apollo 16 and 17 missions respectively.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.200
(While Commander Stafford never walked on
the Moon, he is the joint record holder for

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.350
the highest speed ever attained by man, relative
to Earth, when the Apollo 10 craft reached

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.160
24,791 miles per hour.)

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.050
As noted, Commander Stafford noticed the floating
feces first, alerting his crewmates to its

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.930
presence by exclaiming “Oh” quickly followed
by a bemused, “Who did it?”

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.040
According to the official transcripts of the
mission, the next crew member to notice the

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.230
flying, fibre-rich projectile was Young, who
let out a “Where did that come from?”

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.230
as the fecal matter floated slowly into his
eye-line.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.840
Cernan apparently didn’t notice the poop
until it was explicitly identified by Stafford

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.110
who alerted both him and ground control to
its existence by saying quite matter of factly:

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.110
Give me a napkin quick.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.950
There’s a turd floating through the air!

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.569
The transcript further went on to reveal that
Stafford and the rest of the crew were stifling

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.030
laughter throughout this exchange, with several
portions of said transcript detailing that

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.500
the turd invasion was punctuated by fits of
laughter and giggling unable to be credited

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.600
to a singular member of the crew.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.310
After some playful banter, Cernan heroically,
and with no regard for his personal safety,

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.730
decided to dispose of the so-named turd with
a nearby plastic bag.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.820
Shortly after normal mission tasks resumed,
the trio were interrupted by a second bit

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.490
of fecal matter floating listlessly through
the air, prompting yet another sweeping round

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.000
of denial from each astronaut, with Stafford
insisting that his poop was stickier than

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.640
the one currently enjoying its interstellar
freedom.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.540
Young likewise asserted that his poop “hit
that bag”.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.430
The “bag” in this context referred to
the decidedly low-tech way astronauts had

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.790
to deal with feces back then and the reason
why said astronauts seemed to know in detail

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.790
how “sticky” their rear expulsions were.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:05.790
Fecal Collection Bag
Fecal Collection Bag

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:06.790
As we’ve talked about before, (see: How
do Astronauts Go to Bathroom in Space), doing

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.820
one’s necessaries in space has been an issue
almost since the dawn of space travel.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.430
For instance, on the morning of May 5, 1961,
astronaut Alan Shepard, the second man / first

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.650
American in space, was forced to sit through
several hours of delays on what was otherwise

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.330
supposed to be a very brief mission.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.130
He ultimately remarked, “Man, I gotta pee.”

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.620
With no good options available, he was at
first implored to “hold it”.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.750
Eventually things became critical and it was
decided that Shepard should pee in his spacesuit

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.310
after its electronics were temporarily deactivated
with the hope that his peeing in the suit

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.959
wouldn’t short out his bio-sensors and give
him a jolt in the process.

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.630
The hack was mostly successful in that he
didn’t electrocute himself and he no longer

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.730
had to pee, but it did ultimately short the
sensors.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.470
Soon after, Shepard became the first American
in space… soaking in his own urine.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.490
Today, most astronaut waste is handled by
a remarkably sophisticated space-toilet that

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.400
simply vacuums things up.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.240
Back in the late 1960s though, astronauts
didn’t have this luxury and had to poop

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.100
into what basically amounted to a plastic
bag taped to their butts.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.230
The exact procedure for pooping in space at
the time, as outlined in the Apollo Experience

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.460
Report – Crew Provisions and Equipment Subsystem
published by NASA in March of 1972, was as

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.460
follows:

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.630
To use the FCA (Fecal-Collection Assembly),
the crewman attaches the outer fecal bag properly

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.310
and proceeds with fecal elimination.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.550
Upon completion of the action and subsequent
sanitary cleansing, the tissues and refuse

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.509
are placed in the inner fecal/emesis bag.

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:35.069
The crewman then removes the germicide pouch,
cuts the outer protective seal, and places

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:36.069
it in the inner bag.

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:40.270
Finally, all items are placed into the outer
fecal bag, the bag is sealed, the germicide

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.699
pouch is ruptured by hand pressure, the bag
is kneaded, and the contents are stowed in

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.729
the waste-stowage compartment….

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.740
Nothing has proved more effective than the
current system, which has proved adequate

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.509
for all flights, although the crewmen have
expressed dislike for it.

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:56.960
If you’re wondering, the germicide pouch
was there to kill off as many microbes as

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.759
possible to reduce the likelihood of microbial
produced gases swelling the bag to the point

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:02.759
of bursting.

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:06.900
However, NASA wasn’t content to assume no
bags would turn into fecal grenades, so they

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.330
planned for that contingency as well, as noted
in the report:

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.210
If any fecal bags were to rupture during the
mission, the waste-stowage compartment could

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.620
emit fecal odors.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.800
Therefore, a bladder and an overboard vent
system have been placed in the compartment.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.400
The system contains a 215-micron filter, a
check-relief valve, and a vent valve to the

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.440
urine overboard dump line.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.839
During boost, the waste-stowage vent valve
is opened to purge nitrogen wastes from the

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:32.839
crew compartment.

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:36.860
A check valve vents into the crew compartment
at differential pressure of 2 psi.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.520
After the vent valve has been closed during
a mission, the check valve vents if ruptured

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.039
fecal bags create a pressure of 2 psi.

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:47.439
Then the crewman, alerted by the fecal odor,
can position the waste-stowage valve to vent

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:49.729
the odor overboard at periodic intervals.

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:53.500
Not perhaps planning enough for human error,
by some unknown means some of the poop escaped

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.789
its plastic prison during Apollo 10, leaving
it free to wander around the command module,

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:01.310
boldly going where no turd had gone before.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.990
So who let free the smelly projectiles?

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.800
Despite extensive research into the matter
FOR SCIENCE, unfortunately who the poop belonged

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.199
to cannot be conclusively established.

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:13.460
All three members of the crew at one point
or another denied that the fecal matter in

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.280
question was theirs during the immediate aftermath,
with the most adamant among them being Stafford,

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.800
who, as mentioned, deflected accusations away
from himself by claiming that his expulsions

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.349
were “more sticky” than the ones currently
invading their space- a bold but otherwise

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:30.509
fine tactic in the Who Smelt It, Dealt It
game.

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:34.240
That said, in an effort to leave no stone
unturned to find out who the culprit was,

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:40.129
we read through the 171 pages of NASA’s
transcript of day six of the Apollo 10 mission

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:42.199
and found a few clues.

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:45.999
We know that earlier that same day Cernan
and Stafford talked about going to the bathroom,

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:49.560
but Young did not, at least as far as we can
find.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.150
However, during the second turd incident,
Young did note in response to one of Stafford’s

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.869
assertions that “Mine was stickier than
that…”, “Mine was too.

00:06:57.869 --> 00:06:58.969
It hit the bag…”

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:03.800
So we can deduce from this that Young did
indeed recently defecate, but likewise asserted

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.360
that his stuck to the bag.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.399
If we are to believe both Young and Stafford
in this, it would seem to rule them out.

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:13.369
A little more evidence in the finger pointing
at Cernan is that he noted after going to

00:07:13.369 --> 00:07:17.659
the bathroom that he couldn’t smell a thing,
suggesting that he’d just gone the big #2

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:22.839
and, at least as far as the transcript reveals,
was the last person to poop before Turdgate

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:24.520
and Turdgate 2: The Reckoning.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.809
(Of course, when exactly Young went to the
bathroom is undocumented, so Young going last

00:07:28.809 --> 00:07:30.389
can’t be wholly ruled out.)

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:34.419
The fact that Cernan’s expulsions weren’t
smelly also is a small strike against him,

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:39.110
with presumably more stinky fecal bits escaping
the bag being more immediately noticeable

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.270
than the springtime fresh variety.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:45.349
It’s also noted that during the second incident,
while Cernan did state, “Here’s another

00:07:45.349 --> 00:07:46.349
godd*&amp;m turd.

00:07:46.349 --> 00:07:47.759
What’s the matter with you guys?”

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:51.099
implying he thought one of the other two was
to blame, both of the others subsequently

00:07:51.099 --> 00:07:53.839
pointed out the sticky nature of their defecations.

00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:57.689
In response to this, Cernan then backtracked
a little, stating, “I don’t know whose

00:07:57.689 --> 00:07:58.689
that is.

00:07:58.689 --> 00:08:00.520
I can neither claim it nor disclaim it.”

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.289
He then laughed.

00:08:02.289 --> 00:08:05.270
Unfortunately the transcript does not give
adequate detail of the laugh.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.759
Was it perhaps a nervous chuckle, with him
knowing deep down he was guilty?

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:12.800
Or was it a general guffaw at the absurdity
of it all- three humans floating around over

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.610
two hundred thousand miles from Earth in one
of the most expensive and advanced pieces

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.539
of engineering ever constructed, orbiting
the Moon while their own fecal matter more

00:08:20.539 --> 00:08:22.240
or less orbited them.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.400
Further research into the solid rear emissions
of the trio, such as the Apollo mission fecal

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.759
sample mass measurements, were unhelpful in
potentially identifying the culprit.

00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:34.750
While none of this provides definitive proof
by any means, based on the scant evidence

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.930
we have to go on, it would seem Cernan is
the most likely source of the offending fecal

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:39.930
matter.

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:42.860
Of course, Stafford was the discoverer of
the first turd and we can only wonder whether

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.140
the “first smeller is the feller” rule
extends to such circumstances as visually

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.340
spotting solid waste in space.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.500
He also was the first, and most adamant, to
deny it could have been him.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.190
Doth protest too much?

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:58.890
On the other hand, Young’s fecal emissions
were decidedly absent from the transcript

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:00.630
logs that fateful day.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:05.089
Was there tampering to protect one of NASA’s
most accomplished astronauts?

00:09:05.089 --> 00:09:08.221
If nothing else, we hope you agree that this
qualifies as a “fun fact” you can use

00:09:08.221 --> 00:09:11.829
to inject yourself into conversation circles
at cocktail parties in order to avoid having

00:09:11.829 --> 00:09:15.569
to be that person who awkwardly hovers just
outside of said circles.

00:09:15.569 --> 00:09:21.230
Arming oneself to avoid such a circumstance
is half the point of Today I Found Out, after

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:22.230
all.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.630
If you thought the Apollo mission fecal matter
containment system was a marvel of engineering,

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.700
you might be interested to know that the LM
urine collection system for various reasons

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.740
had to be pressurized.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.819
To ensure that the astronauts weren’t…

00:09:34.819 --> 00:09:39.199
injured while urinating, it was noted in the
aforementioned Apollo Experience Report that

00:09:39.199 --> 00:09:44.110
“a prime urine-transfer design constraint
for the LM was that the crewmen would be protected

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:45.880
at all times from pressure differentials…”

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.880
This system, however, was a little buggy at
first (though there were never any reported

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.880
injuries).

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:56.060
NASA engineers being NASA engineers, they
worked it out in the end.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:00.050
The oldest surviving large, single deposit
(not found mixed with others and not broken

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:04.889
up) piece of human poop is approximately 1,000
years old, expelled by a Viking.

00:10:04.889 --> 00:10:08.380
This seven inch long piece of fecal matter
is currently on display at the the York Archaeological

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:09.380
Resource Centre.
