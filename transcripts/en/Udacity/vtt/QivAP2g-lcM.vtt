00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.277
Alright! So, let's I mean, what we'd really like to get to

00:00:03.277 --> 00:00:06.298
are algorithms for doing optimization, and I think to do that it's

00:00:06.298 --> 00:00:09.304
helpful to do a quiz. So, here is a little a quiz

00:00:09.304 --> 00:00:13.520
that I put together, I call it Optimize Me. And what I

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.870
want you to do is, is here's two different problems, there's two

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.420
different input spaces, two different functions, and I want you to find

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.630
the optimal x-star or something really close to it, if you can't

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.700
get it exactly right. So, the first question we've got the input

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.590
space x is the values one to 100. And the function that we're trying to optimize

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.030
is x mod 6 squared mod 7 minus the sin of x.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.140
&gt;&gt; Holy cow.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's, it is an awesome looking function. Do you want to

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.420
see it? I, I might be able to plot it for you.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.900
&gt;&gt; Sure, I'd love to see plots, because then

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.980
maybe I'll know how to figure out the answer.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah oh yeah well maybe I should not then,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.442
maybe I should wait until we already have an answer and then yeah,

00:00:54.442 --> 00:00:58.006
let's, let's wait but I'll show you after it. It's, it's, it's crazy.

00:00:58.006 --> 00:00:59.212
&gt;&gt; [Laughs]

00:00:59.212 --> 00:01:03.910
&gt;&gt; Alright it's beautiful. So okay good, so and the

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.870
second problem we've got x as the set of real

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.400
numbers, so all, any, any possible number in the reals.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.700
And the function that we're trying to optimize is negative

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.132
x to the 4th plus 1000x cubed minus 20x squared plus 4x

00:01:19.132 --> 00:01:21.000
minus 6. Alright, so you understand

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.970
the questions? I understand the questions, yes.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.410
&gt;&gt; Good, good luck with them.
