00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.900
Let's add some rational
numbers.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.350
And I'm using that word because
that's the word that

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.640
this book uses, but in more
popular terminology we'll be

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.480
adding fractions.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.100
So let's just go through all
of these, actually, just to

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.080
see all of the examples.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.660
So first we're going to
have 3/7 plus 2/7.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.840
Our denominators are the same,
so we can just add the

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.070
numerators.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.480
So our denominator is
7, 3 plus 2 is 5.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.060
That is a.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.960
Let me do every other.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.290
It would take forever
to do all of them.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.550
Not forever, but just more time
than I want to spend.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.860
So c is 5/16 plus 5/12.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.900
Our denominators are
not the same.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.700
We have to find a common
denominator, which has to be

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.450
the least common-- it actually
could be any common multiple

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.050
of these, but for simplicity
let's do the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.770
least common multiple.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.150
So what's the smallest number
that's a multiple

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.215
of both 16 and 12?

00:00:58.215 --> 00:01:01.700
So let's see, 16 times 2
is 32, not there yet.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.660
Times 3, 48.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.599
That seems to work.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.990
12 goes into 48 four times.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.733
So let's use 48 as our
common denominator.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.415
So we had to multiply 16 times 3
to get to 48, so we're going

00:01:19.415 --> 00:01:23.890
to have to multiply
this 5 times 3.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.670
We're just multiplying the
numerator and the denominator

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.090
by the same number, so we're
not really changing it.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.370
So 5 times 3 is 15.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.850
And then to get from this 12 to
this 48 right there, we had

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.890
to multiply times 4.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.170
So then to get to 5 to this
numerator over here, we have

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.120
to multiply times 4.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.690
5 times 4 is 20.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.980
Now we have the same
denominator.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.180
So this is going to be equal
to, our denominator is 48.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.150
And so we can add 15 plus
20, which is 35.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.670
And can we reduce this?

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.950
Let's see, 5 does
not go into 48.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.620
7 does not go into 48.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.330
It looks like we're all done.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.940
Let's do e right there.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.790
8/25 plus 7 over 10.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.570
Once again, we don't have
a common denominator.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.850
But we can solve that.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.890
Let's make, let's see, 50 is the
smallest number that both

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:29.800
of these go into.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.340
25 times 2, so that's 50.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.050
8 over 25, to go to 50
we multiply by 2.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.990
So the 8, we're going to
have to multiply by 2.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.640
So it's going to
be 16 over 50.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.945
And then the 7 over 10,
we're going to want

00:02:45.945 --> 00:02:47.930
to put it over 50.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.750
We multiply the 10 times
5, so we have to

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.605
multiply the 7 times 5.

00:02:54.605 --> 00:02:57.720
So it's going to
be 35 over 50.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.560
Now that our denominators are
the same, we have it over 50.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.550
16 plus 35, what is that?

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.690
10 plus 35 is 45,
plus 6 is 51.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.770
So it is 51 over 50.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.992
Problem g.

00:03:16.992 --> 00:03:19.700
Let me do it in a new color.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.410
Problem g.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.470
So here we have 7 over 15-- I'll
write the second one in a

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.530
different color--
plus 2 over 9.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.620
Once again, the denominators
are different.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.490
Find a common denominator.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.540
What is the smallest number that
both 15 and 9 go into?

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.260
Let's see, 15 times 2 is 30.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.940
Nope, not divisible by 9.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.670
15 times 3 is 45, that works.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.220
45 is divisible by 9.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.590
So we use 45.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.810
15 times 3 is 45, so
7 times 3 is 21.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.850
These two fractions
are equivalent.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.680
Plus we're going over 45.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.520
To get from 9 to 45, we have
to multiply times 5.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.420
So to get our numerator
over here, we have to

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.980
multiply it times 5.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.420
So 2 times 5 is 10.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.422
2/9 is the same thing
as 10/45.

00:04:22.422 --> 00:04:24.710
So now we can add.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.130
We're adding fractions of 45.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:33.130
21 plus 10 is 31,
and we are done.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.900
Let's do one more problem down
here, a word problem.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.070
Nadia, Peter and Ian are pooling
their money to buy a

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.640
gallon of ice cream.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.630
Nadia's the oldest and gets
the greatest allowance.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.740
She contributes 1/2 the cost.
So Nadia is contributing 1/2

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.750
the cost. So that is
Nadia right there.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.850
Ian is next oldest and
contributes 1/3 of the cost.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.280
So Ian contributes 1/3.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.820
That is Ian.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.360
Peter, the youngest, gets the
smallest allowance and

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:13.730
contributes 1/4 of the cost.
So Peter gives 1/4 of the

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.560
cost. Peter contributes
1/4 of cost.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.920
They figure that this will
be enough money.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.480
When they get to the checkout,
they realize that they forgot

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.000
about sales tax and
worry there will

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.340
not be enough money.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.370
Amazingly, they have exactly
the right amount of money.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.460
What fraction of the cost of
ice cream was added as tax?

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.640
Well, let's see, if we add 1/2
plus 1/3, plus 1/4 of the

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.640
cost, let's see what we get.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.100
So we have to find a common
denominator, some number that

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.250
is the least common multiple
of 2, 3, and 4.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.970
And let's see, 4, it would
have to be 12, right?

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.150
12 is divisible by 2, it's
divisible by 3, and it's

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.400
divisible by 4.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.480
So 1/2 is the same
thing as 6/12.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.750
2 times 6 is 12.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.420
1 times 6 is 6.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.240
These are equivalent.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.720
6 is 1/2 of 12.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.440
1/3, if we use 12 as a common
denominator, to go from 3 to

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.570
12 you have to multiply by 4.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.190
So you take that 4 and
you multiply it by 1.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.620
4/12 is the same thing as 1/3.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:24.280
And then 1/4, if you use your
denominator 12, to go from 4

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.410
to 12 you have to multiply by
3, so multiply the numerator

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.080
by 3 as well, you get 3.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.360
So let's add these.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.660
So 6/12 plus 4/12, plus 3/12 is
going to be equal to-- our

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.670
denominator's going to be 12--
it's going to be 6 plus 4,

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:47.560
plus 3, which is equal to 6 plus
4 is 10, plus 3 is 13.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.980
So it's going to be
equal to 13/12.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.000
And this is as an improper
fraction.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.950
Or we could say that this is the
same thing, this is equal

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:02.880
to 12/12 plus 1/12, or we could
say the same thing as

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.420
12/12 is just 1, right?

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.770
12 divided by 12 is 1.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.050
So this is 1 and 1/12.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.950
So when they pool their money,
they get 1 and 1/12 of the

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:19.180
price of the ice cream that
they want to buy.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.480
So they say what fraction of
the cost of ice cream was

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.310
added as tax?

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.620
This is the exact amount that
they needed to pay.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.740
So clearly, 1 is the non-taxed
price of the ice cream, so

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.760
this 1/12 was the amount
added as tax.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.740
So the answer to the question
is 1/12 of the price

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.290
was added as tax.
