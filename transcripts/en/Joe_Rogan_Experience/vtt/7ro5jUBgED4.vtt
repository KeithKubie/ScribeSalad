WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.820
Club that comes from our famous
Chicago.

2
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.340
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight.

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.170
If you go to Joe rogan.net don't have to give you one of them.

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.000
I never did right now.
We gave you one.
Uh,

5
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.380
I bought my own [inaudible] you had the uh,

6
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.650
you never gave me one.
No.

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.350
Did you tell the story on the podcast ever did I did?
Yeah,
I did.
Yeah.

8
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.940
That's a good flashlight story.
But we can tell the same story twice.
Yeah.

9
00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:32.910
Some girl basically Clifton all grow wouldn't fuck him.
He took her to a,

10
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.570
a porn shop.
I bought a flashlight while she was staying with them.

11
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.700
It's hilarious.
And then that's the worst feeling in the world.

12
00:00:40.701 --> 00:00:42.930
We are like really attract to a chicken really into her.

13
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.320
And then you come like whether you jerk off or something and then you just like

14
00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:50.640
what?
Posted on syndrome.
[inaudible] Syndrome.
[inaudible] syndrome is huge,
man.

15
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.840
That's life changing shit.
You realize how much your Dick is kidnapping your,

16
00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:59.580
your whole brain.
You don't learn that Shit Til like 20 or thirties.

17
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.570
And when you finally figured out you got kids,
you got finally figured out,

18
00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:08.250
Oh shit.
Like no matter how much you think you want to fuck a chick,
man,

19
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.260
when you bust that nut,
the truth comes out.
And she said,
you remember that bit?

20
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.130
You had one of the big long bus.
Yeah,
yeah.

21
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.280
That's what it's like when you dig is hard.

22
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.710
When you're in normal life to bit was like in normal life you're driving,
you're,

23
00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:22.890
you're in control.
You're at the wheel.

24
00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:24.990
You decide which way you go when your Dick is hard.

25
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.770
It's like you're sitting in the backseat of a really long bus and then some

26
00:01:28.771 --> 00:01:31.400
other dude up there and driving is way the fuck up there.

27
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.550
And he could barely talk to him as long as,
eh,
all this noise.
And you're like,

28
00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:37.170
do you even know where you're going?

29
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.570
You'll shut the fuck up and sit up.
And He'd just go,
oh,
this guy's a dick.

30
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:47.180
I'm just going to go to sleep and post nuts.
Syndromal well,
you know,
once you,

31
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.130
you figure it out,
it's like a,

32
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.370
it's almost like a trick is total trick because if you're not in like

33
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.590
maintenance mode,
if you're not taking care of yourself,

34
00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:58.530
you're not jerking off on a regular basis.
You can get frantic.

35
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.440
Like guys can get frantic.
Like someone needs to touch my deck.

36
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.730
Somebody needs to try to predict.

37
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.750
Like if you go like a couple of weeks without beating off and then you're around

38
00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:09.360
someone you're attracted to,
it's we literally become insane.

39
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.410
He become like an insane person.
Man.
I don't know how many times I've,

40
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.690
I could have banged a chick now,
this is when I was single,
my single years.
Uh,

41
00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:22.170
I could have banged a chick and I thought about the Postman Syndrome and I

42
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:24.570
thought,
you know what?
I really,
really,
really want to fuck her right now,

43
00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:29.200
but dammit,
let me just jerk off.
You bust a nut.
You're like,
Dang God,
thank God,

44
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.020
thank God I didn't call that like right away.
You know,
that'll cure you.

45
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.810
You drink.
If you jerk off and you still want to see the check,

46
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.950
then you read lagger in love.
Yeah.
You really like,

47
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.600
or if you bust a nut and you don't want to throw her out the fucking window,

48
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.480
you probably like her.
Do you want to go get some lunch?

49
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.250
If you want to go get lunch after you bust them,

50
00:02:47.251 --> 00:02:49.760
not you want to go watch a movie or something you really liked.

51
00:02:49.761 --> 00:02:53.700
It is a real problem in relationships that nobody wants to own up to and that

52
00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:58.200
problem is that women are essentially drug dealers and that drug is pussy and

53
00:02:58.201 --> 00:03:00.640
it's the best Raga Earth.
It's,

54
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.160
you know when you're horny and you're getting some posts and you're like,

55
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.760
I can't even believe I'm getting pussy here.
When you're having sex,
you're like,

56
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:11.090
I can't believe this is even happening because you wanted it so bad and you,

57
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.670
especially if you've been on a dry spell,

58
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.720
like what's your longest dry spell like in high school and shit.
Ever.

59
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.750
Ever in life.
Damn Dude.
I don't know.
That's a long time.

60
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.630
I used to work at a strip club.
There wasn't that many dry spells.

61
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.040
I had a six month one when I was 19 it was devastating.
That was a long one.

62
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.400
Then when you're a teenager,

63
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.910
I remember the dry spells being so long thinking man I like,

64
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:37.300
I would fantasize about what the next girl I'm gonna fuck would look like and

65
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.240
what you're going to be like.
Is it going to be six months?

66
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.620
Is it going to be a year and a half?

67
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.070
I mean I would think like it was like a fantasy thing,
you know like

68
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.680
that was way back in the day.

69
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.340
Way Back in the day before you discovered this is a place where they grow.

70
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.140
They just grow on trees over here.
You know in high school you get to know girls,

71
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:57.850
you get to meet girls,
you know you date,

72
00:03:57.851 --> 00:04:00.220
but once you get out of high school if you're not,

73
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:04.060
you know you're not in college.
Like my first year of college out of high school,

74
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:07.360
I didn't do anything.
I just work my first year before I went to school again.

75
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.310
And that was when I just went through my most devastating ever drought cause

76
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:15.490
like I'm never around girls.
So you have no chance.
Yeah.

77
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:19.930
It sucks for people that are like that work at places where there's no checks.

78
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.680
You're there all day and then you live in a town where there's hardly no chicks

79
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.200
in those towns where if there's a hot chick in town,

80
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.550
by the time she's 16 dudes are already proposing and like locked in.

81
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.580
There's no way you're going to go into a small town and there's going to be a

82
00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:41.020
super hottie that's 22,
that single no,
good luck.

83
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.250
Small town.
No good luck.
Somebody to college down.
Yes.
Unless she just broke up.

84
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.480
And then even then the dude's still coming around the house yelling drunk at

85
00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:54.060
night.
You need,
Dude's just knocked those bitches out.
Fuck it.
Let's just,

86
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.090
they don't want to even,

87
00:04:55.091 --> 00:04:57.880
cause they know everyone around them is trying to get a piece of that.

88
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.390
This is supposed to be a commercial for the question.
I think it's still going.

89
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.950
So,
uh,
so that's where in the code name Rogan and get 15% off.
Well,
this,

90
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.410
it all comes back fleshlight well,
this,

91
00:05:08.411 --> 00:05:10.900
we've been doing commercials like this and people have been complaining because

92
00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:13.540
they're so long.
But I'm like,
but it's sort of not even really a commercial.

93
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:15.460
I mean,
it's a commercial.
I'm talking about the flashlight,

94
00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:19.000
but we're also just talking,
you know,
it's organic.

95
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.070
Instead of me reading some canned bullshit,

96
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.040
you only can bullshit part is a part where I got to say,
you know,

97
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.230
15% off entering the codename Rogan.
I should that every time.
You know,

98
00:05:27.231 --> 00:05:31.480
it'd be cool for the fleshlight is if they sold like mannequins that you could

99
00:05:31.481 --> 00:05:35.470
just like,
just stick the flashlight and,
and fucking you in when you're done.

100
00:05:35.471 --> 00:05:39.410
You Paul fleshlight out just like a real doll.
Yeah.
But it's just,

101
00:05:39.411 --> 00:05:40.244
it's sitting up,

102
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.800
there's one bent over and you just like stick that bless light and hit it.

103
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.710
You know what I mean?
Definitely help with that.
Even help.
I mean,

104
00:05:47.711 --> 00:05:49.450
how much can you use your imagination?

105
00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:52.810
Can you really pretend that that's a person?
I think that would help.
Yeah,

106
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.350
I think it would help because then you cause you actually fuck it and stick your

107
00:05:56.351 --> 00:05:59.720
hand nuts feel different when you're thrusting.
Yeah,

108
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.050
totally feel different when you're trusting them.
More impact behind them.
Yeah.

109
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.990
The sensation is,
is like 20% difference just ran out.
Coma patients.

110
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.530
Oh boy.
They used to have a joke about the Veggie hookers,

111
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.960
like super low cost hookers.
They're like vegetables and you just

112
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.960
like,
how much would a vegetable because you know to help pay for the,

113
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.720
it's not cheap.
It's not cheap.
You know,
keeping him on life support.
Yeah,

114
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.910
that's what I'm,
you know what I mean?

115
00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:32.510
For the hospital because they don't have insurance.
They have no choice.

116
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.020
Dude.
Veggie hookers,
it'd be like five bucks and they deliver them.

117
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:40.100
Do you like as a dude?

118
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:45.220
Wheels admitted in a hospital going to hire somebody to clean them all day in

119
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.260
between sessions.
They couldn't tell on you.

120
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:50.780
That would have to be somebody watching and make sure you don't abuse them.

121
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.920
Put cigarettes out.
Hey,
you know what?
Cause otherwise hookers can complain.

122
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.630
That can't even talk.
We can't even talk.
So maybe somebody else

123
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.540
she can move your eyes was like,
fuck yeah,

124
00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:07.790
this guy says creepy shit to her while shooting in.

125
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.320
Imagine pulling trains on Veggie hookers,
cod.

126
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.870
Oh,
you gotta do what?
You got to get better.

127
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.440
It's better than jerking off,
right?
No,
no,
no.

128
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:24.960
Cause you're thinking about this poor paralyzed person.
Yeah.
The puss,

129
00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:28.040
that syndrome would be so big.
Just dress him up.

130
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:30.770
They'll put like sunglasses on him and like a nice like,
you know,

131
00:07:30.771 --> 00:07:33.920
nightgown or so what's fucked up?
Told them,
you know,

132
00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:38.880
there's somebody that I know there's somebody that's into that,
you know,
there's,

133
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.880
there's gotta be gotta be this gotta be Brian.
Um,

134
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.180
they asked him to do a fucking video where him and his girl are tied up.
Yeah.

135
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.790
I tie him up in film,
struggling to get free.

136
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:53.510
Like if we were kidnapped together and we're in fucking imagine them am still

137
00:07:53.511 --> 00:07:55.010
thinking about it,
but I think it might do it myself.

138
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.520
How much they should find out what everybody who wants and fire.
Amen.

139
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.660
Okay.
They should find out anybody,
anybody who buys those videos,

140
00:08:02.661 --> 00:08:04.800
they should follow that motherfucker.
You know,

141
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.420
find out where he gets his duct tape when he uses it on.

142
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:10.640
What the fuck is going on here?
That's what you're buying.

143
00:08:10.641 --> 00:08:13.130
You're buying videos at dude's tied up with their girl.

144
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.200
The fuck on a weird ideas that you have in your head.

145
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:20.470
You have to be tied up and your girl damn well she gets 500 I get 400 but how do

146
00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:26.710
you know this guy's to fucking untie you?
I didn't know this guy's [inaudible],

147
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.920
but what I'm saying is I company,
yeah,
it's a porn porn or now a bondage company.

148
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:34.700
Jesus Christ.
Oh shit son.
Where did you go?
Wrong site.

149
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.920
And what I'm thinking is like,
dude,
I could just fill them up myself,

150
00:08:36.921 --> 00:08:40.040
make it better and then just throw it like on clips for sale.com or whatever and

151
00:08:40.041 --> 00:08:44.210
just,
I'm sure when people sell that direct membership,

152
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.950
like a subscription link to all the creepy fuck yeah.
You know,

153
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.040
they have their email addresses,

154
00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:51.770
they can just send them out to all the creepy fucks up by their bondage videos

155
00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:56.010
right away.
You have to find that market anyway.
We're

156
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.660
<v 1>also sponsored by ana.com.
Makers of Alpha brain.
This is the longest.</v>

157
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:05.730
This is the last one ever.
So Alpha brain is a cognitive enhancing supplement.

158
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.130
We also have new mood,
which is a five HTP and l trip to fan supplement.

159
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.480
Five HTP or a lot of controversy.
Man,

160
00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:16.170
a lot of people use it as an antidepressant.
And a,
um,

161
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:19.920
a buddy of mine who was on it,
actually,
Neil Brennan was on it and he,
he's,
uh,

162
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.070
he talked about on the podcast and he,
um,

163
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.920
his doctor told him to not take it anymore,

164
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.370
not take the five HTP because essentially what he was doing was taking two

165
00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:33.340
antidepressants,
which I thought was really interesting,
you know?
Yeah.

166
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:38.420
As doctor told them to stay on these fucking medic medication instead of these

167
00:09:38.551 --> 00:09:41.280
natural herbs that work just as good that you can get without a prescription.

168
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.880
I mean,
that's really essentially what you're saying.
I mean,
five HTP is a,

169
00:09:44.881 --> 00:09:47.600
you can get it in any health food store.
Right.
You know,
it's a common up.

170
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.850
<v 2>So what happens is you get to then is the credit card companies scared that</v>

171
00:09:51.851 --> 00:09:55.150
you'd like cancel all your credit cards are like,
well the Pharmaceutical Cup,

172
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:56.940
<v 1>but he's scared that you're not going to pay for their shit anymore.</v>

173
00:09:56.941 --> 00:10:01.050
You're not gonna pay for Prozac or Zoloft steady going to pay for five HTP.

174
00:10:01.051 --> 00:10:03.690
It's really interesting.
I don't know,
obviously I don't,

175
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.010
I don't take an antidepressant,

176
00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:07.260
so obviously I don't know what the effect of either one of them has,

177
00:10:07.261 --> 00:10:11.700
but I do know that for me,
who doesn't need an antidepressant?

178
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.590
Five HTP is nice.
I like it.

179
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.010
Neil Neil Brennan turned me onto it first and then this with the difference

180
00:10:17.011 --> 00:10:18.870
between five HTP,
normal in this new mood,

181
00:10:18.871 --> 00:10:21.420
stuff that we're selling is they would also have el trip to fan in it,

182
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.930
which breaks down to Serotonin's like the building blocks

183
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.350
<v 2>for Turkey,
five HTP.</v>

184
00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:29.770
So what makes you tired and Turkey and I just remembered that and I just took

185
00:10:29.771 --> 00:10:32.980
two and now I'm going to be,
you'll be fine.
You'll be fine.
You'll be fine.

186
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:34.900
I take them before I go to sleep though.

187
00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:38.470
Remember that was a sketch to for [inaudible] syndrome was like Zoloft that you

188
00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:40.570
take when you're fucking a chick that you know that you know,

189
00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.530
you take the pill and you don't take her out to lunch,

190
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.620
they'll catch a movie eventually they're going to have pills that recreate

191
00:10:47.621 --> 00:10:50.730
orgasms.
You know they're going to have pills.
That isn't that,

192
00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:51.970
that's almost ecstasy.

193
00:10:51.971 --> 00:10:54.850
They almost got sort of right actually on the right there on the right track.

194
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.410
Probably better

195
00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.030
<v 1>in the mind.
Just you don't feel it in your deck.
You know,</v>

196
00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:03.390
it's like a better feeling almost when you're on ecstasy then coming except your

197
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:08.310
Dick doesn't get the wild ride.
Right.
Does that make sense?
Um,
anyway,

198
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:12.780
go to [inaudible] dot com enter the Code Day Rogan and you get 10% off.

199
00:11:12.781 --> 00:11:15.330
We also have a shroom tech sport which I got to give you.

200
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.000
It's based on a quarter steps mushroom and it's a,

201
00:11:18.001 --> 00:11:21.450
an endurance Sapa and it's nice,
it gives you energy man,

202
00:11:21.451 --> 00:11:25.350
but not like not wild energy like a coffee or anything like that.

203
00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:27.600
And it gives you like a smooth,
steady energy.

204
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:29.790
The Chinese Olympics team started using it.

205
00:11:29.791 --> 00:11:32.160
There's a bunch of different cordyceps mushroom supplements out there.

206
00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:34.290
They'll again,
endurance enhancing supplements.

207
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:39.390
<v 2>Can I use that to get on?
What about the Germans?
What are they using?</v>

208
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.850
I don't know.
Chinese to do too well,
and they love bags.

209
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.140
I shouldn't say that.
First of all,
the Cambodian,
they're listening.

210
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.230
They're listening.
They're going to get angry.
You know what?

211
00:11:49.231 --> 00:11:53.860
Chinese are wrangling gymnastics.
Oh Shit.
Those,
Oh yeah.

212
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.540
<v 0>But uh,
they don't feel well with a basketball.</v>

213
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:04.000
Football,
football,
football.
Mexicans even do better than Chinese and football.

214
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.010
At least we got one Mexican in there right now.

215
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.490
There's a Mexican playing football.
One Guy Sanchez.

216
00:12:09.491 --> 00:12:11.260
He's the quarterback for the jets.
We got one dude.

217
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:16.390
How many dudes do you think a train is that like a killer thing?

218
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.750
Fuck Mexicans love football.
They're just too small.

219
00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.770
So it was just made it,
I mean,

220
00:12:23.771 --> 00:12:26.380
I figured that out in the ninth grade when I got to ninth grade,
I'm like,

221
00:12:26.381 --> 00:12:31.360
God damn does the end of this commercial and the music

222
00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:38.140
experience [inaudible] those along.

223
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.740
But whatever.
It's not really commercial telling you some stories in there.
Right.

224
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:52.150
Some shit going down and he did sample edgy.
Bravo.

225
00:12:52.151 --> 00:12:55.960
My friend Eddie Bravo is here.
Thank you for having me.
Thank you.

226
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:58.720
Joe Diaz was supposed to be here with us,
but Joe Rogan,

227
00:12:58.721 --> 00:13:01.000
I got the other things I gotta do.
I'm going to be there at nine o'clock.

228
00:13:01.001 --> 00:13:04.450
I'm going to be there at nine o'clock so Joey will be here when we do another

229
00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:08.410
podcast.
Actually never.
He actually never agreed to do it.
He never did it.
Yeah.

230
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.570
I thought he was going to do it.
I twittered it.

231
00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.660
I tweeted it and he calls me up and tells him like,
man,

232
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:16.840
you don't know anything unless you're talking to me.
I'm like,
Oh shit.

233
00:13:16.841 --> 00:13:21.430
I thought I did agree to it.
He agreed it to me.
Joey's crazy.
It's okay.

234
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.510
You got,
I got things I gotta do dog.
Yeah.
You know what?

235
00:13:25.511 --> 00:13:26.700
I shouldn't have jumped the gun now.

236
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.460
I shouldn't have jumped the gun and tweeting it.
Yeah,
because he,

237
00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.450
cause everyone laughs.
Everybody's scared.
Joey's got everybody.

238
00:13:32.451 --> 00:13:34.480
Security can even tweet things that you said he would do.

239
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:38.810
What the fuck you're doing?
What the fuck did I tell you to tweak that?

240
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:44.170
The fuck you do tweet tweeting that he's the best though.
I fucked.
I don't mind.

241
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.120
No,
you didn't fuck up.

242
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.710
You fucked up in the world of Joey and the regular world where you did was

243
00:13:47.711 --> 00:13:49.240
normal.
He told me he was going to do it.

244
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.510
He then he said to me on the phone today,
do you want me to do these things dog,

245
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.450
you gotta talk to me a day before I did talk to you Dave,

246
00:13:54.451 --> 00:13:55.840
before we talked about it yesterday.

247
00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:59.680
But you know these Joey d hopefully he comes tonight.
He's going to come tonight.

248
00:13:59.681 --> 00:14:00.850
He just doesn't want to be here all day.

249
00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.500
But you know when he might not come tonight.

250
00:14:02.501 --> 00:14:04.210
I mean he reserves the right to not show up.

251
00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:10.270
That's done twice or three times.
Yeah,
he just doesn't show up sometimes.

252
00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.200
Luckily it doesn't matter.
He's so,
he's such a wild motherfucker.

253
00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.970
That's why you like him cause he's so random.
It doesn't matter.

254
00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.920
He could flake on three shows.
Four shows you still love them?
Well,
it took me,

255
00:14:20.921 --> 00:14:25.630
no,
not really that long to realize that you don't get a personality like that

256
00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:28.600
without some quirks,
you know?
Uh,
personally,
I mean,

257
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.530
that's just the impulsiveness of the reason why it's so funny.
You know,

258
00:14:32.531 --> 00:14:36.950
it's all just his,
his own special blend,
his own special personality,
you know,

259
00:14:36.951 --> 00:14:37.570
let's just,
uh,

260
00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:41.050
he's just an unusual dude and you gotta accept that you've got to let him be who

261
00:14:41.051 --> 00:14:43.540
he is.
That's why I started taking two comics on the road with me.

262
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.650
I used to only take one,
but that one was Joey.
A lot of time and a lot of time,

263
00:14:47.651 --> 00:14:52.000
Joe,
who just fucking,
he just would vanish on you.
And

264
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.110
<v 1>so I started taking other dudes.
Yeah.</v>

265
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:57.350
So it became two and then I realized when you take two,
it's more fun anyway,

266
00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.190
you know,
becomes like a party,
you know,
like one dude is good,

267
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.500
but when you go on the road with like two,
three dudes,

268
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.230
that's when it becomes really fun.
You know,
it doesn't feel bad.

269
00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:07.890
And like when we go on the road,
you,

270
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.330
Eddie should go on the road with us all the time for years,
for years,

271
00:15:11.331 --> 00:15:15.170
and when we would go on the road,
you know,
it never felt like we weren't home.

272
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.920
It just,
we had different places where we slept,
but everything else is the same,

273
00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:22.700
was just all our friends going out to eat,
all our friends,
you know,

274
00:15:22.701 --> 00:15:25.460
drinking or whatever.
All our friends at the shows,

275
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:28.940
it seems to me like we were just hanging out,
which is beautiful,
but you never,

276
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.421
you know,

277
00:15:29.421 --> 00:15:33.320
you don't get that horrible fucking loneliness that a lot of comics get when

278
00:15:33.321 --> 00:15:37.220
they go on the road.
Man.
They just,
them alone in a hotel room after the show,

279
00:15:37.221 --> 00:15:41.750
just wishing they were home,
missing their girl,
missing their dog,

280
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.220
just desperate.

281
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:46.730
There's a lot of dudes gets fucking seriously depressed from road traveling.

282
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.760
I can imagine,
man,
I hate being gone just for two or three days.

283
00:15:49.761 --> 00:15:52.670
Can you imagine being like I Heffron that's like gone for like a whole month

284
00:15:52.671 --> 00:15:54.740
almost something.
He's crying.
He doesn't bring guys with them.

285
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.880
He's not going with a bunch of his buddies and guys with them.

286
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.313
Why does it sound good?

287
00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:04.250
Actually it's on a non gay guy and he doesn't bring guys with them.

288
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:09.800
Yes.
I don't know why I even thought like that.
Sad,
sad.

289
00:16:09.801 --> 00:16:10.461
You would think that way.

290
00:16:10.461 --> 00:16:13.220
That's where all this Todd comics either comics out there,

291
00:16:13.221 --> 00:16:16.040
they're like bring checks with them everywhere they go.
Sure.
Yeah,
yeah,

292
00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:19.490
absolutely.
There's one shot or something.
There's one comic that did our podcast.

293
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.940
I knew it was going to bring his fucking wife.
He brings her everywhere.
Dude.

294
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:24.320
I've never seen him without her.

295
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:27.530
She's really hot and he's really not and he's like,
I got this bitch.

296
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:31.640
She ain't going nowhere.
And he just brings her everywhere.
Everywhere they go.

297
00:16:31.641 --> 00:16:34.310
And he brought her on the podcast and she,
we had to get her a microphone.

298
00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.550
She was talking.
So wait,
hold on.
I'm going to turn the microphone.

299
00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:42.260
It's like she kept on talking off mic.
So it was constant,
like just,
here's my,

300
00:16:42.261 --> 00:16:46.160
yeah,
it was,
well it wasn't,
it wasn't reluctant.
I like her.
She's nice.
She's,

301
00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.740
you know,
she's not stupid.
She's smart person,
but it's just,

302
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.570
he's just one of those dudes that just can't,

303
00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:54.320
he doesn't go anywhere without his girl.
Yeah.
People do that man.

304
00:16:54.321 --> 00:16:57.290
Probably listening to the show and that's okay.
We didn't say anything bad.

305
00:16:57.291 --> 00:16:59.270
It's all true.
He's a great guy.
I love him.

306
00:16:59.420 --> 00:16:59.930
<v 3>Hey Eddie,</v>

307
00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:04.430
I did you release a new music video recently or have you released it yet or

308
00:17:04.431 --> 00:17:06.050
what's going on with that?
That music video?

309
00:17:06.051 --> 00:17:09.160
We were going to release it last week,
but it turns out it's,

310
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.470
there's still some color colorization left to do some technical shit,

311
00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:17.360
but we're going to drop it,
uh,
Travie first or second week of December.
Awesome.

312
00:17:17.361 --> 00:17:20.510
We're going to have,
but I can't wait to see it.
It's,
it's pretty dope man.

313
00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.950
What's the song?
It's Jujitsu.
Did you redo the song's called Jujitsu?

314
00:17:24.951 --> 00:17:28.040
The song's called Dj.
Did you Redo the whole song?
Did you,

315
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.050
cause you had an original song right now.
Did you redo it or what,
what,

316
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:33.460
what did you change?
What happened?
Um,

317
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.040
Rocka who is a rapper for dilated peoples?

318
00:17:37.041 --> 00:17:40.820
He does Jujitsu with Hannah and Hiran and we had a mutual friend,

319
00:17:40.821 --> 00:17:43.910
his name was um,
a DC and he's like,
dude man,

320
00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.990
I'm going to Hook you on rock up together.
You guys make music together.

321
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.910
We kept talking about it for like a year would call me.
He goes,

322
00:17:49.911 --> 00:17:54.180
well weren't Hollywood where you at?
I wasn't there.
Then after a year he finally,

323
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:59.130
we finally link up,
he ends up at my studio and I,
you know,

324
00:17:59.131 --> 00:18:00.780
I had some songs,
I was gonna you know,
some,

325
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:02.220
some tracks I was going to play for them.

326
00:18:02.221 --> 00:18:04.890
I had three of them and he was going to choose which one he wanted to throw a

327
00:18:04.891 --> 00:18:07.230
verse over and that was the first plan.
But like,
you know,

328
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.740
what do we sing about or what does the song going to be about?
And I thought,

329
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.570
you know,
since he's here,

330
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.480
cause the Dessa kept going to do you know what's happening.
That's,

331
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:19.270
he's deep with the Gracies with hunter and Horian on or all of them and your 10

332
00:18:19.271 --> 00:18:22.800
planet,
you guys coming together with music and he's like,
is it a big deal?

333
00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.300
And I thought,
well,
why don't we,
why doesn't the song just be called Jujitsu?

334
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:30.450
We just,
uh,
you know,
any rat dude,
I don't know if you heard it,
but,
no,

335
00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.990
that is his verse.
When he dropped it played him some beats.
He,

336
00:18:33.991 --> 00:18:38.110
it took him about 45 minutes to write the verses,
boom.
And then compel her.

337
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.980
The guy that gets in my band,
who I always work with an Alex,

338
00:18:40.981 --> 00:18:43.890
were on the side working on adverse verse two,
so that we ended up just going,

339
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.680
why don't you tee rocket,
take the first verse,
compel it,

340
00:18:46.681 --> 00:18:49.600
took the second and Alex did the third.
And

341
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:53.730
<v 0>will it be fun for people who don't do Jujitsu?
Do you think about that?</v>

342
00:18:53.731 --> 00:18:55.220
You just say,
fuck it.
Let's just do it.
For us,

343
00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:59.840
<v 3>it's,
it's really all about,
you know,
the,
to me,
my opinion,</v>

344
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:02.700
the best music is when it's personal.
When it's like,

345
00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.950
if you're trying to write a to,
you know,
so that people can relate to it.

346
00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:11.420
That's in my case at an,
in my opinion,
I think that that's garbage.

347
00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.180
I think that's how it is.
Everything.
Yeah.
You gotta write,
you gotta end.

348
00:19:14.181 --> 00:19:16.670
It was just perfect because that's what it was about.
He showed up and were like,

349
00:19:16.671 --> 00:19:20.390
man,
it is the Gracies rep 10 planet coming together.

350
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:25.450
So the song is about bearing like any kind of negative emotions or negative

351
00:19:26.631 --> 00:19:29.720
energy that there is with 10 planted in the,
let's just bury that shit.

352
00:19:29.721 --> 00:19:32.990
It's all about Jujitsu.
We love it.
And it's,
you know,
and that's,

353
00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:37.320
that's how we ended up doing a music video for it.
And Ken Mau edited it and,

354
00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:42.020
and he made it look really damn good man.
Um,
he,
he's done.

355
00:19:42.021 --> 00:19:46.940
He was,
he's dead.
Beyonce videos.
Jay Z foo fighters.
Anybody you could think of.

356
00:19:46.941 --> 00:19:51.470
He want an MTV music award for crazy by GNARLS Barkley.
That was awesome.

357
00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.140
Cut that video.
Wow.
He got cut.
He cut.

358
00:19:54.141 --> 00:19:57.250
He's like the baddest motherfucker on the business and he cut my video.

359
00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.070
<v 0>That was one of my favorite walkin music's ever.</v>

360
00:20:00.071 --> 00:20:02.230
When Bj Penn came into that song,
I'm like,

361
00:20:02.231 --> 00:20:05.110
how perfect is that for Bj [inaudible] you can hear the audio.

362
00:20:05.111 --> 00:20:09.640
We released the audio,
the,
I'm the songs actually we mean me and rocket did it.

363
00:20:09.641 --> 00:20:14.200
And then I got Danny loaner from nine inch nails.
He,
he actually produced it.

364
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:16.930
Was that like,
was that like a dream come true getting Danny?
Cause that's,

365
00:20:16.931 --> 00:20:19.930
I mean I,
both of us were huge nine inch nails fan still are.

366
00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:23.760
I mean nine inch nails was like,
that's my,
that's my blood and here I am.
Yeah.

367
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.840
<v 3>You know,
working with Danny Loner,
it's pretty fucking crazy.</v>

368
00:20:26.841 --> 00:20:28.890
Every time I'm at his house,
he's got a student in high school,

369
00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:31.850
like a castle mansion up in Hollywood hills and I'm sitting there and we're

370
00:20:31.851 --> 00:20:36.200
working on some shit.
It's,
you know,
it's just,

371
00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.230
it's awesome.
Finally,
after all this time,

372
00:20:39.231 --> 00:20:42.980
getting the respect to them in the music business that,
that I wanted,
you know,

373
00:20:42.981 --> 00:20:46.220
and it was hard cause most people thought I was an athlete,

374
00:20:46.221 --> 00:20:48.100
a Jujitsu guy who

375
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.820
<v 4>is dabbling in music now,
like Oscar de la Hoya or like,
you know,</v>

376
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:52.870
Shaq or something.

377
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.620
They don't realize that I started Jujitsu at 24 and I've been producing music my

378
00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.560
whole life.
That's was the number one goal.

379
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.810
Jujitsu with just a way to stay in shape.

380
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.330
And most people don't realize realize that so they have,

381
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:08.200
they have a prejudice against my music.
Then I didn't want to hear the music.

382
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.120
Oh my God,
you get two guys trying to do music now.

383
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.500
They don't realize that this is what,

384
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.420
this is what I'm really good at now it though,

385
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:18.490
I mean there's a reason why they say that and it's because almost everybody only

386
00:21:18.491 --> 00:21:21.880
does one thing good.
And they'll go and do something else and it sucks.
You know,

387
00:21:21.881 --> 00:21:25.480
like how many times there's an actor put out an album and it's fucking terrible.

388
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:30.250
The odds,
the odds.
I mean,
I understand.
So I understand the odds.
I mean,

389
00:21:30.251 --> 00:21:33.680
I wouldn't,
I mean,
you remember when Michael Jordan tried to play baseball?
Yeah.

390
00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:35.690
You know what I'm saying?
I remember that.
Yep.

391
00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:39.510
<v 2>Barely.
Yeah.
It didn't last long,
right?
It was everyone.
Don Johnson was a singer.</v>

392
00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.510
I went,
Don Johnson was a senator.
Don Johnson had songs.

393
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:45.710
<v 4>Yeah,
currently are terrible.
They were terrible.</v>

394
00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.320
The audio is actually available now.
The,
the video,

395
00:21:48.321 --> 00:21:50.570
we're not going to drop for a couple of weeks.
It's almost done.

396
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:55.630
The audio is available@reverbnation.com slash smoke serpent.

397
00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:59.330
That's the name of the band,
smoke serpent.
So we got a couple songs on there.

398
00:21:59.331 --> 00:22:04.190
The 2011 version of dropped,
which is pretty dope as well.

399
00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:08.690
But um,
the video will be allowed to call your own stuff.
Dope.
Fuck yeah.

400
00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.370
You have to be careful about that now.
Now when it,
when it comes down,
you know,

401
00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.680
every band,
when their album comes out,
they go,
man,
this is our best shit.

402
00:22:15.681 --> 00:22:20.280
It's awesome you,
no one ever says,
man,
my new album's coming out.
It's,
it's I,
no,

403
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.060
no,
no.
I know what I'm saying at all.
I'm saying,
you know,
you,
it's,

404
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:27.740
it's hard to judge your own shit without looking strange,
isn't it?

405
00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:32.600
Isn't that hard to,
no,
not music.
It is the comedy.
It's comedy.
You know,
you say,

406
00:22:32.601 --> 00:22:35.090
I did.
This is my best stuff ever.
But that's about it.

407
00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.690
If you're getting in any more detail and say it's fucking awesome,
it cracks,

408
00:22:38.691 --> 00:22:42.420
it sizzles.
Music's different.
It pops.
Yeah.
Music's different.
Really.
Yeah,

409
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:46.280
for sure.
Well,
it's also maybe because you work with a bunch of people too.

410
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:47.690
It's like a collaborative effort.

411
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:51.650
Whereas with comedy you just kind of bragging about yourself.
Yep.
You know,

412
00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.770
that's tricky,
right?
Yeah.
But yeah,
I mean,

413
00:22:54.771 --> 00:22:57.230
do you ever make a video and tell everybody how awesome it is?

414
00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:01.710
<v 2>I never say it's awesome,
but I definitely just go,
hey,
watch my video.</v>

415
00:23:01.711 --> 00:23:04.260
But I don't think I ever say,
you know,
like,
oh my God,

416
00:23:04.261 --> 00:23:06.110
this is the best video I've ever made.
Or something like that.

417
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:11.120
Video dominates this videos with music that's a little bit more personal and

418
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:14.280
also it's a bunch of people together,
right?
Yeah,
yeah.

419
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:18.630
<v 4>Project.
Yeah.
I'm always real careful about any,</v>

420
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:23.520
any grandiose exclamations about anything that I do.

421
00:23:23.521 --> 00:23:25.800
Cause it always feels like if I talk about it at all,

422
00:23:25.801 --> 00:23:29.670
it makes me feel like a Douche bag.
Yeah,
I understand what music though.
It's,

423
00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:33.480
you gotta be super confident with your music and you know,

424
00:23:33.481 --> 00:23:38.010
without blowing smoke up your own ass.
I actually believe the music that,
that,

425
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:41.670
you know,
especially the songs,
Jujitsu,
I think it's a great time.

426
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.870
You have to be confident in everything you do.
If you got to do standup,

427
00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.370
you have to be confident.

428
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:51.140
<v 5>You can't fake fake it with competence.
You know,
technical competence.</v>

429
00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.900
You gotta you gotta be in the fucking groove when you're a comic.

430
00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:58.640
What are you playing buddy?
His new song that it,
this is the old version.

431
00:23:58.641 --> 00:24:01.010
This is the demo.
This was on your,
uh,

432
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:04.910
smoke serpent page on reverbnation.
Thank you.

433
00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:10.190
They don't have the new version of [inaudible].
No,
that's,
he was,

434
00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.460
he's fucking with you all.
I was,
no,
I wasn't,

435
00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:16.400
I thought you said it was the new version.
Come on,
come on.
Oh,

436
00:24:16.401 --> 00:24:20.570
drop 2011 and what you're talking about that a time river.
Yeah,
that's onto,

437
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.570
but that's not the song that Danny Lonna priced.
Right.

438
00:24:23.571 --> 00:24:26.120
We actually are working on a Daniel owner version of that song too,

439
00:24:26.121 --> 00:24:28.270
which is totally different.
It's like,
Oh,

440
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:32.450
you're not even recognize it or just it's,
it's pretty crazy now.

441
00:24:32.451 --> 00:24:37.190
In this day and age,
there's no more music business like there was before.

442
00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:42.020
Is it better for you because there's not like there's no record sales anymore.

443
00:24:42.021 --> 00:24:46.580
That shit's out the window.
It's like I tune sales and concert promotion,
right?

444
00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:51.850
Yep.
It's way better for the musician for sure.
Absolutely.
You get your shit.

445
00:24:51.851 --> 00:24:55.790
Is it better to try to get in?
Is it better this way than it was before?
It was.

446
00:24:55.791 --> 00:24:57.050
He goes the way it was before.

447
00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.660
It was very difficult to break into the music business.
Right,

448
00:24:59.661 --> 00:25:02.720
and you'd get leads.
These crazy contracts.
Look,

449
00:25:02.721 --> 00:25:05.990
I remember Courtney love wrote some article about it,
about how,

450
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:11.030
how crazy though the financial breakdown is of like who owns what and where the

451
00:25:11.031 --> 00:25:14.660
money goes and how long it is before artists actually start getting paid.

452
00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:18.170
It's pretty,
it's pretty brutal,
but it's not like that anymore.

453
00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:23.480
It the odds are,
I mean it's totally in favor now of the artists,

454
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:26.300
but still,
you know,
I mean it helps being signed to a major label.

455
00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:30.170
They still have all the avenues to get your stuff on MTV if you know.

456
00:25:30.171 --> 00:25:32.690
But you know,
now you can,
you know,

457
00:25:32.691 --> 00:25:36.590
put your stuff on iTunes in the whole world has access to it instantly from

458
00:25:36.591 --> 00:25:39.830
their phone.
That is massive for the artist.
Yeah.

459
00:25:39.831 --> 00:25:42.800
Now it's just about publicizing your shit.
Now it's about letting,

460
00:25:42.801 --> 00:25:46.670
cause I don't know about it exactly what's going on.
Let us know when you're a,

461
00:25:46.671 --> 00:25:48.000
when you're going to release the whole thing.

462
00:25:48.001 --> 00:25:50.390
And we're gonna release a CD on iTunes.
Yes.

463
00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:53.960
What we're releasing the single the singles as we're done with them.

464
00:25:53.961 --> 00:25:56.150
So right now,
so far we have Jujitsu.
We have one song,

465
00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:59.810
you can get it for free right now.
Once the video is out,
um,
you know,

466
00:25:59.811 --> 00:26:03.440
then I'm going to put on iTunes and it's gonna be like a dollar 29 or whatever

467
00:26:03.441 --> 00:26:03.890
the hell it is.

468
00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:07.370
But right now I'm just letting people have it for free for a couple of weeks on

469
00:26:07.371 --> 00:26:09.680
reverbnation powerful,

470
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:14.950
powerful Internet.
Yeah.
To look just like that.
It's amazing.

471
00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.350
Listen to this podcast and nobody ever gave me a radio show.

472
00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:21.860
I had talked about doing a radio show forever cause I would go and sit in on

473
00:26:21.861 --> 00:26:23.480
people's radio shows,
you know,

474
00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:27.470
and it would be fun like you know Dale Dudley and Austin or open Anthony or

475
00:26:27.471 --> 00:26:29.240
something like that.
You know,
it's always a good time.

476
00:26:29.241 --> 00:26:32.740
It's fun to just sit and even doing censored radio where you're,

477
00:26:32.741 --> 00:26:37.130
you're going there and you're,
you know,
you're talking with,
you know,

478
00:26:37.131 --> 00:26:40.130
you're making sure you don't swear and you know certain subjects can't even

479
00:26:40.131 --> 00:26:43.070
breach,
you know,
like they told us last time that we couldn't say retard.

480
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:44.040
Remember that was the last

481
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.720
<v 0>one that was,
yeah.</v>

482
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:50.250
That's a new word that's been recently eliminated from the vocabulary of things

483
00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:53.670
you can say and not regular radio is brutal man.
Have you seen that?

484
00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:58.650
That censored version of
tropic thunder?

485
00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:02.970
Remember that whole retard part?
Oh yeah.
No.
What is it?
You can't go full special.

486
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:07.480
You went full special.
Oh no it does.
He goes no and full specialness.

487
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:11.790
What's go full special?
Was it just like on TV it's really bad.

488
00:27:11.791 --> 00:27:16.350
Like the over double that is actually even more offensive because special

489
00:27:16.351 --> 00:27:19.440
implies that the person has like down syndrome or something like that.

490
00:27:19.441 --> 00:27:24.120
Retard is just,
you're,
you're a fucking idiot.
You know someone's a retard.

491
00:27:24.121 --> 00:27:27.540
They're a fucking idiot,
but it actually ends in tropic thunder.
It wasn't even,

492
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.500
it wasn't actually was that it was actually about down.
It was.

493
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:34.980
It actually was retired.
He went full retard.
She says Christ.

494
00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.590
That was hilarious.
You finally saw it.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

495
00:27:38.591 --> 00:27:41.640
You didn't see three in the class.
That's great.

496
00:27:41.641 --> 00:27:46.480
Everybody in tropic thunder's a douchebag.
Nobody is cooling it.
Right.

497
00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.650
Ben Stiller made that Ben Stiller made that whole thing himself.
Right.

498
00:27:49.651 --> 00:27:52.470
He's a bad mother fucker.
They need direct that,
something like that.

499
00:27:52.471 --> 00:27:54.580
He's a bad motherfucker.
That was,
that was come earlier.

500
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.680
Every character was great movie.
It was a great movie.
The whole thing.

501
00:27:58.681 --> 00:28:02.760
It was just enough over the top.
Just enough silly,
you know?

502
00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:06.810
You know when I knew it was fucking going to be the greatest movie ever is when

503
00:28:06.811 --> 00:28:10.530
that Dude's head blew up,
the director,
what is that fucking blew up?
I'm like,

504
00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:15.130
Oh shit.
That go on that way and that scared the fuck out no limit.
It's like,

505
00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:16.860
you know,
pineapple express where it's a comedy,

506
00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:19.980
but people are fucking get in their heads blown off.
You know what I mean?
That's,

507
00:28:19.981 --> 00:28:22.320
that's,
that's a whole definitely common scene.

508
00:28:22.321 --> 00:28:24.870
I still haven't seen pineapple express.
Not as good as tropic thunder.

509
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:29.220
Tropic thunder was so hard to be like,

510
00:28:29.221 --> 00:28:33.090
the only thing that could be tropic thunder and get closed like Talladega nights

511
00:28:33.091 --> 00:28:34.890
or hangover or something like that.
And you know,

512
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:39.900
Robert Downey playing that dude black makeup on.
I mean,
come on,

513
00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:43.110
it was so crazy.
He's got black makeup on,

514
00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:45.800
he's in the fucking jungle and he's still got black band.
Got Bar.

515
00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:50.550
What was the deal with that guy?
Did he have his pig?
Is,
is um,
is

516
00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:55.770
to his role?
So he just became a black guy,
right?
But did he become,

517
00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:00.060
did he change his pigment?
Which wore makeup everywhere?
Just everywhere I went.

518
00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:00.961
You know,

519
00:29:00.961 --> 00:29:05.220
there are dudes like that that they'll like get in a role and then the entire

520
00:29:05.221 --> 00:29:06.540
time they're working on the set,

521
00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.690
like when they're talking to the grips or whatever,
they talk in character,

522
00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:12.300
you know,
hey,
they weren't even shooting.
And he was like,

523
00:29:12.301 --> 00:29:15.810
he kept on and on the right will you get out of this goddamn character?

524
00:29:15.811 --> 00:29:17.220
Why don't you come though,
man?
I don't,

525
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:21.540
I don't drop character until I do commentary for the DVD.
Wow.

526
00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:27.870
What the fuck?
It was funny when he said it.
Of course.
Yeah.
Generally,

527
00:29:27.871 --> 00:29:29.670
generally Jack Black movies,

528
00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:33.480
I'm not really that into generally in school of rock was good.
Did you see that?

529
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.740
Yeah,
that was,
that was all right.
Like Nacho Libra,
I'm not,

530
00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.160
I wasn't a fan read back like we had that one.
Me,

531
00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:42.130
we walked out of that in 20 minutes.
I did not like that movie.

532
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:46.360
<v 2>That was about it as a blanket.
No,
just because you guys only took it 10 minutes.</v>

533
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:50.920
You only give it 10 minutes for like that.
Whatever it was.
Let's call it 15.

534
00:29:50.921 --> 00:29:54.040
It was brutal,
but he was first 50 was killing the fuck.

535
00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:59.050
I said no me had Ari both days.
Yeah.
You went hard bolts that we were barbecued.

536
00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.340
Yeah,
we were frazzled.

537
00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:04.750
Still wasn't good cause cause my girlfriend really likes you because you got to

538
00:30:04.751 --> 00:30:07.780
watch it again and sometimes you even want something again like anchor man.

539
00:30:07.781 --> 00:30:10.620
The second time was better.
I'm like way better first time.

540
00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:11.680
Like I didn't really didn't get it,

541
00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:16.890
<v 5>but um,
he was,
Jack Black was incredible and tropic thunder,</v>

542
00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:21.650
he was incredible man.
I thought,
I thought,
damn,
he's just killing Larry's.
Yeah.

543
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:25.200
Yeah.
He was great.
But Robert Downey jr took it from me and you know,

544
00:30:25.201 --> 00:30:28.440
Ben Stiller was really funny and it's was a good fucking movie man.

545
00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:32.220
And we're all really snapped that many good movies,
man.
It's a lot.

546
00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:35.220
When you look at like great movies too.
Shit movies,

547
00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:40.260
it's probably like 10 shit movies to one great one,
right?
Yeah,
dude,

548
00:30:40.261 --> 00:30:43.500
there's so many big actors in that movie.

549
00:30:43.501 --> 00:30:47.370
They probably got paid 50 grand deed or sound.
There's just too many actors.

550
00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:51.940
Danny Mcbride was in it.
Nick naulty.
Uh,
Tom fucking cruise.
Yeah.

551
00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:56.970
Holy Shit.
Awesome.
That must've been a party.
He played that crazy executive guy.

552
00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:00.120
Oh,
fun filming that movie.
Oh fuck.
Yeah.

553
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:04.740
That must've been a wild time.
Yeah.
That's a classic.
That's an all time classic.

554
00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.920
Not Time.
Many of them,
man.
Not that many.
All time classes.

555
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:10.650
<v 2>I liked the commercials at the beginning,
like whatever that is.</v>

556
00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.800
[inaudible] the booty.
A drink or Rick Swartz.

557
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:16.380
<v 5>Come on,
there's going to do the podcast again.
I say I want to do it.</v>

558
00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:21.180
He did a movie and it bombed so bad.
He went to Hawaii for two months.

559
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:25.470
He just said,
I can't take it.
He goes,
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

560
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:27.270
He went to Hawaii for two months.

561
00:31:27.271 --> 00:31:29.970
He did a movie that got a zero on rotten tomatoes.

562
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:34.110
Did it get released nationally or what was the movie?
Uh,

563
00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.470
<v 2>Bucky,
the porn star where he played,
uh Oh</v>

564
00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:41.250
<v 5>that Joey was in that one.
Yeah.
Josie.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

565
00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:43.180
Send it bombed hard.

566
00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.113
<v 2>Yeah,
I heard of Israel.</v>

567
00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:49.590
That's weird to me cause I think even funny even it's so bad that at least that

568
00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:52.380
there had to be one person that said,
yeah,
you know,
it's a dumb way.

569
00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:54.740
It's an x war two movie.
It's what is what it is.
But

570
00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:58.680
<v 5>a lot of these movies,
man,
there's a lot of people fucking with it,</v>

571
00:31:58.681 --> 00:32:02.310
especially on a,
if you're a guy like Nick Swardson,

572
00:32:02.311 --> 00:32:06.270
this is your first shot at making a big movie with your name on it.

573
00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.000
That might've been a lot of cooks in the kitchen.
You know,

574
00:32:09.001 --> 00:32:14.001
I told this story before I was on a movie once a Frank McCluskey Cei and I had

575
00:32:14.071 --> 00:32:16.110
the scene that eventually got cut out of the whole movie.

576
00:32:16.111 --> 00:32:21.111
But I watched this funny dude get all these different line readings from all

577
00:32:21.451 --> 00:32:22.231
these executives.

578
00:32:22.231 --> 00:32:24.840
They're all telling them how to do it and they completely ruined the movie.

579
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.840
I watched it happen.
I watched all these guys in suits,

580
00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:31.440
literally tell this guy how to do his scene and that like,

581
00:32:31.441 --> 00:32:33.510
this is what I want you to,
I want you to come in.
Like they were,

582
00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:34.291
they were telling,

583
00:32:34.291 --> 00:32:36.750
they won't even do the director and the director couldn't do shit about it.

584
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:40.280
He was powerless and the whole thing became a mess,
but easily

585
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.040
<v 0>could have happened to a movie and everyone just shits on it.</v>

586
00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:48.040
[inaudible] you know,
uh,
while we're on that subject really quick,
um,
I,

587
00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:50.450
I did a short movie,
Super Low budget with,

588
00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:53.620
with a Joey DHEAS and with [inaudible],

589
00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:57.800
we're releasing it on my youtube channel tonight at midnight.

590
00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:02.960
It's called return of the depth knuckle.
Um,
it's going to be interesting to see.

591
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:08.120
Do doesn't even look real.
I saw the,
I saw the,
it doesn't look real.

592
00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:11.180
Looks like your pumpkin people.
That's what I with dot.

593
00:33:11.181 --> 00:33:14.480
Kates potato about that too.
It's actually,
we actually did,

594
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:19.430
whose idea was the movie?
Well,
it was,
it was like this.

595
00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:20.480
It was supposed to be,

596
00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:24.700
<v 6>well this the,</v>

597
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:35.490
there's other music.
Oh,
let's add another song in the background.
Brian.

598
00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:40.400
Brian,
what do you doing,

599
00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:46.650
<v 0>Brian?
Positive Shit.
So he killed that song.
What the fuck can you play?</v>

600
00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:51.230
What are you playing?
I don't even know where it's coming from.

601
00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:54.860
That was you serious.
You don't know where it's coming from.
Look at your browser.

602
00:33:54.861 --> 00:33:58.610
Open your browser.
It's something's playing you freak.
What are you doing?

603
00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.710
You ready to kill yourself?
Do you have something to tell me?

604
00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.230
If that's the music you listening to,
will he leave?

605
00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.960
Can imagine you listen to like burl Ives and shit.

606
00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:09.590
<v 6>Bam.
[inaudible] volume.</v>

607
00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:16.260
This is Flavio de Souza

608
00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:24.300
got more a black belt cop killer.

609
00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.890
I don't want you guys take any unnecessary risks out there.

610
00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:29.390
He's already killed one.

611
00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:39.530
[inaudible] the people just listen to audio.

612
00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:04.790
Really ridiculous shit.

613
00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:18.740
<v 0>It looks,
most people listening,
this was just a lot of music is what it is.</v>

614
00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:27.390
If you go online,
you can see this clip on youtube,
but it's fair.

615
00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:31.760
That was very honestly [inaudible] comments.

616
00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:37.290
What would you think was awesome about it?
Uh,
cause I know Eddie,
you know,

617
00:35:37.291 --> 00:35:38.040
so,
and I know

618
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:42.360
<v 3>Joey and I think your fans and I think people that know you are gonna love it.</v>

619
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:45.590
I at least that's what I would think because I think it looks fucking,

620
00:35:45.591 --> 00:35:47.640
I want to say,
I'm sure you just never know.

621
00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:51.510
I screened it in Saint Louis last Saturday.
I'd probably like 30,
like 10.

622
00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:54.580
You have to be a,
you have to know the,
the,

623
00:35:54.581 --> 00:35:59.400
the character [inaudible] he's actually a 10 out the lounge up playing Flavio

624
00:35:59.401 --> 00:36:03.150
does is so it's like a,
it's fake within fake,
you know what I mean?

625
00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:07.890
So we got like,
like we ended up in the same goddamn movie.
Fuck I got,

626
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:11.460
you know what I mean?
And in the movie I play a cop like a really cool,

627
00:36:11.461 --> 00:36:15.240
like Vince Vaughn type cop going after his nap.
Alondra,
this,

628
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:17.640
this Brazilian steroid trafficker,

629
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:21.690
he's the son of an assay plantation owner,

630
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:28.070
dude in Joey killed it in the jellies in it to man.
He plays into the movement.

631
00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:32.910
Funny.
Is it funny dude?
If you understand the characters,
everyone was dying.

632
00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:36.930
Everyone thinks it's insane.
Pools.
Everyone.
Uh,
that was that at the,

633
00:36:36.931 --> 00:36:40.680
at the screening in Saint Louis,
unless they lied to me,
unless they lied to me,

634
00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:44.700
people were laughing their asses off and said it was,
well,

635
00:36:44.701 --> 00:36:48.930
there's always an audience.
I don't know.
I don't,
regular people might not get it.

636
00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.340
They're probably like people that don't know,

637
00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:52.320
like if you're not a hardcore MMA fan,

638
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:55.950
you probably ain't going to understand like the whole Brazilian hand apple think

639
00:36:55.951 --> 00:36:58.440
is,
it's really,
it is like an inside joke.

640
00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:01.650
I would love to see it to see if I understand it cause I don't know anything

641
00:37:01.651 --> 00:37:02.190
that's going,

642
00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:03.280
<v 5>you wouldn't understand it.
You know,</v>

643
00:37:03.281 --> 00:37:07.810
I had a conversation with what I had to do some stuff today for the UFC and the

644
00:37:07.811 --> 00:37:11.740
dude who I'm talking to is a friend of mine,
my friend John.
And uh,

645
00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:15.400
he thought it was real.
He totally thought it was real.
I go,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I go,

646
00:37:15.401 --> 00:37:17.880
this is my pet out though.
Yeah.
I go to a friend of mine,
I go,

647
00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:20.590
he's a brown belt under Eddie.
He's a really good guy.

648
00:37:20.591 --> 00:37:23.740
He's an actor and he's like,
no fucking way.
I go,
yeah.
He goes,

649
00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:26.840
you mean their whole thing that James Brown that was fake?
I go,
yeah,
it was fake.

650
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:30.670
We were just fucking around.
It's like,
did you have a scrip?
No,
we just started.

651
00:37:30.671 --> 00:37:33.430
We're just fucking around.
No,
man.
Everybody thinks that's real.

652
00:37:33.431 --> 00:37:37.420
That I was a real guy that was like mad at me.
I will say this,
I will say this,

653
00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:42.050
<v 3>I haven't took acting lessons in like 15 years.</v>

654
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:45.500
My acting's not going to be fucking Robert Dinair.
I was,
you know,
it's,
it's,

655
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:49.850
it's okay at best,
right.
But raison as [inaudible],

656
00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:53.690
every scene,
every word that came out of his mouth,

657
00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:58.100
the way we put this together is,
um,
Christo Garcia.

658
00:37:58.101 --> 00:37:59.240
He came to me,
he's a guy,

659
00:37:59.241 --> 00:38:03.110
he produces television shows on like cable and stuff and his,

660
00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:06.620
he has asked where he's a karate guy and his aspirations where you need to be

661
00:38:06.621 --> 00:38:10.550
this filmmaker making like big karate movies.
He came to my gym and said,
dude,

662
00:38:10.551 --> 00:38:13.550
I want to put you in a movie.
I got a script and you're going to be a trainer.

663
00:38:13.551 --> 00:38:18.080
Like a Mr Miyagi.
Dude.
I'm like,
I go,
man,
I'll act.
You know what I mean?

664
00:38:18.081 --> 00:38:20.660
But I'm not going to audition for shit if people offer me,

665
00:38:20.661 --> 00:38:21.980
like I was a number back down to,

666
00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.310
I didn't like audition for that and I'm not gonna,
I'm not gonna,

667
00:38:25.311 --> 00:38:28.070
I'm not taking acting that seriously.
But if someone comes to me and says,

668
00:38:28.071 --> 00:38:31.490
I want to put you in a movie,
am I going to say no?
I said,
okay,
I'll do it.

669
00:38:31.491 --> 00:38:34.430
We sat down,
he showed me some scripts,
he's got like three martial arts scripts.

670
00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:35.800
I'm like,
okay.
He goes,
dude,

671
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.110
I'm going to put you in this one and I think you'd be great in this.
I go,

672
00:38:38.111 --> 00:38:41.020
do you haven't even seen me act like,
are you sure I get it?

673
00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:45.040
I sent him quad too funny.
He goes,
dude,
you could ask.
So anyways,
anyways,

674
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:47.740
I love the people make movies like that.
I didn't even,
I'd even,

675
00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.810
so this is what happened.
So I told him,
I go,

676
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:53.890
I can totally just be in your movies and just read your lines and stuff like

677
00:38:53.891 --> 00:38:58.750
that.
We could do that or you could let me,
you know,
bring in like my people,

678
00:38:58.751 --> 00:39:01.870
cause I got some talented people around me and he goes,
he was like totally cool.

679
00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:04.710
He goes,
yeah,
yeah,
Woo Hoo.
He didn't know.
He didn't know Hassan.

680
00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:08.650
And he didn't know Joey at all.
I sat them down and go watch these motherfuckers.

681
00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:12.190
These guys are already hits.
People already love them.

682
00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:16.660
They're already grand slam jewels.
Let's,
let's put them in.

683
00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:20.230
Let's put them all in this shit and make this a comedy.
And he goes,
what?
I go,

684
00:39:20.231 --> 00:39:20.710
I already got,

685
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:24.340
I already got the store cause I had the Joey karate story in my head,

686
00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:28.210
I've been trying to put it together like the real,
like Joey karate as like,

687
00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:32.350
you know,
I'm going to black belt.
Yeah,
yeah.
But yeah,
but he'd be like a mob guy.

688
00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.120
My idea was he's a mob dude,

689
00:39:34.121 --> 00:39:37.870
like a hit man who wants to get out of the mob and do MMA cause he's like this

690
00:39:37.871 --> 00:39:40.830
big karate MMA fan.
Right.
And he wants to get out of them up.

691
00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:45.170
So I had this idea and I,
and uh,
we were going to roll with it.
He wanted me,

692
00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:48.400
he wanted to do it.
Oh,
for people that don't loge Brion pull up,

693
00:39:48.401 --> 00:39:49.540
pull up Joey karate.

694
00:39:49.541 --> 00:39:54.100
Gimme a Joey karate because he does one where he gets attacked and it is fucking

695
00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:58.930
awesome.
Man.
Fights the dudes off,
come on his care whatever ways.

696
00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:03.280
That's an amazing and Joey and basically he's not even acting like he grew up

697
00:40:03.281 --> 00:40:04.031
doing karate.

698
00:40:04.031 --> 00:40:08.650
And the crazy thing about Joey growing up doing karate in New York is that

699
00:40:08.651 --> 00:40:13.340
Rustin's dad was his teacher.
Isn't that nuts?
You knew that,
right?
Yeah.
Okay.

700
00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:15.550
Is that it's fucking crazy.

701
00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:20.000
What are the fucking possible odds of all the teachers?
Yes.

702
00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:24.550
Give me some volume people.
People watching this at home can see.
That's right.

703
00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:29.050
Yeah.
We were watching Joe.
What's the name of this one?
Brian is the first joke.

704
00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:31.060
Writing totally karate number one.

705
00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:37.660
If he really knows karate,
real shit.
I'm serious.

706
00:40:37.661 --> 00:40:40.030
He's the funniest guy that's ever walked the face of the earth.

707
00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:41.470
No one's even close.

708
00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:45.820
No one close to Joey is mad flavor.

709
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:52.400
<v 7>Oh Dude.
This is a fucked always showing karate,</v>

710
00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:55.180
so you understand me here for the UFC minute,

711
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:57.940
people seem in the medical marijuana reports.

712
00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.690
A lot of people seem in the sports reports,
but nobody really knows.

713
00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:05.020
I'm a trained fucking assassin,
Cuban black belts.

714
00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.080
I lost my rank on the fucking boat ride over,

715
00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:11.720
came knocked McDonald's Greenberg and I'm fighting to get it back and then

716
00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:15.610
stabbed me.
I take my shit back from the fucking jungle in China,

717
00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:20.410
Hong Kong,
Olivia.
That's why training is fucking savages.

718
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:25.770
These little fucking guys flying through the air.
Just joke around.

719
00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:29.720
He's going to give you the lock for UFC and it's all about fucking Brazil this

720
00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.330
weekend.
You understand me,
my man,

721
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:35.000
and this is Silva gonna fuck people up this weekend in his name.

722
00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:39.290
He went through kiss Leben.
He went through forest with a far as Griffin,

723
00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:41.360
lumped them out.
Let me show you.

724
00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:44.230
I'll put this motherfucker first off is and together with a clip.

725
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:47.210
That's the movie type Shit.
You understand that?
I started movies die.

726
00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:49.750
I'm not really entirely over the Thai restaurant.

727
00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:54.560
I'm fucking guy with the quench go home.
He used to the fucking head check.

728
00:41:54.561 --> 00:41:58.160
I'm going to psychic Lisa Gentleman to some fucking Samurai.

729
00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:02.350
Well some on bar with some fucking choke them out.

730
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:07.280
It's that simple.
And this is Sylvia,
the Samueli,
those traditional,

731
00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:14.360
well that's it baby girl.
Forget UFC.
Catch me next week.
What?

732
00:42:14.361 --> 00:42:15.081
All my other things.

733
00:42:15.081 --> 00:42:18.470
I'm his family next week we're going to cover stretching and flying through the

734
00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:19.850
fuck.
They're

735
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.430
fucking there.
Come on.

736
00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:29.480
<v 3>That was great.
And you could tell like that was his first one.
That was all gold.</v>

737
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:30.980
But like now when he does them,

738
00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:35.180
he's just so like conflict cause he was just getting into the UFC back then.

739
00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:37.970
He wasn't into MMA for a while.
He was hanging out with us.

740
00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:39.860
He hated it when we talked about the UFC.

741
00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:41.930
But then when the ultimate fighter came out,

742
00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:45.370
he was one of those guys that got hooked through the ultimate fighter and all of

743
00:42:45.371 --> 00:42:48.230
a sudden he's a fanatic.
And that was the first one.
He,
he,

744
00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:51.290
he'll admit he didn't have as much confidence picking back then cause he's new

745
00:42:51.291 --> 00:42:54.560
to the sport.
But now when you watch them do the the 10th planet Kush is,

746
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:59.000
he's on fucking fire.
He knows MMA,

747
00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:02.720
the keynote,
he knows,
he knows shit about MMA.

748
00:43:02.721 --> 00:43:07.721
That I would never know like he knows when the next five you fcs are at and what

749
00:43:08.661 --> 00:43:13.250
stadium,
what city?
He knows all that shit.
It's crazy.

750
00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:16.310
I don't know when the fucking next UFC as there's like three a month.
Yeah.

751
00:43:16.311 --> 00:43:20.150
Joey's a fan though.
Here.
They're going to be in Baltimore next week.
I'm like,

752
00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.073
Oh shit.
Really?

753
00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:24.340
<v 5>He thinks that everything's a scam.
You know,</v>

754
00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:26.170
he thinks whenever there's an underdog,

755
00:43:26.171 --> 00:43:30.040
if an underdog wins is like you'd never met a booklet with a part time job

756
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:32.910
<v 3>and that's what he said during Cain Velasquez and junior dos Santos.</v>

757
00:43:32.911 --> 00:43:37.020
He said it and I got him on film at the show at the UFC goes and I just wanted

758
00:43:37.021 --> 00:43:40.080
to get his prediction because we didn't do a 10th planet cush for that UFC and

759
00:43:40.081 --> 00:43:43.950
he goes and he said just like that,
you never seen a bookie with a part time job.

760
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.910
Something's up right here.
Look for King of Alaska is the go down quick.

761
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:51.120
Could you call this Joey karate called it.

762
00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:56.100
<v 5>Could you imagine if it was a scam if we found that that fighters,
that fighters,</v>

763
00:43:56.101 --> 00:43:59.550
we're letting dudes knocked him out and shit like that cause they bet a fuck

764
00:43:59.551 --> 00:44:03.380
load of money on them.
Is that possible?
Yeah.
I always think things like that.

765
00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.300
And you don't think that part for doing,
sorry,

766
00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:07.590
I would never suggest that anybody's ever done that.

767
00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:09.810
But don't you think that if someone tried to do that,

768
00:44:09.811 --> 00:44:11.490
I don't believe that Cain Velasquez did that.

769
00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:15.120
I believe came Velasquez got hit with a fucking hard shot man.

770
00:44:15.121 --> 00:44:16.700
I don't think anybody who gets hit by that,

771
00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:20.400
that's just one of those things about the first few minutes of an MMA fight when

772
00:44:20.401 --> 00:44:22.170
a guy has like full steam,

773
00:44:22.171 --> 00:44:26.130
a hundred percent junior was just starting to settle in.
He just walloped him,

774
00:44:26.131 --> 00:44:28.860
man.
He,
if he hits anybody with that shot,
you're,
you're fucked.

775
00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:31.950
<v 3>He clubbed him.
I was a shocker.
It was a shocker.</v>

776
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.113
<v 5>It was brilliant.</v>

777
00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:37.700
I thought it would take a lot more to take king of Alaska's not,

778
00:44:37.701 --> 00:44:40.650
I mean he got hit in that sweet spot right on the top of the side of the head.

779
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:44.280
Everybody goes down,
junior can fucking punch man.
He punches hard.

780
00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.520
And you know when you see the impact,
you know where it actually landed.

781
00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:52.030
It actually landed bone to bone.
Yep.
It didn't land with the uh,
the,

782
00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:53.940
the actual padding and the glove.
Yeah.

783
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:58.200
He gave him a super negi Exupery actually.
Yeah.

784
00:44:58.201 --> 00:45:02.330
Well yeah,
it's amazing that he didn't break his hand,
you know,
because I,

785
00:45:02.331 --> 00:45:04.530
I guess that can function as a knuckle,
but God,

786
00:45:04.531 --> 00:45:09.420
it can't be as hard as the top Nakil and I mean he blasted them.
Man.

787
00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:14.640
That was a crazy punch.
It's crazy.
So here's a rate overall,
what do you think,

788
00:45:14.641 --> 00:45:18.330
what should the bottom line as far as how that,
uh,

789
00:45:18.331 --> 00:45:22.890
the opening show with Fox went down,
you think?
You think?
Uh,
it was,

790
00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:24.600
cause it was good too.
It was like,
look,

791
00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:27.000
now you could build this guys like Mike Tyson.
Yeah.

792
00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:30.690
Goes out there and Mike Tyson's dudes,
it wasn't bad for Mike Tyson was it?

793
00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:34.590
It's never bad when a guy can stop a guy that quick.
I don't think it's ever bad.

794
00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:35.470
I'm in a,
it's,

795
00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:39.930
it wasn't the best demonstration of mixed martial arts in the sense that it

796
00:45:39.931 --> 00:45:41.310
didn't go back and forth.

797
00:45:41.311 --> 00:45:45.660
You didn't see like a long fight where the momentum changed hands in Kendo and

798
00:45:45.661 --> 00:45:50.610
show gun shit.
But I think other than that,
it was a great result.

799
00:45:50.611 --> 00:45:55.500
I mean it was,
it was stunning,
you know,
was,
it was,
it was decisive.

800
00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:58.580
You know,
junior dropped him,
jumped all over him,
bad,
battered,
dumb.

801
00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:02.400
There was no doubt about it was a perfect stoppage.
See,
I think that's good.

802
00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:04.060
A perfect stop.
Which is good.
I know.

803
00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:08.790
I think watching a guy take a guy out legit in 64 seconds and especially when

804
00:46:08.791 --> 00:46:12.750
you're taking the guy out like Cain Velasquez,
holy shit man.
That's God damn.

805
00:46:12.751 --> 00:46:15.510
That's impressive.
Well,
when you look at what we learned from the fight,

806
00:46:15.511 --> 00:46:17.790
like you said,
we learned that Holy Shit,

807
00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:21.450
junior dos Santos is like the Mike Tyson of and the main,

808
00:46:21.451 --> 00:46:25.170
now he's knocking dudes a big block,
heads out in one punch.
Yet Sarah,

809
00:46:25.171 --> 00:46:28.950
he's got really good timing.
I mean,
he doesn't catch everybody in every fight,

810
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:29.670
you know,
like,

811
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:33.060
and then some dudes he couldn't put away like he couldn't play it put away Roy

812
00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:37.230
Nelson.
Roy Nelson is a monster man.
Boy Nelson,
God damn,
that guy,

813
00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:41.990
he lost weight finally.
Holy Shit.
He's going to lose more to Holy Shit.

814
00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:45.240
He knows man looked.
He's fucking good dude.

815
00:46:45.241 --> 00:46:48.750
Roy Roy Nelson actually said to me in the cage after the fight,
like,

816
00:46:48.751 --> 00:46:51.690
you're always calling me fat.
I'm like,
you know,
I got stuck there.
I'm like,

817
00:46:51.691 --> 00:46:54.180
I don't want to say I didn't want to insult him,
but I said,

818
00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:57.150
but it's because you're fat.
And,
and he calls himself out.

819
00:46:57.151 --> 00:46:59.040
He comes out to that Michael Jackson fats.

820
00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:02.340
I don't say it because I don't like them.
I love that guy.

821
00:47:02.341 --> 00:47:03.690
I think he's talented as fuck.

822
00:47:03.691 --> 00:47:08.580
I think it's amazing that he's able to do what he can do and be in the kind of

823
00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:11.850
physical condition that he's in.
I mean,
carrying around that extra weight.

824
00:47:11.851 --> 00:47:14.550
I know that he's strong and he's got good cardio.

825
00:47:14.551 --> 00:47:17.370
He's got good endurance for a big guy that can't be helping.

826
00:47:17.371 --> 00:47:21.000
I'm just no way that helps them.
I go down to one 70 can you imagine?

827
00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:24.510
You would ever know.
I think he can ever know.
I think he'd go to oh five though.

828
00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:29.160
I think he go raid five and 300 yeah,
but I think he's a bigger guy.

829
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.520
Big countries.
A thick fucking guy.
You in his head,
his bands.

830
00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:36.160
One of the reasons why I take a shot so well,
he's so sturdy.
You know I don't,

831
00:47:36.161 --> 00:47:39.670
I don't see that guy going below two oh five I think even two oh five is going

832
00:47:39.671 --> 00:47:42.610
to be a struggle for them.
Even if you got down to a low body fat.

833
00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:44.380
He's a thick fucking dude.

834
00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:47.950
You know God damn that motherfucker can punch for a Jujitsu guy.

835
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:50.350
Big countries got a serious right hand.

836
00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:53.450
The one he put Brendan Schaub out with Bob Plan.

837
00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:57.340
There's a lot of hardcore Roy Nelson fans that have always stuck up for his

838
00:47:57.341 --> 00:47:59.540
fatness and now they're all pissed off.
You know?

839
00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:05.050
I liked it when he was fat.
There's gotta be,
yeah,

840
00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:08.230
a lot of fat guys do,
man.
I have fat friends that love it.

841
00:48:08.231 --> 00:48:12.250
When Roy blast somebody out now they're like shit or hero.
He sold out.

842
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:17.680
He wants to beat the best guys.
He could be like a,
you know,
no offense,

843
00:48:17.681 --> 00:48:21.670
but he could be like a butter bean of MMA,
you know?
Or he could really go for it.

844
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:26.290
You know,
Roy Nelson Dude has a chance against a lot of fucking people,

845
00:48:26.291 --> 00:48:29.290
man and Roy Nelson,
if he loses weight,
has a chance of,
again,

846
00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:32.020
the more way he loses,
the better condition he gets,

847
00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:34.750
the more people he's going to be able to beat.
That guy is a beast,
man.

848
00:48:34.751 --> 00:48:37.480
You see what he did?
He Cro cop once he got his back.
Yup.

849
00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.780
He's a fucking beast and he took some shots in that fight.
Cro.

850
00:48:40.781 --> 00:48:42.640
Cop hit him with some bombs.
Man,

851
00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:46.840
there's an animated Gif of Cro cop having him up against the fence and he's

852
00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:51.340
covering up and rolling with punches and Cro.
Cop is just blasted him.

853
00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:56.340
Do just put full blast cause he knows that Roy is not falling back and Roy just

854
00:48:56.921 --> 00:48:59.990
ate at all.
He didn't say it at all.
I mean he can fucking take it man.

855
00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:01.960
I've known him tough as shit.

856
00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:06.310
I've known him for a long ass time and I've always known him as a Jujitsu guy.

857
00:49:06.311 --> 00:49:10.090
So him becoming this badass striker,
crazy,
shocking.

858
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:13.720
I've known him for a long time.
He's always been really good with Jujitsu.

859
00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:17.590
I think he's just a badass period,
you know.
I mean he might have this,

860
00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:23.190
you know,
overweight body,
but that dude is underneath all that shit.
He's uh,

861
00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:24.210
he's like,
you know,

862
00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:28.240
he's like a super athlete that has like a disadvantage,

863
00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:31.690
like a super athlete that wears a weight vest when he goes into a fight.

864
00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:35.980
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
I mean,
you know,
bad ass.
He would be at two oh five.

865
00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:39.490
Holy Shit.
Yup.
And now what's up with that?

866
00:49:39.491 --> 00:49:41.890
What was your thoughts on the Henderson Shogun fight?

867
00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:45.790
There was the greatest fight in the history of,
of fight.
The greatest.
Yeah,

868
00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:48.880
I think it was the greatest fight of all time.
Yeah,
I do.
Yeah.

869
00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:53.170
And it wasn't because both guys were in the best shape they could possibly be
in.

870
00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:54.880
And it wasn't because,
you know,

871
00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:58.330
it wasn't because they were at the top of their game.

872
00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:02.380
It was because it was so fucking real.

873
00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:07.650
It went back and forth in Shogun came so close to getting stopped and Dan

874
00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:12.760
Henderson,
God damn,
can he punch hard?
He broke shoguns whole face,
dude.
Sjogren's,

875
00:50:12.761 --> 00:50:16.960
whole faces,
fuck he might have to get is,
you know,
face put back together again.

876
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:17.231
You know,

877
00:50:17.231 --> 00:50:21.640
it's got like orbital fractures and cheek fractures and shit and he got a drew

878
00:50:21.641 --> 00:50:26.170
that and then wind up taking Anderson down.
I mean dude,
it was crazy.

879
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:31.230
I mean it the best display of defense versus offense or two guys that you know

880
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:36.230
in the putting on like a,
you know,
a GSP,
Anderson Silva type performance.

881
00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:39.590
But what it was was fucking,
as far as like matchups,

882
00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:43.250
you couldn't get a tighter matchup.
It,
they were so close,

883
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:47.840
it ended just like rocky one.
Yeah.
You know,
a rocky.
Yeah.
Basically beat his ass.

884
00:50:47.841 --> 00:50:52.340
And Apollo creed got saved by the ballot.
Like Apollo thought,

885
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:56.900
you know,
rocky one,
but you know,
he wouldn't say it.
He won't admit it.
Well,

886
00:50:56.901 --> 00:50:59.990
Dana said that he thought that it was a draw.
I honestly haven't watched it.

887
00:50:59.991 --> 00:51:03.710
Again,
like if you,
if there's a thing about when you're doing commentary,

888
00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:07.130
what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to be entertaining.

889
00:51:07.131 --> 00:51:11.390
I'm going to try and explain what's happening and you're not looking at it as

890
00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:16.640
like very precisely and cleanly as if you writing down things only.
Like,

891
00:51:16.641 --> 00:51:20.030
remember when you used to judge,
he,
Eddie had a system that was pretty smart.

892
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:23.550
He wrote,
he broke down a piece of paper and then he would,
you know,

893
00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:25.700
have one guy's name on one side,
one guy's name on another side,

894
00:51:25.701 --> 00:51:28.050
and then you'd break it down by strikes,
take downs.

895
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:30.710
You had like all these different categories and you would check off each

896
00:51:30.711 --> 00:51:32.540
category.
Um,
yeah,

897
00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:37.310
I'd have like a short hand method for different flurries and different punches.

898
00:51:37.311 --> 00:51:40.250
So that man,
you forget by the end of the round,
you will forget,

899
00:51:40.251 --> 00:51:41.600
you will look back on,
I'm like okay.

900
00:51:41.601 --> 00:51:44.420
In the beginning of the round he had to take down.
That's right.
You forget.

901
00:51:44.421 --> 00:51:47.630
So especially if something really big happens,
you know,

902
00:51:47.631 --> 00:51:49.790
and then you get locked onto that for a second.
Yeah.

903
00:51:49.791 --> 00:51:52.400
You can forget what happened in the beginning of that round.
So,

904
00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:55.700
and then you put it all together and when it's close,
I just look at,
damn,
okay.

905
00:51:55.970 --> 00:52:00.920
I have,
he had two big right hands.
He had a five leg kicks.

906
00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:05.660
He had to take down an avenue some time to think about it.
I go,
ah,

907
00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:06.440
and you could,

908
00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.390
instead of thinking about it in your head and going back and forth,

909
00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:11.690
you actually see what happened.
And there's so many times where it's a 10,

910
00:52:11.691 --> 00:52:14.780
nine round where they just fucking flip a coin man.
It's like,

911
00:52:14.781 --> 00:52:17.060
you know who the hell knows?
You know,
there's some 10,
nine rounds.

912
00:52:17.061 --> 00:52:20.290
There really should be draws.
You know,
it's,
there's,

913
00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:23.750
there's gotta be a difference between,
you know,

914
00:52:23.751 --> 00:52:26.240
one of those rounds where nothing really happened,

915
00:52:26.241 --> 00:52:29.480
but dude landed three leg kicks and the other dude landed a good left hook to

916
00:52:29.481 --> 00:52:33.920
the body and that's it.
That,
that's a ten nine round.

917
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:39.490
And then the last round of Henderson Shogun is a ten nine round to like there's,

918
00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:44.360
there's,
they got to give more,
10 eights they got to give more.

919
00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:45.940
10 10 they got John and,

920
00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:50.390
and I hear the commission is telling these judges to not give 10 tens and not

921
00:52:50.391 --> 00:52:55.340
give ten eight that's ridiculous.
Yeah.
I don't think,

922
00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:59.780
I think people don't want,
they don't want to see draws.

923
00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:02.150
They want to see a clear decisive decision.

924
00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:05.750
But sometimes the correct answer is it's a draw,
you know?

925
00:53:05.751 --> 00:53:09.740
And you can't make a winner in let you know if you don't want to,
you shouldn't,

926
00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:11.830
you shouldn't.
As a judge,
you know,

927
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:15.200
I hope no commissions actually encourage them to do that because that seems like

928
00:53:15.201 --> 00:53:18.170
they're meddling with the results.
That's what I read on the underground.

929
00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:21.050
I might not be right.
We should,
we should be careful.
Before.

930
00:53:21.051 --> 00:53:23.340
So something like that.
Yeah,
that's just a rumor that,

931
00:53:23.730 --> 00:53:28.110
that the commission is telling the judges.
I mean,
I think that's a real,

932
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:31.200
I hope that's not true.
That does.
It seems like they're tampering with results.

933
00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:34.260
You know,
the saying that you have to pick a winner on one side or the other.

934
00:53:34.261 --> 00:53:37.620
There are times where you shouldn't to pick a winner.
You know,
the unfortunate,

935
00:53:37.621 --> 00:53:39.910
yeah.
But there are fights that are draws,
man.
There,

936
00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:42.570
there are fights that are absolutely draws like the,
um,

937
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:45.960
a lot of people knew a lot of people.
The Frankie Edgar Gray Maynard,

938
00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:49.980
the second fight,
you know the crazy one.
Yeah.
The last one was crazy too.

939
00:53:49.981 --> 00:53:54.960
The third one was pretty fucking crazy too.
But the second one,
um,
I mean that is,

940
00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:58.530
that's the proudest close to a draws you can get.
Right.
Don't you think?

941
00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:00.930
You don't want to have to see it again?
I don't remember.

942
00:54:00.931 --> 00:54:01.770
I'd have to see it again too.

943
00:54:01.771 --> 00:54:05.580
But I remember thinking like back and forth and what a first round for gray

944
00:54:05.581 --> 00:54:06.760
Maynard and you know,

945
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:11.790
I mean Frankie Edgar was as that any three out of five judges could have easily

946
00:54:13.141 --> 00:54:16.320
stopped that fight.
You know,
if there are trigger happy,

947
00:54:16.321 --> 00:54:20.290
if they'll stop fights early eight either.
Either one of those knocked out,

948
00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:23.060
there's a few knockdowns or he went down where a care,

949
00:54:23.130 --> 00:54:27.960
a judge who's like ultra careful would have stopped it or referee shogun could

950
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:31.020
easily,
it felt like it was,
it should have been stopped.

951
00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:33.840
But when you,
you can't really,

952
00:54:33.841 --> 00:54:38.310
you can't really say that because the bite wasn't stopped and it was let go and

953
00:54:38.311 --> 00:54:42.910
Shogun did come back.
So that was great refereeing by Josh Rosenthal.

954
00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:47.520
He to me,
Josh and her,
they're just the best,
the best.

955
00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:52.560
They don't stop shit too early.
Do Nothing.
Pisses me off more than,
you know,

956
00:54:52.561 --> 00:54:56.460
as far as a rough goes is stopping and goddamn fight to her.
I shit.
Yeah,

957
00:54:56.520 --> 00:55:00.480
let's see.
A decisive,
well,
I said down about a Kung Lee and Vandelay Silva.

958
00:55:00.481 --> 00:55:00.780
I said,

959
00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:03.840
I don't agree with that stoppage because Kang was to hold onto a single and

960
00:55:03.841 --> 00:55:07.080
Vandelay hit him with a couple of Hammerfest.
But then,
you know,
when Ken got up,

961
00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:10.410
he didn't seem to complain and his nose was smashed,
you know,

962
00:55:10.411 --> 00:55:12.870
and maybe the referee being closer to the action,

963
00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:15.240
I had a better idea of that hung was,

964
00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:18.030
he was probably close to stopping in any way.
I thought the same button,

965
00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:21.720
but I saw the Hammerfest and I was like,
that's not enough man.
You,
you know,

966
00:55:21.721 --> 00:55:26.110
it's like you guys still trying cause look,
shogun came back,
you know,

967
00:55:26.111 --> 00:55:29.010
and he was still trying.
I like the shot.
Yeah.

968
00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:34.140
Brock cat five fights that could have easily been stopped.
Yeah.
Just,
you know,

969
00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:38.990
I like to see guys come back.
It's,
it's fun.
I don't mean,
you know,

970
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:42.420
to be disrespectful to a referee and I to,
when I say they shouldn't stop it,

971
00:55:42.421 --> 00:55:45.840
it's just,
it's just an opinion thing,
you know?
You don't have to agree with it,

972
00:55:45.841 --> 00:55:48.780
but I think you've got to give guys the opportunity to win.

973
00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:51.870
You've got to give guys an opportunity if he's still fighting,
you know,

974
00:55:51.871 --> 00:55:55.850
he wasn't covering up in a ball in the fetal position,
Eaton shots,

975
00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:58.650
he was grabbing his leg and he's very likely done.

976
00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:01.920
Very likely would have just taken even more unnecessary punishment.

977
00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:05.940
But I think you got to give him a chance.
You know,
dudes can pull shit off,
man.

978
00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:09.060
Dudes,
you know,
and Connolly's a bad motherfucker.

979
00:56:09.061 --> 00:56:12.700
I'm not saying that he would have pulled it off,
but I ended up bad stoppage.

980
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:15.240
It ain't a bad stoppage.
He never appeared to me as well.
Right.

981
00:56:15.241 --> 00:56:18.060
When he stopped it,
I'm like,
aw man,
that was too quick.
But he never,

982
00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:20.940
he didn't get up on his feet for awhile.
I stayed on his knees.

983
00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:24.040
It was a good stop.
It was a good stoppage.
But it was his,
it

984
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:27.880
<v 1>was like a judgment call that he made over,
you know,
Kung trying,
you know,</v>

985
00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:31.210
I think you're done.
And he was right.
He was right.
And you know,

986
00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:34.930
maybe he would have been able to pull something off,
but most likely not,

987
00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:37.810
most likely he would've just taken more shots.
And you know,

988
00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:40.750
Vandelay Silva was like vintage Vandelay Silva in that fight.
Dude,

989
00:56:40.751 --> 00:56:44.140
when he got the,
the clinician was delivering those knees.
Damn.
I was like,

990
00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:48.280
I remembered how awesome he was with knees when they in the rampage fights and

991
00:56:48.281 --> 00:56:53.170
pride.
He's one of the best man when he gets that plum clinch on your neck.

992
00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:57.040
Oh my God.
He puts so much into those knees.
I'd like,

993
00:56:57.070 --> 00:57:00.910
I hadn't seen a guy knee somebody like Vandelay did in a long time.
Yeah.

994
00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:04.240
It was like the last one was um,

995
00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:09.560
<v 4>who the fuck kill a bee?
Ben Saunders.
Yeah.</v>

996
00:57:09.770 --> 00:57:13.570
Member he fought some dude and gave him a vicious barrage of needs.

997
00:57:13.571 --> 00:57:18.190
Like that dude was that,
I don't remember the Duty Fahd Hawaiian gentlemen,

998
00:57:18.191 --> 00:57:20.380
I believe.
Killaby Ben Saunders.

999
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:24.790
He's got some crazy rubber guard variation shit going on,
right?
Yeah.
And some,

1000
00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:25.780
some other technique.

1001
00:57:25.781 --> 00:57:30.781
We had his arm through it actually seeing Tiago Tavarez d play rubber guard in

1002
00:57:31.121 --> 00:57:35.710
that way.
Yeah.
But not successfully.
But he tried it a few times in the MC,

1003
00:57:36.070 --> 00:57:40.820
uh,
but a killer v Ben Saunders,
he was able to,
uh,

1004
00:57:41.130 --> 00:57:45.940
use that control very effectively against a high level Jujitsu guy,

1005
00:57:46.030 --> 00:57:46.870
a black belt.

1006
00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:49.710
I think he was a world champion as well and totally stuffed on many.

1007
00:57:49.711 --> 00:57:52.240
He did it over and over and over again throughout the fight.

1008
00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:57.530
So that I never play that style of rubber guard.
But,
um,
uh,

1009
00:57:58.150 --> 00:58:01.570
it's,
I mean eventually I'll,
I'll,
uh,
dive into it.

1010
00:58:01.571 --> 00:58:05.710
It just feels kind of uncomfortable for me right now,
but it's,
uh,
it's,

1011
00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:09.650
it's looked awesome on the hand.
Ben Always told me,
he said,
dude,

1012
00:58:09.651 --> 00:58:12.490
I can't wait for you to see my rubber guard,
man.
I got to kill the rubber guard.

1013
00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:14.530
He's been saying that for a couple of years.
I just haven't seen it.

1014
00:58:14.531 --> 00:58:16.070
He hasn't really been in a position

1015
00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:18.910
<v 1>that's probably the number one hole.</v>

1016
00:58:18.970 --> 00:58:22.090
If you had to pick like what's the most common whole the fighters have in their

1017
00:58:22.091 --> 00:58:26.560
game in MMA?
It's a guard,
right?
Wouldn't you say?
Yes,
absolutely.

1018
00:58:26.561 --> 00:58:29.050
Cause there's some dudes,
there's a few dudes that,
you know,

1019
00:58:29.051 --> 00:58:31.900
you go on the ground with them and like,
like a Vinnie Magallanes,

1020
00:58:32.170 --> 00:58:34.180
you go on the ground,
Vinny Magalhaes you get in his guard,

1021
00:58:34.181 --> 00:58:35.620
you're very likely to get fucked up.

1022
00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:39.260
<v 4>Yeah.
He's at least going to make it so you can dangerous.
Yeah.</v>

1023
00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:43.880
The Rubber Guard is,
is Ma,
you know,
it's,
it's defensive.

1024
00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:47.480
Uh,
powers are just,
I mean you can't,
if you,

1025
00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:51.590
if you're breaking your opponent down and you haven't been in Michigan troller

1026
00:58:51.591 --> 00:58:54.070
and visible color,
it's impossible for him to hurt you.
Yeah.

1027
00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:55.250
You're fully clenched,

1028
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:58.390
<v 1>you know,
and you know,
you wear them out,
try trying to get out of it.</v>

1029
00:58:58.590 --> 00:59:03.120
<v 4>Very hard to get out.
There's a lot of effort and it's,
it's really comes down to,</v>

1030
00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:03.840
you know,

1031
00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:08.840
MMA fighters have so much to do that don't have time to develop some new game.

1032
00:59:09.930 --> 00:59:14.010
And that crazy.
There's just so much to do because you got to do your kickboxing,

1033
00:59:14.130 --> 00:59:15.270
you got to do your wrestling,

1034
00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:17.760
and then you've got to do your Jujitsu and then you've got to run and then you

1035
00:59:17.761 --> 00:59:20.970
got to do your strength.
And conditioning.
There's so much to do.

1036
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:24.440
The only way you're going to get better at anything,

1037
00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:27.650
anything in life is by drilling,

1038
00:59:27.651 --> 00:59:31.820
in putting numbers in massive numbers,
drill,
drill,
drill,

1039
00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:37.010
and you don't,
there's just,
there's just no time to drill new positions.

1040
00:59:37.011 --> 00:59:39.350
When you're an MMA fighter,
he got so much to do.

1041
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:41.840
You know what happens is in striking,

1042
00:59:42.590 --> 00:59:46.040
that's all they do is drill because you can't really spar 100% all the time.

1043
00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:47.840
So if you want to work on,
you're striking,

1044
00:59:47.841 --> 00:59:50.840
you're going to be working on drills because you can't just go knocking out
your,

1045
00:59:51.050 --> 00:59:54.890
your training partners.
So you're forced to draw the time.

1046
00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:58.040
So you see these guys that are wrestlers them and within three years they're

1047
00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.040
striking is tremendous.
I mean,

1048
01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:03.710
Frankie Edgar's like a professional kickboxer you're seeing these guy Dominick

1049
01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:05.900
Cruz because in,
when they're working on the striking,

1050
01:00:05.901 --> 01:00:09.530
they have to work on their drills.
That's all there is.
When Jujitsu,

1051
01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:13.640
they look at a different,
at most MMA fighters will,
will,
uh,
they'll,

1052
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:16.640
they'll just roll and work on their Jujitsu.
Maybe it's more fun.
Yeah,

1053
01:00:16.641 --> 01:00:20.940
they'll just roll and cause you invite the role for people.
No,
mean spar,
spar,

1054
01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:21.680
it's,

1055
01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:26.480
it's so Jujitsu's the only sport that you could spar a hundred percent and,

1056
01:00:26.481 --> 01:00:29.420
and,
and,
and no one gets hurt really.
I mean,

1057
01:00:29.421 --> 01:00:33.940
and you're practicing tapping your opponent out 100%.
You can act,

1058
01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:36.380
you can't do that with kickboxing.
You just can't.

1059
01:00:36.381 --> 01:00:39.860
So what ends up happening in Jujitsu,
there's not that much drilling.

1060
01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:44.840
There's not that much working on spending time working on new techniques.

1061
01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:49.880
It's just sparring with punches and sparring is very important and very,

1062
01:00:49.881 --> 01:00:54.260
very,
you got to do that.
But you also to add weapons to your Jujitsu,

1063
01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:56.720
to just pile them on,
add different submissions.

1064
01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:59.660
You have to set time aside to just drill,

1065
01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:04.610
put the numbers in to these submission holds that you want to add to your game.

1066
01:01:04.790 --> 01:01:07.670
If you're not a,
um,
a guillotine master,

1067
01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:09.470
it's not because the guillotine doesn't work.

1068
01:01:09.471 --> 01:01:12.560
There's plenty of people out there that are proven the guilt and you get really

1069
01:01:12.561 --> 01:01:15.500
good at it.
Man.
It's a dangerous weapon.
If you're drilling teen isn't good.

1070
01:01:15.501 --> 01:01:16.334
You need to put,

1071
01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:20.270
you need a practice that over and over and over again and no one does.

1072
01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:20.820
There's just,

1073
01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:25.820
when in MMA there's just not enough time to set 20 minutes aside every other day

1074
01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:30.650
to work on a new submission holds into to sharpen him up,
you know?

1075
01:01:30.651 --> 01:01:35.651
So that's really the problem is they're just not enough time to practice new

1076
01:01:35.661 --> 01:01:36.430
move.
Yeah,

1077
01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:41.430
it's often for a fighter it's maybe sometimes the best thing is to come to MMA

1078
01:01:42.681 --> 01:01:45.770
with is one thing where you're super awesome at it,

1079
01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:48.620
whether it's judo or kickboxing,

1080
01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:53.750
one thing that you're already awesome and then sort of incorporate all the other

1081
01:01:53.751 --> 01:01:55.310
stuff into it,
you know,

1082
01:01:55.400 --> 01:02:00.260
because it seems like it's real hard for a guy to be learning everything and be

1083
01:02:00.261 --> 01:02:04.040
awesome at anything.
It's real hard.
It's real hard to,
you know,

1084
01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:08.960
it's like to reach a Damien Maia Jujitsu level when Damien Maia was just pure

1085
01:02:08.961 --> 01:02:11.300
Jujitsu,
you know,
to reach that level.

1086
01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:16.010
It's so hard to be doing that while you're trying to be a great kickboxer.

1087
01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:20.280
And also trying to be a great wrestler was Damien is just

1088
01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:24.240
<v 5>concentrate only on positions and submissions and bang,
Bang,
Bang.</v>

1089
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:26.470
He's going through numbers on you and you,

1090
01:02:26.471 --> 01:02:30.090
you you're adding in all this other stuff and when you add in all of this stuff,

1091
01:02:30.091 --> 01:02:32.790
you just don't have the time to put it in the kind of focus that he has.

1092
01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:35.400
It's almost like you're better off coming in

1093
01:02:36.590 --> 01:02:39.430
<v 4>in with one specialty.
You know,</v>

1094
01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:42.400
generally wrestling is probably the best,

1095
01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:47.460
although a lot of other sports do translate beautifully into MMA grappling.

1096
01:02:47.891 --> 01:02:52.240
Especially like if you played soccer your whole life,
it man,
you're,
you're,

1097
01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:54.630
you're,
you can learn Jujitsu really quick and,

1098
01:02:54.631 --> 01:02:56.890
and excel really quick in the same thing with striking.

1099
01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:58.450
If you play football your whole life,

1100
01:02:58.690 --> 01:03:01.780
you're used to beat your explosiveness is that are,
you know,

1101
01:03:01.781 --> 01:03:06.310
at at the highest levels and Capoeira and break dancing.

1102
01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:09.670
All that stuff translates cause in break dancing,

1103
01:03:09.970 --> 01:03:11.500
the kind of stuff they're doing nowadays,

1104
01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:16.710
it's just the amount of balance needed to pull these moves off off the chart.

1105
01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:19.540
It's way more balanced required than wrestling and wrestling.

1106
01:03:19.541 --> 01:03:20.440
You need a lot of balance,

1107
01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:24.940
but in breakdancing you got to spin and flip and land on one had all this

1108
01:03:24.941 --> 01:03:28.750
balance.
So yeah,
when they need to teach them Jujitsu,
it's,

1109
01:03:28.810 --> 01:03:32.050
they're like all I gotta do to stay on top and not get swept.
Oh my God,

1110
01:03:32.051 --> 01:03:36.850
this is easy.
It's easy season balance.
Bill Cooper is a,

1111
01:03:36.851 --> 01:03:38.590
is a prime example of that.

1112
01:03:38.591 --> 01:03:42.850
Bill Cooper is one of the greatest American Jujitsu players and he's been a

1113
01:03:42.851 --> 01:03:46.570
break dancers whole life.
And you know,
it wasn't a shocker.
Well it,
you know,

1114
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:47.860
I didn't find out to recently,

1115
01:03:47.861 --> 01:03:51.640
but it's no surprise that he went out and just dominated the American scene in

1116
01:03:51.641 --> 01:03:54.610
Jujitsu and he's doing MMA now too.
And um,
uh,
uh,

1117
01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:59.410
there's a Jujitsu guy named Cabrina who did cop a wearer,
which is like,
you know,

1118
01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:02.980
African or a Brazilian like dancing,
fighting type thing.

1119
01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:06.790
And they do all these crazy flips his,
and he did cover where his whole life,

1120
01:04:06.791 --> 01:04:10.360
he started Jujitsu in his early twenties and now he's amazing.

1121
01:04:10.361 --> 01:04:15.130
He's one of the best Jujitsu guys on,
on the planet at his weight.
Um,

1122
01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:19.120
and he'll tell you that it's from the Capoeira,
like all that Bouncy,

1123
01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:23.640
such an amazing athlete,
that Jujitsu Jujitsu's easy to them.
You know,

1124
01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.070
<v 5>it totally makes sense.
You know,</v>

1125
01:04:25.071 --> 01:04:29.330
I would think that anybody who does gymnastics or yes,
yes.
That translate.
Yes,

1126
01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:30.620
for sure.
Totally translate.
Yeah.

1127
01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:33.590
<v 4>Yeah,
for sure.
Like you know,</v>

1128
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:36.640
I have a son coming and he'll be coming in March.
I'm a,

1129
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:38.720
I'm a get him into all that stuff.

1130
01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:43.460
I'm going to try to get him into break dancing,
gymnastics,
wrestling for sure.

1131
01:04:43.590 --> 01:04:45.500
<v 5>The other thing is,
uh,
when you,</v>

1132
01:04:45.501 --> 01:04:50.190
you can develop really high level striking and then develop takedowns that's the

1133
01:04:50.191 --> 01:04:53.580
other terrifying fighter.
Like the guys like Anderson,
you know,

1134
01:04:53.581 --> 01:04:57.600
like you should know Cami fight.
Yeah.
Cause he had some sick take down defense.

1135
01:04:57.601 --> 01:05:01.320
Yup.
And then you're forced to stand up with him and that's a goddamn disaster.

1136
01:05:01.490 --> 01:05:02.930
Yeah.
You know,
that's that,

1137
01:05:02.931 --> 01:05:07.410
that's the other style and the only way you can get to be as good as Anderson is

1138
01:05:07.411 --> 01:05:12.330
it striking is I believe you have to focus purely on striking for a long time.

1139
01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.520
Yeah.
You know,
an Anderson was,
you know,

1140
01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:17.890
pretty much a Moy Thai initially.

1141
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:19.540
<v 4>You know,
until I think it was,</v>

1142
01:05:19.930 --> 01:05:22.960
I think it was really like the Nogueira brothers before he really put his ground

1143
01:05:22.961 --> 01:05:25.290
game together.
Right.
That's after,

1144
01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:27.910
I mean he had to ground a little bit of a ground game for shoot box,

1145
01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:29.910
but I see a lot of guys out there.

1146
01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:34.690
You see it in their career early there were easy to take down.

1147
01:05:34.691 --> 01:05:38.440
Then they'd gotten a little harder.
Now they're almost impossible to take down.

1148
01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:42.010
You see the progression.
You see the progression of the striking.
Yeah.
You know,

1149
01:05:42.011 --> 01:05:46.570
you see them getting a lot better.
I mean quick because all they do is drill.

1150
01:05:46.571 --> 01:05:49.660
I can wrestling.
Those are just drills.
Wrestling is just mostly drills,
you know,

1151
01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:53.860
he imagine how,
how long it would take to get good at throwing combinations.

1152
01:05:53.890 --> 01:05:56.290
If you never drilled in you all you did with spar,

1153
01:05:56.710 --> 01:06:00.310
like you would never develop any kind of combos.
You never,

1154
01:06:00.311 --> 01:06:04.990
it would be impossible all you did flow.
Yeah.
We'll just be really basic stuff.

1155
01:06:04.991 --> 01:06:07.060
They want to be crisp.
The technique would be terrible.

1156
01:06:07.061 --> 01:06:08.050
If you think of like a one,

1157
01:06:08.051 --> 01:06:11.140
two left hook to the body that you practice over and over on the back of that,

1158
01:06:11.141 --> 01:06:14.830
ma'am,
how are you ever going to pull that off list randomly in real life?

1159
01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:17.530
You know,
you would,
you would even think like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1160
01:06:17.531 --> 01:06:20.050
You'd have to learn it first learner first,

1161
01:06:20.051 --> 01:06:23.470
develop the movement and then start doing it.
It's the beauty of Jujitsu.

1162
01:06:23.471 --> 01:06:28.471
Jujitsu is so amazing and so awesome because you can spar 100% and no one gets

1163
01:06:28.811 --> 01:06:32.140
hurt and you're actually working on killing techniques and bone breaking

1164
01:06:32.141 --> 01:06:36.640
techniques.
It's,
it's like paintball for hand to hand combat.

1165
01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:41.440
It's so much fun.
You can actually spar.
You can't do that with any other,

1166
01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:42.130
uh,

1167
01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:47.130
as a combat sport that it's so cool and so awesome that people don't drill as

1168
01:06:48.161 --> 01:06:51.460
much as they should.
Especially in MMA especially.
You don't,

1169
01:06:51.610 --> 01:06:54.100
you don't see fighters like,
oh,

1170
01:06:54.130 --> 01:06:57.160
early in his career he was going at these two submissions and then in the middle

1171
01:06:57.161 --> 01:07:00.220
of his career he added these two and then towards the end he started hitting

1172
01:07:00.221 --> 01:07:04.480
these in these that you never see that you never see them.
The only,

1173
01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:09.600
the only one guy that I did see evolve and add different submissions is

1174
01:07:11.471 --> 01:07:16.270
Nogueira.
No,
in the beginning was the triangle king earliness careers.
Like,
man,

1175
01:07:16.271 --> 01:07:19.540
this big dude has a great guard.
He's triangling everybody.

1176
01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:22.720
Then you didn't see triangles for while and then he started Anaconda choking

1177
01:07:22.721 --> 01:07:26.380
people,
you know,
and throw on some gear teens.
So you saw that,
oh damn,

1178
01:07:26.381 --> 01:07:30.220
he's getting good at Anaconda chunks now you see that because he had some of the

1179
01:07:30.221 --> 01:07:33.900
dopest Anaconda chokes and MMA that takes,
he's tiring.

1180
01:07:33.970 --> 01:07:37.600
That takes us right to Bob Sapp.
Nogueira how perfect was that?

1181
01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:41.320
You got that to you up?
Listen,
we're going to play this fight.
We were,

1182
01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:45.190
Eddie and I are talking about all time great fights and we,
we,
we uh,

1183
01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:48.840
played a Kimbo slice versus tank Abbott fight on my phone.

1184
01:07:48.850 --> 01:07:51.550
We weren't sure if they fought and we played it on my phone,
uh,

1185
01:07:51.570 --> 01:07:54.880
outside of legends in Hollywood where we trained and uh,
we will,

1186
01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:58.870
we were just doing commentary why it was going on and we were like,
damn,

1187
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:02.020
you know,
this is a fight that we forgot even happened.
You know,

1188
01:08:02.021 --> 01:08:05.030
it's cool to watch like an old fight.
So we're going to watch,
uh,

1189
01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.670
we haven't seen it.
I haven't seen in a long time.

1190
01:08:06.671 --> 01:08:09.010
We're going to do our best impression [inaudible] and butthead,

1191
01:08:09.070 --> 01:08:11.680
watching a fly conic fight in MMA.

1192
01:08:11.770 --> 01:08:13.810
This is one of the most iconic fights of all time.

1193
01:08:14.810 --> 01:08:16.820
Minotauro Nogueira versus Bob Sapp.

1194
01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:20.180
<v 8>Bob Sab was the biggest human being to ever walk the face of the earth.</v>

1195
01:08:20.210 --> 01:08:24.110
He doesn't even look real in this video.
It's like 350 pounds.
All muscle,

1196
01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:25.250
all muscles fighting,

1197
01:08:25.251 --> 01:08:30.110
the Jujitsu God Noguera who's only about to hear about two 20 and right now he

1198
01:08:30.111 --> 01:08:30.861
gets piled,

1199
01:08:30.861 --> 01:08:35.861
drived on his head first move and this big giant guys on top of him punching him

1200
01:08:36.441 --> 01:08:39.320
over and over and over again.
And he's picking them up again,

1201
01:08:39.530 --> 01:08:41.430
trying to slam him down.
And no,

1202
01:08:41.431 --> 01:08:46.190
Gerome literally is maybe 150 pounds lighter than this dude.

1203
01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:48.590
I'll never forget,
this is one of those fights were actually,

1204
01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:49.850
remember what I was thinking?

1205
01:08:49.851 --> 01:08:51.740
I remember what I was saying while I was watching it.

1206
01:08:51.741 --> 01:08:54.650
We're watching it at Larry's house and I kept going at this point,

1207
01:08:54.651 --> 01:08:57.650
once he started getting pile driven,
I kept going.
We were so,

1208
01:08:57.950 --> 01:09:01.700
we were all just yelling and screaming during all of this and I kept thinking,

1209
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:05.420
I kept saying he's,
he's just too big.
He's too big.

1210
01:09:05.421 --> 01:09:09.020
There's no way he's going to pull this off.
He's just way too fucking big.

1211
01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:12.980
It looks like a molestation.
Oh,
the member where the lights went out,

1212
01:09:12.981 --> 01:09:16.990
the lights from out in the middle of the fight.
They kept fighting to bookies.

1213
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.650
Did that.
Yeah.
Cut The lights to light.
That's hilarious.

1214
01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:27.290
And so Minataro at the time,
uh,
wasn't even the heavyweight champion yet,
right?

1215
01:09:27.410 --> 01:09:29.540
Who was just coming up?
I don't remember that.

1216
01:09:29.541 --> 01:09:31.820
I don't remember if he was the chair and burnout.
I remember either.

1217
01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:34.550
But Minataro had a,
a wicked triangle.

1218
01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:39.110
He triangled everybody triangle Mark Coleman has guard was nasty back in the
day.

1219
01:09:39.111 --> 01:09:44.111
He was like the first real heavyweight submission bad-ass off his back.

1220
01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:49.210
He was the first guy to just put people to sleep.
He was my hero.
He was my hero.

1221
01:09:49.211 --> 01:09:49.490
I'm like,

1222
01:09:49.490 --> 01:09:54.470
finally we have a a big Jujitsu guy who can finish people off as back.

1223
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:58.490
We didn't have that.
That's so rare.
There was no other Brazilian elders.

1224
01:09:58.550 --> 01:10:02.900
All the legends that none of them were known for finishing people off their back

1225
01:10:02.901 --> 01:10:05.090
in MMA,
in Jujitsu tournaments.

1226
01:10:05.091 --> 01:10:08.750
Then we felt finishing off their back all the time sweeping but an MMA.

1227
01:10:08.751 --> 01:10:12.890
They weren't doing it and Nogueira was the first one to consistently Finnish

1228
01:10:12.891 --> 01:10:15.620
people off his back and now he's leg kicking him now.

1229
01:10:15.621 --> 01:10:17.630
They stood up and he shoots on him.

1230
01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:23.060
I mean he is literally 150 pounds bigger.
Bob Sapp is so big,

1231
01:10:23.061 --> 01:10:26.590
it doesn't even look real man.
He doesn't look anything like this,
anything.

1232
01:10:26.591 --> 01:10:30.860
I had no hope at this point.
I go,
he's done.
He's about to get just smashed.

1233
01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:32.210
I thought it was over.

1234
01:10:32.211 --> 01:10:36.680
So now Bob Sapp is trying to get know Garrett and a good team from half guard,

1235
01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:40.700
but he doesn't know what he's doing and he's playing around in minute Taros

1236
01:10:40.701 --> 01:10:44.930
guard and he's getting tired.
Now the thing about a guy that big,

1237
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:48.470
there's no way his heart is proportionate to his body.

1238
01:10:48.710 --> 01:10:52.970
His heart is like having a four cylinder engine,
you know,
trying to push a semi,

1239
01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:57.080
you know there's too much mass,
you know,
and he's getting crushed here.

1240
01:10:57.081 --> 01:10:59.510
He's getting stomped on.
Minataro is on the bottom.

1241
01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:01.520
They're just saying no hope at this point.

1242
01:11:01.521 --> 01:11:02.510
Like what is it going to be able to do?

1243
01:11:02.511 --> 01:11:04.130
He hasn't been able to get close to doing anything.

1244
01:11:04.131 --> 01:11:09.020
He can't even wrap his legs around his shoulders and Bob Sapp is so fucking

1245
01:11:09.021 --> 01:11:12.470
strong.
He landed a one two.
I'm going to,
Tara was trying to box with him now.

1246
01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:17.070
No Bob Sapp throat.
Those are real slow kick now.

1247
01:11:17.071 --> 01:11:20.910
Mandatorial tees off with the combination and Bob Sapp pushes him.

1248
01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:25.860
Bob Sapp is so fucking big man.
God Damn,
he looks fake.

1249
01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:30.070
<v 3>Two minutes Horrow was throwing,
I forgot about that.
He was thrown down.
He said,</v>

1250
01:11:30.071 --> 01:11:32.500
fuck it.
I'm going to stand with this dude and just give it all I have.

1251
01:11:32.501 --> 01:11:35.160
That's what he did.
He just,
he just going for it right here,
man.

1252
01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:38.700
<v 8>The size of Bob Sapp,
he looks fake man</v>

1253
01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:46.830
and him and Minotauro Boxing.
Now football players aren't even that big.

1254
01:11:46.831 --> 01:11:49.710
Three films.
Muscle.
That's a cartoon man.

1255
01:11:50.130 --> 01:11:53.940
He really does look like a character in a,
in a,
in an animated TV show.

1256
01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:57.210
He's trying to take town bombs that,
that's hilarious.

1257
01:11:57.470 --> 01:12:00.930
Editorials trying to take him down,
but you can get out.
But he sits out.

1258
01:12:00.931 --> 01:12:02.850
Look at that.
Oh,
that one.
Oh my goodness.

1259
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:06.630
And now I'm going to Charles on top and now he gets right to side control.

1260
01:12:06.631 --> 01:12:08.220
And this was that.
Everybody was going crazy.

1261
01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:12.200
<v 3>Crazy.
We were screaming.
There's amazing.</v>

1262
01:12:12.201 --> 01:12:16.460
He finally got on top of them.
This is the only hope here is his only hope.

1263
01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:21.820
<v 8>And Bob Sapp turns over and puts me in a Toro and his guard Minataro oh,</v>

1264
01:12:21.821 --> 01:12:24.910
he's throwing some crazy up kicks now man.
The bill passes.
God again.

1265
01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:27.610
It looked like he landed a couple of those 10.
Yeah.
It looked like he dead.

1266
01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:30.700
Minataro the other thing about Minataro was Goddamn,
he can take it.

1267
01:12:31.090 --> 01:12:35.230
He could take it better than anybody,
man.
Yeah.
Fay door pounded on him for that.

1268
01:12:36.430 --> 01:12:40.780
Take it too.
Especially earlier in his career.
Like these days,
you know?

1269
01:12:41.310 --> 01:12:42.143
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1270
01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:47.060
<v 3>These days when he was young.
Did we ever go nuts right here?
Yeah,
go nuts.</v>

1271
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:51.500
Like is he going to be able to pull this off?
He's got to do it here.

1272
01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:53.870
Like he had to do it here.
He knew it.
He knew this is it.

1273
01:12:54.010 --> 01:12:54.843
<v 9>Oh,</v>

1274
01:12:57.330 --> 01:12:59.970
<v 8>what happened?
The referee is separate in the action right now.</v>

1275
01:13:01.530 --> 01:13:03.950
Bob Saps got a little cut to cut to

1276
01:13:05.730 --> 01:13:10.650
some editorial,
gets a stand up and relax while they,
in Japan,

1277
01:13:10.651 --> 01:13:11.401
if you have a cut,

1278
01:13:11.401 --> 01:13:15.000
they stopped the action almost immediately and the doctors actually stopped the

1279
01:13:15.001 --> 01:13:15.834
bleeding.

1280
01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:20.840
The doctor's ringside actually like we'll stop the bleeding and put towels on it

1281
01:13:21.181 --> 01:13:24.630
and wait and then,
then they determine whether or not the guy can go back in.

1282
01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:29.280
So for a fight or sometimes you know,
it gives them a nice break.

1283
01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:30.840
<v 9>Okay.</v>

1284
01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:34.770
<v 8>In America,
they don't do this.
Now.
All right that no,
the doctors don't,</v>

1285
01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:37.660
the doctors aren't coming in and taking a look at a cut and stop the bleeding.

1286
01:13:37.661 --> 01:13:41.670
If doctors don't put like coagulants on it.
Right,
don't they?
I mean,

1287
01:13:41.671 --> 01:13:46.050
that's good question,
right?
I think so.
I mean,

1288
01:13:46.051 --> 01:13:49.260
do they put coagulants on it and pride and they put them in the same,

1289
01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.780
did they put Vaseline on them or are they just wipe it off

1290
01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:56.670
so they put them back in the same spot where I'm in a tar was wasn't side

1291
01:13:56.671 --> 01:13:57.504
control.

1292
01:13:58.590 --> 01:13:59.790
<v 9>Google Middle Charles</v>

1293
01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:01.770
<v 8>got a nice head and arm right here.</v>

1294
01:14:06.450 --> 01:14:10.460
Bob Sab was exhausted by this point.
He's just,
it's so crazy.

1295
01:14:10.461 --> 01:14:11.470
How tired gets

1296
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:18.790
he reverses and Bob Cyber Versus,
Oh man,
look at that into side control.

1297
01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:21.670
Wow.
That was awesome.
I looked over at this point.
It's like,
okay.

1298
01:14:21.671 --> 01:14:25.780
That was his chance.
He just blew it to just blew it.
Now to over.

1299
01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:30.160
This is an all time classic fight.
Bob Stops hitting them with some hammer fists.

1300
01:14:30.161 --> 01:14:34.060
Bob Sapp Sky's back.
Oh my goodness.
Bob says trying to choke him.

1301
01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:40.000
Oh my God.
He Hammerfest some.
Oh.
Oh,

1302
01:14:40.030 --> 01:14:44.860
he's getting beat.
Bob.
Bob Sapp is gigantic.
My God,
he's struck.
Oh Shit.

1303
01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:50.020
Oh my God,
Dude.
He's like a fucking video game character.
Look at him back then.

1304
01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:54.910
Look at this.
He's running and trying to stomp on them.
Pride at some crazy rules,

1305
01:14:54.911 --> 01:14:59.200
man.
You were allowed to just jump on.
Dudes

1306
01:15:01.290 --> 01:15:05.130
jump out of their head bright at some nutty rules,
man,
and now,

1307
01:15:05.150 --> 01:15:09.370
right now he's on side control.
He's Bob Saps on top of them and Minataro again,

1308
01:15:09.371 --> 01:15:14.320
150 pounds fucking lighter than him and this the biggest human ever is

1309
01:15:14.321 --> 01:15:16.090
underneath them and he's still hip escaping.

1310
01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:20.740
He's hip escaping right now and Bob's have punches him in the head and he gets

1311
01:15:20.741 --> 01:15:21.574
to half guard.

1312
01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:29.680
I don't remember how he gets out of this
is getting blasted.

1313
01:15:29.710 --> 01:15:33.670
Oh my God.
Bob Sat SAP just hit him with two haymakers.

1314
01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:38.350
Jesus,
you look at his arms.
How much bust those punches hurt,
man.

1315
01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:43.410
Oh my God.
He dropped some hammer fist on his chest.
This point,

1316
01:15:43.450 --> 01:15:47.080
Bob Sapp seem unstar he goes for the arm bar here.
No,

1317
01:15:47.081 --> 01:15:50.800
he went in front the triangle.
Wow.
You used to go for risk control triangle,

1318
01:15:50.801 --> 01:15:52.000
but he can't control that guy's risks.

1319
01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:54.610
There's no way he could put a triangle on on those shoulders.

1320
01:15:54.611 --> 01:15:57.700
There's no way it can fit.
Right.
Impossible,
really.
Right.
No Way.

1321
01:15:57.701 --> 01:16:01.660
Look at those shoulders here.
Crazy.
He's so big.
He's so big.

1322
01:16:01.661 --> 01:16:05.680
It's crazy how he just faded into obscurity.
Who I don't even think he'd be.

1323
01:16:05.681 --> 01:16:06.250
He'd be,

1324
01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:09.670
I don't think he could keep up this level of supplementation for very long.

1325
01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:14.470
He did great.
And K one for a second there.
Yeah,
he did.

1326
01:16:14.471 --> 01:16:19.420
He beat her Nesto who's twice bro.
Oh,
he's down again.
Yo.

1327
01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.910
He stopped Ernesto hoost think about that shit.

1328
01:16:21.970 --> 01:16:24.310
And that's the WHO's one of the greatest kick boxers ever.

1329
01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:29.860
And Bob Sapp just kind of beast fucked him.
You know?

1330
01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:32.940
What are the rumors that that was fixed?
I don't know.
I didn't,

1331
01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:35.140
I didn't hear that rumor.
If that is,

1332
01:16:35.141 --> 01:16:37.330
if they did an amazing job and making it look real.

1333
01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:40.720
I've seen some fights that are for sure fixed.

1334
01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:47.260
Oh yeah.
Mark Coleman Takata are,
ya'll didn't want to say that,
but oh,
nice.

1335
01:16:47.261 --> 01:16:50.530
Right hand.
And the throwing down.
This is so crazy.

1336
01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:55.060
It just does,
does not look like it should be happening.

1337
01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:58.320
That a guy that big should be fighting against a guy that much smaller than
them.

1338
01:17:00.610 --> 01:17:02.320
This is the cool thing about pride though.

1339
01:17:02.321 --> 01:17:05.980
They would put on these freak show fights like this and they would,
you know,

1340
01:17:05.981 --> 01:17:09.800
it would be really interesting to see like you remember when fade or Fada that

1341
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:14.690
huge dude.
What the Hell's his name?
Hung Man.
Troy.
Yup.
Remember that?

1342
01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:18.860
Yup.
Oh my God.
Oh,
he's going to triangle triangle.
No Way.

1343
01:17:18.861 --> 01:17:22.670
He's going to pick his ass up and slap.
The guy picked him up and slammed him.

1344
01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:26.000
He was ferocious in this buy box.
Oh my God.
He was,

1345
01:17:26.001 --> 01:17:27.620
he's yelling at him and I'm like,
Nick Diaz,

1346
01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:31.730
this is when Bob Sapp was the shit man.
This is before Bob Sapp and you know,

1347
01:17:31.770 --> 01:17:35.780
got his eye socket broken by Cro cop and you know,
back then it was,

1348
01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:37.460
he was looking at crush everybody,
man.

1349
01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:41.480
Everybody was scared of Bob Sapp Shit.

1350
01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:44.630
Oh Dude.

1351
01:17:44.631 --> 01:17:49.000
Bob Sapp just punched him with a serious fucking right hand and now I'm going to

1352
01:17:49.001 --> 01:17:49.161
Tara.

1353
01:17:49.161 --> 01:17:52.340
I was really trying to get them down and if he gets him down then Bob Sapp is

1354
01:17:52.341 --> 01:17:53.174
fucked.

1355
01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:54.073
<v 9>Nope.</v>

1356
01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:55.540
<v 8>Linda Tyler.</v>

1357
01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:58.550
I was still in the bottom middle tars bleeding now is checking his face.

1358
01:17:59.390 --> 01:18:03.980
The big ass cut on his cheek.
Bob Sam was over him.

1359
01:18:06.030 --> 01:18:07.340
<v 9>Hold on.</v>

1360
01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:11.570
<v 8>God Damn.
I bet he is.
It doesn't look real right.</v>

1361
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:13.930
He really doesn't look like a human being.

1362
01:18:13.931 --> 01:18:18.580
He looks like an animated character in a hobbit movie and now admitted Tara is

1363
01:18:18.581 --> 01:18:23.230
going for a leg lock here.
Tara is going for a leg lock here.

1364
01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:28.210
That's a good idea against big guys because generally they're not very good at

1365
01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:30.070
defending leg locks.

1366
01:18:31.170 --> 01:18:36.170
Mineral wool man gets everybody where he'll hugs and Minataro is now on his back

1367
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:39.910
and Bob Saps on top of him and I was trying to hold on to a wrist.

1368
01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:42.700
He's got to rests here.
Oh,
what the fuck?

1369
01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:44.233
<v 9>Why?</v>

1370
01:18:44.850 --> 01:18:47.220
<v 8>We'll go to part two.
There must be a part two.</v>

1371
01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:49.853
<v 9>Yeah</v>

1372
01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:53.600
<v 8>Dude,
the tension,
it's killing me.
That's an all time classic.</v>

1373
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:57.410
An all time classic for people who don't know.
That was like a,

1374
01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.600
it was almost like,

1375
01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:05.210
it had always been the question like how big could a guy being your Jujitsu

1376
01:19:05.211 --> 01:19:09.350
still works?
You know,
there's always those questions and some guys would say,
no,

1377
01:19:09.351 --> 01:19:12.230
he's too big.
You can't even use Jujitsu on them.
You can't use it.

1378
01:19:12.231 --> 01:19:15.860
He can't cancel minimum.
And that was,
uh,
you know,

1379
01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:18.080
a lot of people were thinking about pop SAP.
Like,
man,

1380
01:19:18.230 --> 01:19:22.220
how would you submit this guy?
Look at the size.
Oh,
but look at him.
Breathe man.

1381
01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:25.250
He's hyperventilating,
right?
Yeah.
He was panicking.

1382
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:30.080
He needs to learn some of that.
Steve Maxwell breathing puff,
puff,

1383
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:34.730
puff,
got to control your breath son.
And now they're checking,

1384
01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:35.583
um,

1385
01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:40.610
Mataros face cause he's got a cut and the Japanese shows the doctors would

1386
01:19:40.611 --> 01:19:42.470
actually stop the bleeding like this.

1387
01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:45.100
Another checking his eyes too to make sure he could still see.

1388
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:51.990
Yeah,
they put some coagulant on it,
it looks like.

1389
01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:59.150
Yeah.
Minataro I thought he'd,
uh,
I forgot it took so much damage.

1390
01:19:59.180 --> 01:19:59.721
Did you remember?

1391
01:19:59.721 --> 01:20:04.640
He took so much damage this I remembered it as being a shorter fight.
Yeah,

1392
01:20:04.641 --> 01:20:06.800
me too.
Me Too.
Yeah,
I didn't,

1393
01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:11.130
he was getting his ass kicked like several times in the fight.
Well,

1394
01:20:11.131 --> 01:20:14.520
it's also one of the things that was kind of wild about pride was that 10 minute

1395
01:20:14.521 --> 01:20:18.990
first round,
that 10 minutes.
First round was a mother fucker man.
10 minutes.

1396
01:20:18.991 --> 01:20:22.920
It's crazy.
10 minutes is nuts.
And what else?

1397
01:20:22.921 --> 01:20:24.090
Pride did one other thing,

1398
01:20:24.091 --> 01:20:28.380
pride did that I really like is that they judged the fight as a whole.

1399
01:20:28.381 --> 01:20:31.860
So the last part of the fight was like very important.

1400
01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:36.150
Who was waiting at the end was very important.
Like what?
How did it turn out?

1401
01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:39.870
Well,
if it turns out at the end,
you're kicking that person's ass.
Really.

1402
01:20:39.871 --> 01:20:40.620
If you know,

1403
01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:44.250
if you walked up on a street fight and at the end of it the guy was on top and

1404
01:20:44.251 --> 01:20:46.800
punching the guy in the face,
that guy's the winter,
you know?

1405
01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:50.220
And he's getting his ass kicked again.
Who's this tall,

1406
01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:54.960
big hammer fisted by this enormous human being.
Oh,

1407
01:20:54.961 --> 01:20:57.360
he's getting killed.
You got to see this folks,

1408
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:59.970
even if you're not a Jujitsu or an MMA fan,

1409
01:21:00.090 --> 01:21:03.330
just see this for the human spectacle of it cause it's so ridiculous.

1410
01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:06.180
The round ended,
I didn't even know the round ended.
Yeah,

1411
01:21:06.510 --> 01:21:09.690
so this is a second round.
Yep.
Wow.

1412
01:21:10.290 --> 01:21:13.200
It ends early in the second round and he goes back and look at that.

1413
01:21:13.201 --> 01:21:17.670
He's with Mario.
Fucking scary dude.
This is classic stuff.
That was his new boy.

1414
01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:20.640
He was bringing up,
God damn.

1415
01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:23.230
<v 9>Okay,
hold on.</v>

1416
01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:25.650
<v 8>He got dropped on his head,
dude.</v>

1417
01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:29.340
Remember when Gilbert Ivo got knocked out but Gilbert have all knocked out?

1418
01:21:29.341 --> 01:21:32.880
Gary Goodrich.
Yes.
Laid him out with that head kick,
laid them out.

1419
01:21:32.881 --> 01:21:37.230
He was asleep for like five minutes when he woke up.
This is an I worked at PRI.

1420
01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:42.240
When he woke up,
he,
this is what he told me.
He thought because he's from,

1421
01:21:42.270 --> 01:21:43.740
he's from Canada.

1422
01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:47.220
He thought when he was standing there with all the people on the music,

1423
01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:50.790
he thought he was at a rave in Toronto for an hour.

1424
01:21:51.170 --> 01:21:55.760
He thought he was at a reign and his sister,
which was,
who is Gary as sisters?

1425
01:21:55.770 --> 01:21:57.150
Always with them.
I got a spider.

1426
01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:01.110
He thought that was just some chick that he picked up at a rave in Toronto for

1427
01:22:01.111 --> 01:22:03.270
an hour.
He didn't even know it was the sister note.

1428
01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:06.660
He didn't know he was in Japan.
Oh Man.
He thought he was just fucked up on drugs.

1429
01:22:08.010 --> 01:22:12.930
That was gone.
Oh my God.
That's another classic bike.
That lots.
Here we go.

1430
01:22:13.770 --> 01:22:16.950
Round two.
This is the replay.
Oh Shit.
Okay.

1431
01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:20.070
Oh there's a pile drive.

1432
01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:24.360
Bam got hurt his neck and it bothered him for years.
Yeah.

1433
01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:29.400
So what I heard,
did he ever get it fixed?
Ah,
that's a good question.
I think so.

1434
01:22:29.490 --> 01:22:30.960
This fight might've ruined him.
Right

1435
01:22:34.270 --> 01:22:35.103
<v 9>man.</v>

1436
01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:36.560
<v 8>You know,</v>

1437
01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:40.760
who knows how good he could have been if he didn't take the donkey Kong shots.

1438
01:22:40.761 --> 01:22:44.480
He connected five or six straight hammer fist after hammer fist.

1439
01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:46.220
Do you think that this fight,

1440
01:22:46.221 --> 01:22:48.470
like the kind of beating that he took in this fight,
I mean,

1441
01:22:48.471 --> 01:22:50.240
you can only take so many of these meetings,

1442
01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:54.380
but this is a long time ago and he seems to be,
um,
okay,

1443
01:22:54.381 --> 01:22:55.850
now he seems to be,

1444
01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:02.250
well at the time he was like Jujitsu Savior.
Yeah.
You know,

1445
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:06.250
it was my biggest hero.
Yeah.

1446
01:23:06.251 --> 01:23:09.370
I remember you used to get so fired up and this dude would fight.

1447
01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:13.140
He has like finally a dude who can finish people off his back.
Yep.

1448
01:23:13.290 --> 01:23:17.200
I'm a big fan of that and know that,
oh,
I need tags.

1449
01:23:17.201 --> 01:23:19.900
Bob Sapp right in the beginning of the first round,
the second round,

1450
01:23:20.350 --> 01:23:23.920
he's in way better shape going into the second round and now he's moving around

1451
01:23:23.921 --> 01:23:28.120
at boxing.
Oh Shit.
He's throwing down,
dude.

1452
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:33.880
Oh,
he just got heavier than alive.
And while we're watching this,
I mean,

1453
01:23:34.450 --> 01:23:37.660
the crazy thing is the Japanese fans,
they hardly even cheer.

1454
01:23:37.661 --> 01:23:42.330
It's like real quiet,
respectful that I feel tired.

1455
01:23:43.410 --> 01:23:47.290
They have such a different way of,
uh,
appreciating fighting.
You know,

1456
01:23:47.710 --> 01:23:52.460
there are a lot louder now are they now know.
Americanized.
Yeah.
They're,
they're,

1457
01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:55.900
they're figuring out the Americans.
We did another culture.

1458
01:23:57.550 --> 01:23:59.290
We ruined their martial arts culture.

1459
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.290
They're yelling at shit.
I don't even know what it means.
Like kick his ass,

1460
01:24:05.291 --> 01:24:08.860
sea bass on that shit out and have no idea what it is.

1461
01:24:08.861 --> 01:24:11.790
Sort of like a white guys with Japanese tattoos.
Yeah.

1462
01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:14.500
Stand them up.

1463
01:24:14.501 --> 01:24:18.930
Rough [inaudible] means that's hilarious.

1464
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:22.780
There's been a couple of UFC.
I wish I had gone to the glory days of pride.

1465
01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:25.720
That's one of the things that I wish I saw you got to.
You were there,

1466
01:24:25.721 --> 01:24:30.160
you did commentary for the glory days,
man.
Pride 10.
Yeah.
Dude.

1467
01:24:30.161 --> 01:24:34.210
Who was the first card you,
uh,
you did commentary with?
Who's fine?

1468
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:39.830
Ooh.
Shit.
That was pride Tan.
That was uh,
Vandelay Silva gets Guy Mascara.

1469
01:24:40.230 --> 01:24:44.420
Great fight water fight.
Henzel Sakharova okay,
hold on.
Yeah.

1470
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:47.350
Hands up soccer robber.
Yeah.
Can you do this?
Do this,
do this.

1471
01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:50.500
He's locking in a bar.
Boom.
We got slammed.

1472
01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:54.040
He got slammed by Bob saps getting tired.
He's locking up a triangle.

1473
01:24:54.130 --> 01:24:57.490
You can't lock up the triangle.
No Way.
You can lock it up.
You can't lock it up.

1474
01:24:57.491 --> 01:25:01.780
He's going to have to switch.
I'm gonna switch to the arm bar.
Oh,
look at this.
Oh,

1475
01:25:01.781 --> 01:25:06.130
what did he do?
Oh Wow.
I'll see.
Mighty good guys.
Too Big.

1476
01:25:06.190 --> 01:25:09.550
Who has more heart than Nogueira?
No one.
No one ever.
Oh,
this is what he did.

1477
01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:14.080
He got them from this peak out.
Yeah.
You remember he reversed them this way?
Yeah.

1478
01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:17.980
He's,
he did it before.
Early in the fight.
It worked.
He peeked out,

1479
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:21.280
but he's tried it a couple times since then.
It hasn't worked,
I think.

1480
01:25:21.281 --> 01:25:24.790
I think that's how it gets done.
Yeah.
And now he's on his back.

1481
01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:29.110
Bob's house getting tired.
Oh my God.
It's so big.

1482
01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:36.130
So ridiculous.
No gears going for Kamora here.
I don't remember this.

1483
01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:40.690
I remember this at all.
Do you remember this?
I say Kamora this big dude.
Really?

1484
01:25:40.990 --> 01:25:44.660
Oh,
that's ready mountain from here.
Member.
He rolls them over with this Kamora.

1485
01:25:46.810 --> 01:25:50.270
He throws his,
when he,
when he's doing this,
he throws his left leg over the top.

1486
01:25:50.350 --> 01:25:55.150
That's how he gets them,
right?
Yeah,
yeah,

1487
01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:58.720
yeah.
He sweeps and with this.
Yep.
Yep,
Yep,
Yep.

1488
01:25:59.970 --> 01:26:04.550
Oh Man.
Come on.
God.
In a movie.
Oh my God.
He said boom.

1489
01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:09.260
Pops up.
Pushed him right off.
Oh my God.

1490
01:26:09.261 --> 01:26:12.860
He swept him for one second.
Oh,
but now he's got his arm.

1491
01:26:12.861 --> 01:26:15.890
His right arm is in deep.
His right arm was in deep.

1492
01:26:15.891 --> 01:26:17.060
If he can hold his wrist there,

1493
01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:23.650
his right arm's deep across is going to do it.
Oh,

1494
01:26:23.710 --> 01:26:28.690
he's trying a triangle and to try and triangulate this work,
son.
Oh my God.
Wow.

1495
01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:32.710
He's holding on to that risk though.
It's amazing.
The Bob Sapp is still has gas,

1496
01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:35.170
right?
It is amazing,
but this is it.
This is where he got them.

1497
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:41.230
That's I peaked out.
He's on top now.
Yeah.
Now.
Now he's in side control.
Oh my God.

1498
01:26:41.410 --> 01:26:42.940
And Bob Sapp can't breathe.

1499
01:26:43.630 --> 01:26:47.750
He can't breathe and now he's getting pounded on and they'll,

1500
01:26:47.790 --> 01:26:49.150
Garrett's punched him in the face.

1501
01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:51.130
<v 9>He's going to take that left arm.</v>

1502
01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:57.880
<v 8>That is incredible.
At the time,</v>

1503
01:26:58.030 --> 01:27:02.230
this was King Kong versus Godzilla man.
This was,

1504
01:27:03.250 --> 01:27:05.860
oh my God.
Then he sits back for the arm bar.

1505
01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:09.950
<v 3>Everyone's going nuts at Larry's house right now.
We were losing our minds.</v>

1506
01:27:09.970 --> 01:27:14.510
I'm like,
can you were screaming,
screaming?
Oh Man.
Oh

1507
01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:19.800
<v 8>Dude.
Right there was,
everybody was going ape shit.</v>

1508
01:27:20.730 --> 01:27:24.510
This was just a victory for technique.

1509
01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:29.980
A victory for Jujitsu.
That was a pure Jujitsu and end Nogueira.

1510
01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:34.080
You know Nogueira was like the perfect vehicle because he was so tough.
Dude.

1511
01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:36.690
That was the greatest fight of all time.
Yeah,
that's the greatest.

1512
01:27:36.810 --> 01:27:39.000
I think it's gotta be right up there.

1513
01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:42.030
It's gotta be right up there just for the sheer,
first of all,

1514
01:27:42.210 --> 01:27:44.370
the sheer fucking beating.

1515
01:27:44.371 --> 01:27:47.160
He went through man getting dumped on his head like that.

1516
01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:52.230
By that 350 370 pound guy smashes him down on his head like that.

1517
01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:55.490
Just to get through that man.
How'd that not put him out?
Almost

1518
01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:56.860
<v 3>hammer fist.
He got hit with,</v>

1519
01:27:57.340 --> 01:27:59.650
how about we were going to put them in that fuck bed.

1520
01:27:59.930 --> 01:28:04.930
A sketch we wrote for the man show over that he agreed to do it too.

1521
01:28:05.261 --> 01:28:09.570
It's right.
What was,
what were we going to say?
This sketch was the,

1522
01:28:09.770 --> 01:28:12.370
it was a commercial parody called the fuck bed.

1523
01:28:12.850 --> 01:28:17.230
And the commercial starts a really got guys banging some check this out

1524
01:28:17.231 --> 01:28:18.610
commercial,
sorry guys,
banging the chick.

1525
01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:23.490
The bed falls apart and it breaks and she goes,
you're a fucking asshole.

1526
01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:26.650
And grabs her shit and leaves and he looks at the camera's like,
Oh fuck,

1527
01:28:26.651 --> 01:28:28.990
you know,
it's bad brogue so that you come on,
he goes,

1528
01:28:28.991 --> 01:28:31.560
if this ever happened to you.
And then it's a,
it's a uh,

1529
01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:34.510
fuck bed that's built with,
uh,
for the frame.

1530
01:28:34.511 --> 01:28:38.440
It's like steel gurneys and the headboard was like Tatami mats and Shit.

1531
01:28:38.890 --> 01:28:41.770
And we're going to test it would tell you we're going to be like in a,
in a,

1532
01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:45.180
in those white coats,
testing it with a clipboard,
lab coat,
lab coat in.

1533
01:28:45.190 --> 01:28:45.820
There you go.

1534
01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:50.820
And Bob Sapp was going to be fucking blow up dolls testing the bed,

1535
01:28:51.781 --> 01:28:52.340
my fucking,

1536
01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:56.140
and then they'd be constantly blowing up and dudes giving them new blow up
dolls.

1537
01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:01.530
<v 8>Yeah.
And Bob sat was totally down to do it.
Yeah.
Damn.</v>

1538
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:05.760
<v 5>How the fuck,
that was another good you picked that.
Got kaboshed.</v>

1539
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.100
At the higher levels.
Yeah,
there's,
there was nobody like pop Sam,

1540
01:29:10.170 --> 01:29:12.660
Bob [inaudible] in his prime like that back in that fight.

1541
01:29:12.690 --> 01:29:15.720
That was a character in a movie.
Man.
He was a character in a movie.

1542
01:29:16.230 --> 01:29:20.940
He beat Ernesto hoost twice.
I mean,
you can take,
take,

1543
01:29:20.970 --> 01:29:25.260
you know,
say all,
we were so big and it was so much bigger.
That is true.

1544
01:29:25.261 --> 01:29:29.460
That is true.
That is true.
However,
it's Ernesto hoots and Ernesto,

1545
01:29:29.461 --> 01:29:32.970
who's dropped him and Lester,
who's dropped him with a fucking leg kick.

1546
01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:35.580
It dropped him once,
I think with a leg kick in once with a body shot.

1547
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.040
So it wasn't like he didn't sustain damage.

1548
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:40.410
He had a pull himself out of the fire to beat that guy.

1549
01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:45.030
He would have been perfect for WWE.
Right?
Fuck yeah.
Bob.
Slap God's man.

1550
01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:47.400
Vince Mcmahon is not doing his homework.
Well,

1551
01:29:47.401 --> 01:29:50.150
I just don't know how long you can stay that big.
You know,
it's,

1552
01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:54.110
you can't just stay that big forever in rock.
You know,

1553
01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:57.130
ones that big man.
No one's that bad.
Come on.
No one's ever,

1554
01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.760
no one's ever stayed that he wasn't that tall.
He was six,

1555
01:29:59.761 --> 01:30:04.050
four inches wide as hell.
Giant,
three 50 all muscle.

1556
01:30:04.150 --> 01:30:08.880
No Shit.
I've never seen a human being in life that was real,

1557
01:30:08.910 --> 01:30:12.150
that looked like Bob Sapp never,
there was nobody like him.

1558
01:30:13.410 --> 01:30:15.960
Just sheer size.
Like you could reach him,

1559
01:30:16.290 --> 01:30:19.980
he could put his arms out and just block everything you just said so much.
Man.

1560
01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:23.970
He got so famous in Japan,
he was like Michael Jackson famous.

1561
01:30:23.971 --> 01:30:25.470
He couldn't go anywhere.
When you go to Japan,

1562
01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:28.800
he would never leave his hotel room cause he sticks out like a sore thumb.
Yeah,

1563
01:30:28.801 --> 01:30:32.520
he would get mob left and right.
He was a huge,
huge star in Japan.

1564
01:30:32.670 --> 01:30:37.650
But apparently as time went on they started to having disagreements about,

1565
01:30:37.651 --> 01:30:40.680
you know,
financial issues and I don't know what happened,

1566
01:30:40.681 --> 01:30:42.570
but he walked out on a show,

1567
01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:45.750
they were trying to get him to fight without a contract or something like that.

1568
01:30:45.930 --> 01:30:48.720
And he said,
no,
I'm,
I'm wanting my contract first and then I'll fight.

1569
01:30:48.721 --> 01:30:51.300
And they said,
no,
no.
After the fight we'll give you a contract.
And he was like,

1570
01:30:51.301 --> 01:30:53.220
what?
Fuck this.
I'm leaving.

1571
01:30:53.221 --> 01:30:56.010
And so he left and then he was in trouble for a long time.

1572
01:30:56.220 --> 01:30:58.300
And that was sort of the last,
you know,

1573
01:30:58.410 --> 01:31:03.000
the last of the big Hurrah of Bob Sapp in Japan as you still fighting now.

1574
01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:05.250
I don't know where he's fighting though.
But you know,

1575
01:31:05.251 --> 01:31:10.251
in Japan that that run that he had when he was a huge national superstar,

1576
01:31:10.710 --> 01:31:14.370
you know,
he would sing songs and shit.
[inaudible]
he had like an album,

1577
01:31:14.430 --> 01:31:18.710
remember the commercial he did with the bananas?
Oh my God.
Yeah.
That was crazy.

1578
01:31:18.730 --> 01:31:22.590
Jap Japanese and racist.
Oh my God.
Not all of them.

1579
01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:27.450
I take that back.
They don't,
they don't understand some of the racist stuff that,

1580
01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:31.680
uh,
um,
the things that we would think are racist,

1581
01:31:31.710 --> 01:31:36.420
like Bob Sapp did up banana,
commercial.
Well,
I think,
yeah,

1582
01:31:36.450 --> 01:31:38.820
I think,
you know,
it's okay in their culture,

1583
01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:43.940
it's okay to like make a big Buckeye eat bananas because they don't have that

1584
01:31:44.101 --> 01:31:48.000
many big black guys over there.
So when,
when you have one for them,

1585
01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:52.380
they don't register how fucked up it is.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

1586
01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:56.730
I think also Japanese or like they,
they have,
they're really,
uh,

1587
01:31:57.030 --> 01:31:59.890
Japan centric,
you know,
Japanese people

1588
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:04.750
<v 1>really,
uh,
you know what I'm saying?
They,
they really focus on,</v>

1589
01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:08.350
on uh,
on other Japanese people.
I wouldn't say they're racist.

1590
01:32:09.210 --> 01:32:13.000
They have a lot of unity amongst,
I take that back.
I didn't mean they're racist.

1591
01:32:13.001 --> 01:32:17.710
I meant well that it w that commercial that they put Bob Sapp in eating those

1592
01:32:17.711 --> 01:32:21.240
bananas.
Oh,
in America.
That would have been,
but just think of all the,

1593
01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:23.590
all the other freaky shit they do thinking about like the little girl's

1594
01:32:23.591 --> 01:32:25.120
underwears are not little girls,

1595
01:32:25.121 --> 01:32:28.100
but chicks underwears rather that you can buy and dispensers,
you know,

1596
01:32:28.101 --> 01:32:29.870
right next to a coke machine and they,
they,

1597
01:32:29.871 --> 01:32:32.500
they're into some different next level shit.

1598
01:32:32.530 --> 01:32:36.260
They're obsessed with little school girls in their outfits.
Yeah,
man.
I mean,

1599
01:32:36.261 --> 01:32:39.800
they're different,
you know.
So who's to say I love him?

1600
01:32:40.860 --> 01:32:42.730
I mean in there,
maybe they'd be there.
Right.

1601
01:32:42.731 --> 01:32:47.410
Maybe it is funny to watch Bob beat a bunch of bananas.
Hello?
Okay.
I had,

1602
01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:52.690
you know,
but whatever it is,
he was a,
at one point in time,

1603
01:32:52.691 --> 01:32:56.710
he was one of the fucking biggest stars in the country.
One day we'll,

1604
01:32:56.770 --> 01:33:01.630
we'll see pictures of Bob Sapp skinny.
You think so?
Like one 90 yeah.

1605
01:33:02.610 --> 01:33:05.680
You can keep that shit up.
You ever looked at pictures of Dorian Yates?

1606
01:33:05.681 --> 01:33:10.360
Now you know Dorian Yates is black guy.
No,
no.
Dorian Yates.
Yeah,
he's the,

1607
01:33:10.361 --> 01:33:12.790
he was the English guy who was the Mr Olympia.

1608
01:33:13.300 --> 01:33:16.180
One of the fittest guys of all time,
dude.
And he's really skinny now.
Yeah.

1609
01:33:16.181 --> 01:33:18.130
Now he's like busted out on the,
on the Internet.

1610
01:33:18.610 --> 01:33:21.580
Look for a picture if you could find it.
Dorian.
Dorian Yates.

1611
01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:25.630
I mean he was just immense at one point in time.
He now he's skinny.
Yeah.

1612
01:33:25.631 --> 01:33:27.370
Nobody's normal sized,
you know,

1613
01:33:27.371 --> 01:33:29.410
and you don't see any pictures of him now with his shirt off.

1614
01:33:29.650 --> 01:33:31.020
I think some of these dudes when they retired,

1615
01:33:31.150 --> 01:33:34.930
they just don't lift weights anymore.
They're like,
fuck this,
I'm done.

1616
01:33:35.710 --> 01:33:40.660
And good luck getting your balls to work.
Right.
Good luck.
Good luck.
Good luck.

1617
01:33:40.661 --> 01:33:45.040
What'd you do?
You jacked him to 10.

1618
01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:47.440
See this is him when he was in his prime.

1619
01:33:47.441 --> 01:33:51.040
We're looking at pictures when he was in his prime.
I mean he was fucking amends,

1620
01:33:51.041 --> 01:33:55.660
man.
That's not even him at its biggest,
but look out fucking big ears man.

1621
01:33:56.020 --> 01:33:58.870
There was,
there was him when he got even bigger.
Cause these guys,

1622
01:33:58.871 --> 01:34:00.760
they have to keep getting bigger every year.

1623
01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:04.210
Everybody else gets bigger and they get more defined and you know,

1624
01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:05.920
guys take things to the next level.

1625
01:34:06.190 --> 01:34:11.190
It's like this right now is sort of not that big in comparison to how guys look

1626
01:34:11.801 --> 01:34:15.430
today.
You know this is,
I mean not that long ago either.

1627
01:34:16.510 --> 01:34:21.340
And then Lee Haney came after him,
right?
Was it Dorian Yates and then Lee Haney?

1628
01:34:21.341 --> 01:34:25.240
Is that what it was or am I getting it confused?
Leanne?
He's a black guy.
Yeah,

1629
01:34:25.241 --> 01:34:28.420
look at that picture right there.
Click on that.
Click on that one.
No,
no,
no.

1630
01:34:28.450 --> 01:34:32.560
The one that you just had up here,
click on that.
Click on that.

1631
01:34:32.590 --> 01:34:37.300
Look at the fucking size of him.
Dude.
Holy Christ.

1632
01:34:37.870 --> 01:34:41.830
There's a picture of him with his little speedos holding another guy with his

1633
01:34:41.831 --> 01:34:46.330
little speedos.
They're holding hands and,
and he is so fucking enormous.

1634
01:34:46.450 --> 01:34:47.980
This was when he was at his peak.

1635
01:34:48.010 --> 01:34:52.810
He was probably 300 fucking pounds of muscle in here.
Man.
That's ridiculous.

1636
01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:57.130
I wonder how much she actually would go there.
A picture of him.

1637
01:34:57.170 --> 01:34:59.550
But there's a picture of him today.
Look up Dorian Yates.
Today's prion.

1638
01:34:59.570 --> 01:35:02.900
Stop doing that.
Gained me out man.
He's bouncing,

1639
01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:06.680
bouncing them up and down their little bikinis on.
So Eddie,

1640
01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:09.860
I haven't had a chance to talk to you about a,
um,
this,
um,

1641
01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:14.690
this occupy Wall Street situation.
I'm going to take a piss because I have to.

1642
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:15.260
Okay.

1643
01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:18.560
So have a little chit chat with Brian for the next 30 seconds and we come back

1644
01:35:18.561 --> 01:35:20.540
and want to know what you feel about this operation.

1645
01:35:20.541 --> 01:35:24.800
Wall Street Occupy Wall Street.
Shit up.
You're okay?
Is this him today?
Right here?

1646
01:35:28.230 --> 01:35:29.070
<v 10>MMM.</v>

1647
01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:31.750
<v 2>Well no,
that can't be him today.</v>

1648
01:35:32.590 --> 01:35:33.423
<v 10>Okay,</v>

1649
01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:36.200
<v 2>that's crazy.
Imagine if you just looked down and saw that.</v>

1650
01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:43.700
That's crazy.
So how the comedy gone?
Uh,

1651
01:35:43.730 --> 01:35:47.120
I have been so busy,
I haven't been writing,
so you still go up,

1652
01:35:47.121 --> 01:35:49.500
but I go up and they every week,
twice a week,
something like that.

1653
01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:53.800
Just keep going up.
Yeah.
You know,
it's crazy because a practice,
you know,

1654
01:35:53.810 --> 01:35:58.790
Steve Reynolds easy,
he did a Spiderman joke and which is one of my bits,

1655
01:35:58.850 --> 01:36:02.900
uh,
almost like I'm talking about coming into a hotel room and throwing it on.

1656
01:36:02.930 --> 01:36:06.420
He said the window,
but I say the walls,
but a got Spiderman.

1657
01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:11.150
So it's so weird that as a comic he see that other side of where you write

1658
01:36:11.151 --> 01:36:15.470
something and then you're like,
oh yeah,
you know,
but did he,
it's weird at first.

1659
01:36:16.370 --> 01:36:20.810
Oh,
I did at first,
but I didn't create Spiderman.
Like as in throwing com.
Yeah,

1660
01:36:20.850 --> 01:36:24.070
that's,
I've heard Patricia Neal say it before.
Uh,

1661
01:36:24.110 --> 01:36:28.760
w what now I've seen it like I've,
I've just used it.
Yeah,
I think,
well,

1662
01:36:28.761 --> 01:36:29.361
when I was a kid,

1663
01:36:29.361 --> 01:36:31.970
I used to call it like all my friends would call it spider manning.

1664
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.030
So I don't think it was something like somebody just with,

1665
01:36:34.031 --> 01:36:37.630
like in 1997 I created Spiderman.
I think that's just like an old term or,

1666
01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:42.200
or maybe an old slang from the 80s.
Uh,
but yeah,

1667
01:36:42.201 --> 01:36:43.490
it's weird seeing that and it just,

1668
01:36:43.491 --> 01:36:47.000
it does make you just want to write more jokes and so it doesn't really matter,

1669
01:36:47.210 --> 01:36:51.020
but it's just weird seeing it.
Cause then anyone that saw that at that show,

1670
01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:55.310
I will know that joke already.
And then it sounds like I took it from the,

1671
01:36:55.311 --> 01:36:57.770
the show,
you know?
That's so weird.
What are you talking about?

1672
01:36:57.830 --> 01:37:02.360
I missed a Spiderman,
you know,
like that.
So they had a league the other day.

1673
01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:06.630
<v 1>Yeah.
And you know what?
Apparently uh,
Patrice O'Neil had been doing that before.</v>

1674
01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:10.110
<v 2>Yeah,
that's why I was just saying spirit of meeting is actually,
it's a term.</v>

1675
01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:12.000
Yeah.
So it's like saying a blowjob joke,

1676
01:37:12.001 --> 01:37:14.720
but the idea of doing it in a hotel room and throwing it on the wall,

1677
01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:17.730
it's kind of weird.
Well son,
sometimes you just gotta let Shit Go.

1678
01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:19.130
Have you had that happen?
Like,
just like,

1679
01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:21.750
like jokes being on TV and then you're like,

1680
01:37:21.751 --> 01:37:24.090
I don't feel like you've been doing that joke now because it feels like I'm

1681
01:37:24.091 --> 01:37:25.500
copying it off of the league.
Yeah.

1682
01:37:25.930 --> 01:37:29.890
<v 1>Yeah.
If you come to the same,
especially if it's a quick one liner,
right?</v>

1683
01:37:29.891 --> 01:37:34.720
Like an obvious one liner,
you know,
it's easily,
it's easy to,

1684
01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:38.790
for that to happen or,
and also,
you know,
for a lot of comics this,

1685
01:37:38.791 --> 01:37:42.460
this unfortunately it does happen where like writers of TV shows,

1686
01:37:42.461 --> 01:37:46.330
we'll go to see standups and they'll take a bit and I'll turn that bit into a TV

1687
01:37:46.331 --> 01:37:46.730
show.

1688
01:37:46.730 --> 01:37:47.100
<v 2>Yes.</v>

1689
01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:49.690
It seems like that happens a lot for like Sarah night live and shit like that.

1690
01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:50.990
I always,
your comics told them

1691
01:37:51.090 --> 01:37:53.960
<v 1>because people are desperate.
They're desperate.
They want to keep that job.</v>

1692
01:37:53.961 --> 01:37:55.470
And a lot of these writers,
same thing,

1693
01:37:55.471 --> 01:37:57.480
they're desperate and they want to keep their job.
Yeah.

1694
01:37:57.481 --> 01:37:59.450
I've had a couple of friends that got,
uh,
you know,

1695
01:37:59.550 --> 01:38:04.500
ripped off Kevin James was the funniest one.
Man.
Kenny,
Kevin James went to a,
um,

1696
01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:08.590
he had a big development deal with NBC and um,

1697
01:38:09.090 --> 01:38:12.850
when they have a big development deal,
they'll do shows and uh,

1698
01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:15.750
he'll do standup and for all these different writers and all these different

1699
01:38:15.751 --> 01:38:18.600
producers and they all tried to figure out what sort of a vehicle to develop

1700
01:38:18.601 --> 01:38:20.190
with them.
So,
uh,

1701
01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:24.270
he does his show and a year and a half later,

1702
01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:29.300
one of his bits is on Seinfeld and somebody,

1703
01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:33.300
I mean,
it's the fucking,
the taglines are the same.
I mean it was ridiculous.

1704
01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:37.110
Just kills the bit,
killed his bed.
He had,
he had a drop in the bed and you know,

1705
01:38:37.111 --> 01:38:38.970
I don't know that the guy saw him,

1706
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:44.000
but I don't think it's coincidental that here's this really hilarious comedian

1707
01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:47.730
who has this bit about muffins,
about Muffin tops,

1708
01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:49.160
like you only like the top of the mountain.

1709
01:38:49.161 --> 01:38:52.910
And he had this whole detailed bit about it.
I'd known Kevin for years by that I,

1710
01:38:52.911 --> 01:38:56.730
I'd see it was like one of his strongest bits and then all of a sudden he does

1711
01:38:56.731 --> 01:38:59.820
it on top of these guys in front of these guys.

1712
01:38:59.821 --> 01:39:02.010
And somebody tasting gangs had for a TV show.

1713
01:39:02.011 --> 01:39:05.060
I don't know if that actually happened for a fact,
but it certainly

1714
01:39:05.090 --> 01:39:07.410
<v 2>they seem like it happened.
Yeah,
it seems like it would be easy.</v>

1715
01:39:07.870 --> 01:39:10.500
<v 1>Yeah.
A lot of people probably guys gang I,</v>

1716
01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:14.600
there's guys ganking ideas and then there's just parallel Todd,

1717
01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:18.900
which happened parallel thinking.
It's constant.
It's common,
so common,
you know,

1718
01:39:18.901 --> 01:39:22.800
especially in this day and age,
you know,
with all,

1719
01:39:22.970 --> 01:39:25.670
we all have this sort of the same access to information,
you know,

1720
01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:30.300
with Google and with the Internet and Twitter and shed when we have way more

1721
01:39:30.301 --> 01:39:31.830
access to information than ever before.

1722
01:39:31.831 --> 01:39:36.270
So it's really for someone to come to a similar conclusion to you is even more

1723
01:39:36.271 --> 01:39:38.580
likely today,
I think than ever before.
Right.

1724
01:39:38.610 --> 01:39:42.360
<v 2>When you think,
well,
I mean in some ways,
but like with like with my instance,</v>

1725
01:39:42.361 --> 01:39:43.194
it's like all right,

1726
01:39:43.230 --> 01:39:47.280
just having a crazy term like spider manning and then coming and throwing your

1727
01:39:47.281 --> 01:39:49.500
calm like on a wall or stuff like that.

1728
01:39:49.530 --> 01:39:52.950
Which in on the League it was the window that seemed really though,
dude,

1729
01:39:52.951 --> 01:39:53.400
cause dude,

1730
01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:56.610
<v 1>it's a disgusting.
Okay.
And when dudes,</v>

1731
01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:00.700
you would think that flinging your loads like Spiderman and make that thing,

1732
01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:01.910
you think you're the first person?

1733
01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:05.160
<v 2>No,
no,
no.
I'm not saying that I'm the first person I think of that,
but I,</v>

1734
01:40:05.161 --> 01:40:09.000
the joke of being in a hotel room and just doing anything in a hotel room and

1735
01:40:09.001 --> 01:40:11.130
throwing it on the walls at Spiderman,
on the walls,

1736
01:40:11.370 --> 01:40:14.730
<v 1>white.
Honestly and I,
this is not meaning to be,</v>

1737
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:18.810
<v 2>I don't even care.
I'm just saying that the idea,
the problem is,
my joke is out.</v>

1738
01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:23.000
So I've heard a lot of comics talk about doing things in the hotel rose,

1739
01:40:23.001 --> 01:40:26.040
I'll ever heard a lot of comics talk about wrecking hotel rooms right now,

1740
01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:29.630
but doing Spiderman and on a hotel room and she seems kind of weird that they,

1741
01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:31.490
you know,
especially since,
uh,

1742
01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:34.480
<v 1>yeah,
I know what you're saying,
but it's,</v>

1743
01:40:34.810 --> 01:40:37.330
it's one of those things that could have,
they could have,
you know,

1744
01:40:37.490 --> 01:40:38.700
you never know.
They could have seen you do it

1745
01:40:38.850 --> 01:40:40.320
<v 2>or they could have heard you do it rather,</v>

1746
01:40:40.350 --> 01:40:42.540
or they could have just come up with it on their own.
Right.

1747
01:40:42.541 --> 01:40:43.920
Because you came up with it.
Right,
right.

1748
01:40:44.910 --> 01:40:48.180
It's all the idea of that in the hotel room.
Yeah.
That's disgusting.
Anyway,

1749
01:40:48.181 --> 01:40:51.140
and stop throwing your loads around you fucking free.
Maybe run a easy,

1750
01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:53.910
he's been hanging out with Carlson.
See Ya know

1751
01:40:54.050 --> 01:40:58.960
<v 5>Steve is good guy.
Steve [inaudible],
he's the best.
He's aces.
He's good people.</v>

1752
01:40:59.290 --> 01:41:02.480
And I saw him on that one shot.
I'm like,
Oh shit.
He's blowing up.
Yeah,

1753
01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:07.450
he is blind.
What does that show?
He's on legal.
Legal.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's a good dude.

1754
01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:11.470
Yeah.
You read as easy as the funny guy,
just old school comic store,

1755
01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:15.040
old school.
He was one of the guys on the clip.

1756
01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:18.370
That video clip of Mitzi was one of the few guys that stood up to him and see

1757
01:41:18.371 --> 01:41:21.100
her back then and told them,
you steal jokes.

1758
01:41:21.330 --> 01:41:26.140
I remember we used to go to the comedy store every Goddamn weekend.
Yeah,

1759
01:41:26.170 --> 01:41:30.730
pretty much every weekend we were at the comedy store for gears for years.
Shit.

1760
01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:35.300
Yeah.
I developed my whole act there the whole day.
I didn't realize my,

1761
01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:40.090
how hostile my act wasn't till I stopped performing there.
I didn't realize.

1762
01:41:40.330 --> 01:41:43.150
I brought my act to the Improv and I was like,
man,
why am I so angry?

1763
01:41:45.650 --> 01:41:49.780
It's like,
you know,
the comedy store,
it just makes you,
makes you more angry,
man.

1764
01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:52.710
That's a haunted spot.
A lot of angry people there.
You know,

1765
01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:57.170
we saw so much crazy shit on that street,
man.
So,
so much crazy shit.
I started,

1766
01:41:57.171 --> 01:41:58.690
dude getting knocked the fuck out.

1767
01:41:58.810 --> 01:42:02.530
There's nothing more terrifying than watching a guy involved in a street fight

1768
01:42:02.531 --> 01:42:03.041
where you know,

1769
01:42:03.041 --> 01:42:07.780
he has absolutely no idea how to defend himself because this poor guy,

1770
01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:10.700
they would not want to say poor guy cause you see them or kind of a Douche.

1771
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:11.291
Do remember that.

1772
01:42:11.291 --> 01:42:16.210
I remember that this guy was yelling at some other guy and we didn't see the

1773
01:42:16.211 --> 01:42:17.044
knockout.

1774
01:42:17.170 --> 01:42:22.150
We just saw him flailing like spastically.

1775
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:26.230
I remember he,
he didn't even have his hands clenched fist.

1776
01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:30.770
He was just swinging and like literally closing his eyes.
And then,
uh,

1777
01:42:30.850 --> 01:42:33.940
a bus moved in front of him and passed.

1778
01:42:34.030 --> 01:42:39.010
And then when we saw the space,
he was flat,
unconscious out cold.

1779
01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:43.960
So we don't know exactly what knocked him out.
But watching this poor guy,

1780
01:42:43.961 --> 01:42:47.530
like a deer in the headlights,
just flailing for his life.

1781
01:42:47.550 --> 01:42:50.410
It was really terrifying,
man.
You know,
I remember thinking,

1782
01:42:50.411 --> 01:42:53.800
watching this guy do that,
like holy Shit,
like this poor guy.

1783
01:42:53.980 --> 01:42:55.750
He doesn't know how to defend himself at all.

1784
01:42:55.751 --> 01:42:59.860
And somehow or another he's in a fight and he's just spasming.
He's just,

1785
01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:02.170
he wasn't even thinking about what he's trying to deal.

1786
01:43:02.290 --> 01:43:05.560
He was just closing his eyes and flailing his arms.
Yeah.

1787
01:43:05.740 --> 01:43:07.750
And somebody knocked him the fuck out.

1788
01:43:08.890 --> 01:43:11.700
How about when David Lee Roth came by and checked you out at the counter?

1789
01:43:11.701 --> 01:43:13.300
That was fun.
He liked,
loved you.

1790
01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:18.610
Nobody liked talking about the good old days.
More than David Lee Roth.

1791
01:43:18.611 --> 01:43:23.500
He has some great stories.
I love talking about the old days.
He loved it.

1792
01:43:23.501 --> 01:43:26.440
It was,
and I loved hearing it.
It was amazing stories of how,

1793
01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:30.280
how he managed all the groupies back in the day,

1794
01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:35.620
the greatest ideas.
This is what he did.
I don't think you're supposed to sell.

1795
01:43:35.710 --> 01:43:39.700
I don't think he wanted people to know this stuff now.
Yeah.
Because remember his,

1796
01:43:39.701 --> 01:43:40.090
uh,

1797
01:43:40.090 --> 01:43:44.950
he had a guy who got in contact with a red band after is over cause we had video

1798
01:43:44.951 --> 01:43:47.920
of this and he's like,
I just want to make sure that none of that video gets out.

1799
01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:52.790
Remember that?
It was a long time ago.
Yeah know it was,
but you know what?

1800
01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:53.930
Maybe it's David Lee Roth,

1801
01:43:53.931 --> 01:43:56.870
just a loose cannon and this dude is like his manager that takes for him.

1802
01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:58.430
I don't remember that.
I remember I just ran,

1803
01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:02.450
but I wouldn't want to disrespect him if that guy called.
It might be,

1804
01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:04.850
he might have called because of David Lee Roth.

1805
01:44:04.850 --> 01:44:06.260
So I don't want to tell any of his stories.

1806
01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:09.830
I'm pretty sure that was the case and I'm pretty sure,

1807
01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:14.840
I'm pretty sure David Lee Roth is a bad motherfucker.
Holy Shit.

1808
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:16.910
No one was more of a rock star than that guy.

1809
01:44:16.970 --> 01:44:20.030
And he entertained me and Eddie for shit.

1810
01:44:20.031 --> 01:44:23.630
He sat down and talked to us for over an hour telling just crazy stories on the

1811
01:44:23.631 --> 01:44:28.280
road and crazy stories are performing and it's,
you know,
it was awesome.

1812
01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:31.700
It was awesome.
That was one of the coolest like celebrity meetings ever.

1813
01:44:31.701 --> 01:44:34.340
He was so cool.
He was just hanging out,
man.

1814
01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:36.350
He just hanging out at the comedy store with his buddy.

1815
01:44:36.351 --> 01:44:38.300
They just came to watch some comedy and man,

1816
01:44:38.301 --> 01:44:41.280
when I tell you that wasn't even half full,
it wasn't even half folds.

1817
01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:42.380
A tiny ass little crowd.

1818
01:44:42.770 --> 01:44:43.100
<v 4>Right.</v>

1819
01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:47.780
There wasn't like a big place and he was just chilling and then he just hangs

1820
01:44:47.781 --> 01:44:52.250
out like a regular dude.
Man.
He had some great fucking stories of the old days,

1821
01:44:52.270 --> 01:44:56.570
man who would go on stage without bottle of Jack,
get out of hand.

1822
01:44:56.990 --> 01:45:01.010
That's it for me.
Shit.
It was so surreal because when I was in high school,

1823
01:45:01.140 --> 01:45:05.000
my my sister's boyfriend had van Halen was his license plate.

1824
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:06.830
They were dedicated to van Halen.

1825
01:45:07.070 --> 01:45:09.800
Everyone in my high school was like dedicated to van Halen.

1826
01:45:09.801 --> 01:45:11.550
My brother that was his favorite band,
like my,

1827
01:45:11.570 --> 01:45:15.730
my bandwidth kiss and his band was van Halen and he would,
you know,

1828
01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:16.551
we would like battle,

1829
01:45:16.551 --> 01:45:20.000
like who would come out the best on the One van Halen started fucking crushing

1830
01:45:20.001 --> 01:45:23.450
and getting just powerful kick started turning disco.
And I was like,

1831
01:45:23.451 --> 01:45:27.500
fuck man,
it's amazing how van Halen changed.

1832
01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:32.680
They went from being this like really fucking bad ass wild ban to jumping Hagar.

1833
01:45:36.230 --> 01:45:39.710
No,
Sammy Hagar,
man,
that's a different fucking van Halen.

1834
01:45:39.711 --> 01:45:41.480
A completely different sound.

1835
01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:45.380
Like it was totally and super successful.

1836
01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:48.110
Even more successful than the old van Halen.
Did you know that?

1837
01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:52.680
Probably by this figure was I think,
I think this that I think the Sammy van,

1838
01:45:53.190 --> 01:45:57.560
hey girl,
Hey Sammy Hagar van Halen,
that is more successful.
I don't know.

1839
01:45:57.561 --> 01:46:01.790
Maybe now over over time of year like you know Paul they talking about in my ass

1840
01:46:01.791 --> 01:46:03.890
but I think someone said that.
But,
um,

1841
01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:09.220
I think their fifth album was the last time with David Lee Roth is 1984 and when

1842
01:46:09.531 --> 01:46:14.360
that came out and jump was our first single and they shot that video for like

1843
01:46:14.361 --> 01:46:17.420
600 bucks.
I was the story and is like,
you know,
real low budget video.

1844
01:46:17.421 --> 01:46:21.860
But the whole song was just really,
really,

1845
01:46:22.250 --> 01:46:25.070
I mean I never liked that song jump.

1846
01:46:25.130 --> 01:46:30.130
It was like a keyboard som but really cheesy like Yamaha dx seven old school and

1847
01:46:31.611 --> 01:46:32.660
like what happened?

1848
01:46:32.810 --> 01:46:35.960
Like he just came on set because Eddie van Halen was a guitar.
God,

1849
01:46:35.961 --> 01:46:39.200
everybody worshiped him and here he comes out playing keyboards and that just

1850
01:46:39.201 --> 01:46:40.700
freaked everybody out.

1851
01:46:40.730 --> 01:46:45.350
We weren't ready for synth like that in the early eighties Brock bands weren't

1852
01:46:45.351 --> 01:46:48.680
doing that shit unless it was like evil.
Mr Crowley,
like Ozzy,

1853
01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:50.220
they weren't putting in.

1854
01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:55.110
<v 0>It was,
it was,
it took a big fucking chance and they blew the fuck up.
Yeah,</v>

1855
01:46:55.111 --> 01:46:58.080
that was a huge hit.
Massive.
And then Panama was huge.

1856
01:46:58.081 --> 01:47:02.680
I had Amal was the shit that was a good fucking song that was like hot for

1857
01:47:02.681 --> 01:47:06.260
teacher summer party song hot for a mature teacher.

1858
01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:07.710
So dude,

1859
01:47:07.770 --> 01:47:11.930
Panama was the summer party song and that was when I was in those aisles.

1860
01:47:11.980 --> 01:47:16.380
Like in high school?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Classic Shit.

1861
01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:21.030
Eddie van Halen shredded.
He changed the face of guitar plan.

1862
01:47:21.031 --> 01:47:23.580
He just by himself in his came out and just when he,

1863
01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:26.550
when the first album when he did that song eruption,

1864
01:47:26.551 --> 01:47:29.730
it's just a guitar solo is on the first album was the second song and they

1865
01:47:29.731 --> 01:47:33.630
opened up and running with the devil and then they just before you really got me

1866
01:47:33.631 --> 01:47:37.920
they just gave Eddie van Halen.
Just two minutes.
A second song.
He just shredding.

1867
01:47:37.921 --> 01:47:42.240
It's an all time classic eruption.
Could you have imagined?
It's fucking amazing.

1868
01:47:42.270 --> 01:47:46.050
Could you imagine of TMZ was around during David Lee Ross,

1869
01:47:47.370 --> 01:47:51.630
you imagine how many fucking videos they have had a ham hammered coming out of

1870
01:47:51.631 --> 01:47:54.630
clubs.
That would have been great shit that we missed.

1871
01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:58.640
That would have been classic fun stuff too.
Cause every time David Lee Roth,

1872
01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:01.570
you put a camera in front of his face and he knew what to say.
He would just,

1873
01:48:01.571 --> 01:48:03.990
you know,
smart.
He had like sayings,

1874
01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:08.490
you know how they say you got the last that I can do it a little bit.
You know,

1875
01:48:08.491 --> 01:48:12.090
he was more,
more,
more can I need to hear him?
If I heard them,
I could do it.

1876
01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:16.950
He had great quotes.
Yeah,
he was real good at that.
He was real good at like,
he,

1877
01:48:16.951 --> 01:48:21.250
I thought he was going to make it as a radio DJ when they had him replace Howard

1878
01:48:21.250 --> 01:48:24.090
Stern.
Howard stern went to a satellite.
I was like,
wow,

1879
01:48:24.091 --> 01:48:27.900
what a bold move fucking daily rob.
But then I thought about,
I was like,

1880
01:48:27.901 --> 01:48:31.110
he's such a bad mother fucker who wouldn't want to talk to him.
You know,

1881
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:31.980
let them go.

1882
01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:36.120
Like with David Lee Ross should do is just do a fucking podcast that that's what

1883
01:48:36.121 --> 01:48:40.350
he should do.
You know,
David Lee Roth podcast would be the shit.
Him and Joey,

1884
01:48:40.650 --> 01:48:43.020
dude,
are you kidding me?
Jelly.

1885
01:48:43.740 --> 01:48:47.580
Do the David Lee Roth should have an awesome fucking podcast.

1886
01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:52.620
You know he's a fun dude to talk to man.
Sign them red band.

1887
01:48:53.490 --> 01:48:56.790
No,
I don't think he does.
You check on Itunes,
the David Lee Roth podcast.

1888
01:48:56.820 --> 01:48:59.460
People come to you for podcast now and then you're like,

1889

Master the pod.

1890
01:49:03.151 --> 01:49:06.600
Father I hit.
Do you have to turn people down?
Plug best?

1891
01:49:06.970 --> 01:49:10.800
I do really well.
I'm the only one doing everything,

1892
01:49:10.801 --> 01:49:14.910
so it's really hard.
Oh,
he's blown the fuck ups on.
That's just how it is.

1893
01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:19.560

Joey Diaz,

01:49:59.230 --> 01:50:00.390
We can't talk about that.

1907
01:50:00.990 --> 01:50:04.930
That was a great story to remind me to tell because I don't remember all the

1908
01:50:04.931 --> 01:50:09.220
details.
You can't tell without his permission.
He didn't want to ruin me pants.

1909
01:50:10.670 --> 01:50:12.730
It's about the fucking thinks he can invest with me.

1912

He got make it.

1913
01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:31.630
This guy is insane.
Did you guys call the psychiatric ward?

1914
01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:35.740
Well,
I took off my pants first.
Wait a minute.

1915
01:50:36.330 --> 01:50:40.180
I didn't want to ruin my pants and underwear on and then he took off his pants

1916
01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:45.130
and underwear and he fucking pulled God on me mate.
I got like,

1917
01:50:45.190 --> 01:50:49.090

1918
01:50:50.100 --> 01:50:52.650
The guy's like,

You think you're taking your pants off.

1919
01:50:52.710 --> 01:50:55.060
We'll check this out.
Get motherfucker.
Huh?

1920
01:50:55.130 --> 01:50:57.920
<v 1>Maybe it could be that.
So I think it was just showing him off.</v>

1921
01:50:58.100 --> 01:50:59.540
Maybe some gay shit though too.

1922
01:50:59.570 --> 01:51:02.750
We can't discount the possibility of gay and that scenario.

1923
01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:05.570
You know that seems like your guy was just hoping everything would go right.

1924
01:51:05.690 --> 01:51:07.760
And then he started crying.
Come on.

1925
01:51:07.850 --> 01:51:11.220
<v 3>Which isn't like the mean streets of in an alley somewhere.
Was this</v>

1926
01:51:11.570 --> 01:51:12.650
<v 1>a hotel room?
Oh,</v>

1927
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:20.830
imagine if there was a clock somewhere that has accidental gay acts had showed

1928
01:51:21.021 --> 01:51:24.440
the number like the national debt and you can just see all the accidental gate

1929
01:51:24.620 --> 01:51:27.080
gay acts all day.
Dink,
dink,
dink,
dink.

1930
01:51:27.081 --> 01:51:31.580
Look Brian Collins story and any accidental gas.
Just a clock.

1931
01:51:32.180 --> 01:51:34.190
The universe recognizes when someone fuck.

1932
01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:38.290
<v 3>Oh Jesus.
Oh what have you done?
That's a guy you got to get Brian Calendar.</v>

1933
01:51:38.310 --> 01:51:41.610
Do his personal mean again cause he was the original Brazilian master.
You know

1934
01:51:41.730 --> 01:51:46.620
<v 1>Brian Callan is ah,
is the original.
He does a perfect Henzel Gracie Brazil.</v>

1935
01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:49.080
That's what he does.
He like talks like Kenzo.

1936
01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:53.760
<v 3>Yeah.
Maybe you could pull that.
Pull ups.
Look,
pull up.
Ah,
not my car.</v>

1937
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:57.620
I don't think it's on there.
It's on youtube.
It's on youtube.
Jay Instructor.

1938
01:51:57.630 --> 01:52:01.740
Gay Porn.
Yeah,
something like that.
This is old school.

1939
01:52:01.770 --> 01:52:06.060
This is before you were,
we were at the UFC work bankruptcy before cause yeah,

1940
01:52:06.090 --> 01:52:09.450
when super first bought the UFC we were like,
Holy Shit,

1941
01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:12.180
you are the only celebrity that liked it.
So they gave you great seats.

1942
01:52:12.420 --> 01:52:14.160
So the first like three or four UFC,

1943
01:52:14.250 --> 01:52:17.490
we were sitting ringside enjoying it and they'd come up to you and get like a

1944
01:52:17.491 --> 01:52:19.140
quota.
Oh wait,
we're sitting here with Joe Rogan.

1945
01:52:19.141 --> 01:52:21.450
What do you think about the fights?
And then you would say something cool.

1946
01:52:21.570 --> 01:52:25.770
I think it's like human chess,
but instead,
you know something cool.

1947
01:52:25.771 --> 01:52:28.290
And then they would use that soundbite in commercials.

1948
01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:31.370
And then everyone loved the soup every,
you always had a great soundbite,

1949
01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:36.390
you know,
great analogy about the sport.
If boxing is this,
this is the,
you know,

1950
01:52:36.660 --> 01:52:40.360
and then gain.
I said,
dude,
you want to do some commentary?
And you're like,
yeah,

1951
01:52:40.361 --> 01:52:44.500
and you did commentary.
And I'm like sitting there by myself forever.

1952
01:52:45.670 --> 01:52:46.010
Yeah.

1953
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:49.910
<v 0>All this problem.
That became a problem.
So you,
you were like,
damn,</v>

1954
01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:52.350
it sucks working by myself.
Maybe I could get you a job.

1955
01:52:55.780 --> 01:52:58.190
I don't see that video on line.
If you look right here to the right,

1956
01:52:58.191 --> 01:53:02.210
this is what comes up.
Bjj Instructor,
Gay Porn,
Cowen.
No,

1957
01:53:02.211 --> 01:53:05.540
don't put countdown put and it's right there.
It's right that right.

1958
01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:08.990
There's another one on top of it.
No,
the one.
That one right there.
Yeah,
that's it.

1959
01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:11.570
That's it.
That's it.
Check this out.
Old School.

1960
01:53:11.571 --> 01:53:16.400
Brian Cowen before UFC at the MGM and this is,

1961
01:53:16.401 --> 01:53:20.460
it's like,
it's in a little tiny video.
I just take a guy sometimes

1962
01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:22.590
<v 6>wouldn't do my man.
I may</v>

1963
01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:26.970
want to talk to him like that.

1964
01:53:26.971 --> 01:53:30.480
Deep my hand now.

1965
01:53:53.570 --> 01:53:58.570
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1966
01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:09.240
Oh my God.
Can you split the call on the moon?

1967
01:54:09.250 --> 01:54:13.760
You have the sex times.
Guys don't understand for me.
Might go,

1968
01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:18.800
what I'm going to do now [inaudible] I can't get,

1969
01:54:24.900 --> 01:54:26.860
want to do barn or something.

1970
01:54:30.060 --> 01:54:34.380
Get my pool's.
Nah Man.
Get my book

1971
01:54:41.070 --> 01:54:45.900
making fucking moves in the air with
[inaudible].

1972
01:54:52.630 --> 01:54:52.900
Oh

1973
01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:57.370
<v 0>my God.
That was one of the,
until Joey Diaz was on the Alex Jones show.</v>

1974
01:54:57.400 --> 01:55:00.520
That was the funniest thing I'd ever seen.
It's true.

1975
01:55:00.820 --> 01:55:03.610
That was the funniest thing I'd ever seen in my life until Joe,

1976
01:55:03.611 --> 01:55:07.530
when Joey Diaz is on the Alex Jones show that just,
it was a,
that was done.

1977
01:55:07.540 --> 01:55:10.480
We see that or have you already played?
We played that at times,

1978
01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:15.250
but it's iTunes listeners are going to hate this episode.
Yeah,
we're sorry.

1979
01:55:15.251 --> 01:55:16.480
We're showing a lot of things and,

1980
01:55:16.650 --> 01:55:19.720
well we originally was supposed to be Joey and Eddie and I and we're going to do

1981
01:55:19.721 --> 01:55:23.440
regular,
uh,
and it's not all MMA,
but we're going to talk about that,

1982
01:55:23.441 --> 01:55:28.441
but may because it's the one request that we get all the time is doing MMA only

1983
01:55:28.961 --> 01:55:29.740
podcast.

1984
01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:33.780
So what we decided to do is try to make this one as much MMA as possible.
Uh,

1985
01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:36.580
and some of that,
unfortunately it's like visual.
Yeah.

1986
01:55:36.581 --> 01:55:39.370
Mason and maybe that shouldn't be a Joe Rogan experience.

1987
01:55:39.670 --> 01:55:43.950
Maybe that'll be like something else.
Um,
maybe because you don't want to

1988
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:45.450
<v 5>be listening to it,
like driving around,</v>

1989
01:55:45.451 --> 01:55:49.530
listening to Sirius radio and going like what they were watching a video for a

1990
01:55:49.530 --> 01:55:52.170
half hour.
Yeah.
That's not a bad idea.

1991
01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:55.380
We maybe should have thought about that a moment that'll motivate them to go

1992
01:55:55.381 --> 01:56:00.020
watch the video.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
But yeah,
but that's also fine with,

1993
01:56:00.090 --> 01:56:00.390
yeah.

1994
01:56:00.390 --> 01:56:04.950
Well I think that might've been a boring 10 minutes for people that don't know

1995
01:56:04.951 --> 01:56:07.410
the history of it,
you know,
for us as we'll see.

1996
01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:12.110
We'll see what rolls out memory lane.
So I wanted to ask you about,
um,

1997
01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:13.680
this before I went to take a leak.

1998
01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:16.680
I want to ask you what the fuck you think about this occupy Wall Street shit.

1999
01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:18.840
What,
what,
what is your take on all this?

2000
01:56:21.250 --> 01:56:24.910
<v 4>You're not,
to be honest,
I haven't really looked that deeply into it.</v>

2001
01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:29.680
It just seems,
I don't know.
I mean,
it's definitely good,
right?

2002
01:56:29.790 --> 01:56:34.790
Anytime there's the people unite and try to change things,

2003
01:56:35.351 --> 01:56:39.190
that's always good.
Right.
You know,
but I don't know.
Well,

2004
01:56:39.191 --> 01:56:42.700
one of the reasons why I asked him,
because Europe,
I mean I've

2005
01:56:43.510 --> 01:56:48.510
<v 1>never in my whole life had more conversations about 2012 Zacharias Cichon Beuru</v>

2006
01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:54.820
Annunaki you and I have had more of these conversations at anybody and you and I

2007
01:56:54.821 --> 01:56:59.320
have had several of these Mayan calendar conversations and the end of the world

2008
01:56:59.321 --> 01:57:00.131
conversations,

2009
01:57:00.131 --> 01:57:05.131
and I hate to be like the guy who says it's all falling apart,

2010
01:57:05.501 --> 01:57:08.890
man.
It's all falling apart,
man.
Yeah.
But if you look at it,

2011
01:57:09.130 --> 01:57:12.580
it's all falling apart,
man.
It's like how far can it fall?

2012
01:57:12.970 --> 01:57:17.050
Is there a safety net in there somewhere?
What do you mean we go bankrupt?

2013
01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:20.830
What happens when we go bankrupt?
I don't get it.
I'm missing something here,
man.

2014
01:57:21.110 --> 01:57:23.710
I don't know.
Is are the resources and the amount of people,

2015
01:57:23.711 --> 01:57:26.740
are those numbers vastly different than they were just a few years ago?
No,

2016
01:57:26.741 --> 01:57:28.960
they're not.
So what the fuck do we have to do to,

2017
01:57:28.990 --> 01:57:32.430
to re pump up the system to get it to the,
where it,
where it,

2018
01:57:32.431 --> 01:57:35.530
where it functions again or is it not possible?

2019
01:57:35.650 --> 01:57:39.250
Is it that in order for the system to function overall,

2020
01:57:39.310 --> 01:57:43.480
some places have to be bad in some places have to be good.
Is that,
is that,

2021
01:57:43.481 --> 01:57:46.420
is that the case?
I mean is it,
is it that,
no,

2022
01:57:46.510 --> 01:57:51.510
we can't like be even all across the country and therefore the American way of

2023
01:57:51.641 --> 01:57:56.290
life can't be sustained because the American way of life is only possible if

2024
01:57:56.291 --> 01:58:00.520
people in other parts of the world have to work for shit money and make the

2025
01:58:00.521 --> 01:58:02.830
products that we absorb.
Right.

2026
01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:05.940
<v 4>It seems like you put it all together.</v>

2027
01:58:05.941 --> 01:58:10.941
It seems like the powers that be Hollen asked to siphon as much money as they

2028
01:58:13.051 --> 01:58:13.920
can.
For some,

2029
01:58:13.921 --> 01:58:17.970
it doesn't seem that with like all this money just being taken and trillions of

2030
01:58:17.970 --> 01:58:20.220
dollars are going missing from the Pentagon,

2031
01:58:20.430 --> 01:58:25.430
like two point $3 trillion disappears and that was on the Jesse Rune Tierra puts

2032
01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:28.720
furry,
furry,
no,
that,
that was in that,

2033
01:58:28.750 --> 01:58:32.670
but it's really like Donald Rumsfeld the day before nine one one they said,

2034
01:58:32.671 --> 01:58:35.070
you know,
we have a big problem.
The enemies here,
enemies here,

2035
01:58:35.540 --> 01:58:39.240
and then the next that he announces that there's two point 3 trillion.

2036
01:58:39.270 --> 01:58:40.380
I think all of those are the numbers.

2037
01:58:40.381 --> 01:58:45.100
It's like 2.3 or 3.1 some kind of trillions and he announces this the day
before,

2038
01:58:45.101 --> 01:58:47.000
nine one one and he's going to do something about it.

2039
01:58:47.001 --> 01:58:48.430
You're going to look into the Pentagon,

2040
01:58:48.460 --> 01:58:51.700
they're going to look into the accounting and all that shit.
The day before,

2041
01:58:51.701 --> 01:58:56.701
nine one one and it was just stealing trillions unaccounted for.

2042
01:58:56.741 --> 01:58:59.470
They go,
we don't know where these two point $3 trillion.

2043
01:58:59.620 --> 01:59:01.890
It just seems like they're just going out of the way.

2044
01:59:02.050 --> 01:59:02.201
<v 1>Well,</v>

2045
01:59:02.201 --> 01:59:05.580
how about the most recent one where they said there was billions of dollars of

2046
01:59:05.581 --> 01:59:08.170
missing in Iraq and then they go,
oh no,

2047
01:59:08.350 --> 01:59:12.600
actually we found it and the Iraqis were kind enough to watch over it.

2048
01:59:12.610 --> 01:59:17.320
Guarded for us.
Yeah,
the fuck you did the fuck you did.
Fuck.

2049
01:59:17.321 --> 01:59:18.850
You found that at sound?

2050
01:59:18.851 --> 01:59:22.410
Some billions of dollars just laying around what they would just garden.

2051
01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:24.910
You didn't know where it was and they just had it in a room somewhere for you.

2052
01:59:25.090 --> 01:59:26.200
Oh,
we're just waiting for you to ask.

2053
01:59:26.300 --> 01:59:27.990
<v 4>Rumsfeld announces on,</v>

2054
01:59:28.010 --> 01:59:33.010
on on September 10th and then the next day the accounting office blows up and

2055
01:59:35.631 --> 01:59:39.050
the pedagogy,
some say it was a plane,
some say it was a missile,

2056
01:59:39.260 --> 01:59:42.890
whatever the heck the next day all the records are gone.

2057
01:59:43.580 --> 01:59:45.110
I mean it just seems like,

2058
01:59:45.190 --> 01:59:46.030
<v 1>I'll tell you what man,</v>

2059
01:59:46.031 --> 01:59:51.031
that nine 11 there's never a better case for confirmation bias then that nine 11

2060
01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:54.250
September 11 you know,

2061
01:59:54.251 --> 01:59:57.700
confirmation biases when you only look at one side of the argument because

2062
01:59:57.701 --> 01:59:59.350
you're trying to convince yourself that you're right.

2063
02:00:00.310 --> 02:00:03.610
And in the September 11th one man,
that's one where people just,

2064
02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:08.820
no one wants to admit that even the possibility that the government somehow knew

2065
02:00:10.361 --> 02:00:15.010
about it or somehow was involved in organizing and no one would ever,

2066
02:00:15.011 --> 02:00:19.300
ever,
ever,
ever admit that.
And if you admit that like you're a piece of shit.

2067
02:00:19.390 --> 02:00:21.970
Yeah.
You know,
that's,
it's a real tricky thing.

2068
02:00:21.971 --> 02:00:23.950
Like they don't want to look at the facts of the past.

2069
02:00:23.951 --> 02:00:27.340
They don't want to look at things like operation Northwoods or the Bay of Pigs

2070
02:00:27.341 --> 02:00:31.300
are all the different times where it might have been a bunch of bullshit while

2071
02:00:31.301 --> 02:00:34.840
we were in some country and one while young people were getting killed for
their,

2072
02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:35.830
their crazy bidding.

2073
02:00:35.831 --> 02:00:39.580
That might've been bullshit that we would have never agreed to if we knew what

2074
02:00:39.581 --> 02:00:43.120
the fuck was really going on.
Yeah.
But for whatever reason,
you know,

2075
02:00:43.121 --> 02:00:45.850
people don't want to look at that.
They don't want to look at that possibility.

2076
02:00:45.950 --> 02:00:46.701
<v 4>It's incredible.</v>

2077
02:00:46.701 --> 02:00:51.140
The amount of evidence there is that there nine one one was super shady.

2078
02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:55.820
I mean the fact that most people don't even know three sky sky scrapers went

2079
02:00:55.821 --> 02:00:58.550
down on nine 11.
Most people they'll tell you to,

2080
02:00:58.580 --> 02:01:02.360
you ask them how many skyscrapers went down.
Three went down.

2081
02:01:02.540 --> 02:01:04.490
They just don't talk about tower seven.

2082
02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:07.700
That was a like a 50 storey skyscraper.

2083
02:01:07.790 --> 02:01:10.970
They just imploded like a controlled demo.

2084
02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:14.180
You could look at it and it looks like a criminal controlled demo.

2085
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:18.410
You'll look at it,
you see it,
it's on video.
Bunch of different angles.

2086
02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:22.340
And they didn't talk about it in the,
the,
the initial nine one,

2087
02:01:22.341 --> 02:01:23.210
one commission report.

2088
02:01:23.211 --> 02:01:27.320
They didn't even talk about why this skyscraper went down after years of

2089
02:01:27.321 --> 02:01:31.970
pressure and people go,
what the fuck happened to tower seven?

2090
02:01:31.971 --> 02:01:36.170
Why did it look like,
why was it demo to go?
It fell at free fall speed.

2091
02:01:36.171 --> 02:01:40.130
Everyone kept saying it fall that feel free.
Fall speed.
Explain.
People wanted

2092
02:01:40.190 --> 02:01:44.330
<v 3>after.
So finally the government hired,
uh,</v>

2093
02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:47.970
I think they're called [inaudible].
Um,
[inaudible].

2094
02:01:48.380 --> 02:01:52.540
It's like initials for some scientific company that's funded by the government,

2095
02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:54.410
NIST,
NIST and I.
S.

2096
02:01:54.411 --> 02:01:56.840
T you could see the videos on youtube unless they've been pulled.

2097
02:01:57.260 --> 02:02:02.260
And there they had a press conference and to explain what happened to this 50

2098
02:02:04.191 --> 02:02:08.720
story or it's like 47 storey skyscraper that just on video got controlled

2099
02:02:08.721 --> 02:02:12.290
Daimler ago.
It fell at free fall speed and they're staying there.

2100
02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:17.330
So they came up and to prove that it wasn't free fall speed,

2101
02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:20.780
that if it was free fall speed that it would,
it would've,

2102
02:02:20.860 --> 02:02:24.350
it would've fell in 4.2 seconds instead of,
you know,

2103
02:02:24.351 --> 02:02:28.370
4.4 seconds or some ridiculous thing like that.
Like there were a second off.

2104
02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:31.370
So there was just there to prove that it wasn't free fall speed.

2105
02:02:31.371 --> 02:02:34.610
So therefore there's no conspiracy.
So they go,
so wait a minute,
what,

2106
02:02:34.611 --> 02:02:38.420
so do any controlled demo,
any controlled demos,
do they fall at free fall speed?

2107
02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:41.120
None of that got the definition of free fall speed is something,

2108
02:02:41.150 --> 02:02:44.060
this is what they say,
something falling without any resistance.

2109
02:02:44.090 --> 02:02:44.990
That's free fall speed.

2110
02:02:45.140 --> 02:02:48.050
So this building had resistance so it's not free fall speed.

2111
02:02:48.140 --> 02:02:50.840
So they call the wait a minute.
Ridiculous.
Ridiculous.
It wasn't ridiculous.

2112
02:02:50.841 --> 02:02:53.930
There's mass.
Yeah,
of course.
Do some boots that stood up and said,

2113
02:02:54.770 --> 02:02:56.690
so wait a minute,
so do control demos.

2114
02:02:56.691 --> 02:02:59.090
Would you consider that freefall speed's other?
And they go,
nope,

2115
02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:02.750
that's not free fall speed.
Oh feel controlled demos are not free fall speed.

2116
02:03:02.990 --> 02:03:05.180
So why are we talking about this?
Yeah,
what is that?

2117
02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:07.930
It was ridiculous and you would just tell they just had it

2118
02:03:08.260 --> 02:03:08.890
<v 5>her job.</v>

2119
02:03:08.890 --> 02:03:12.130
That's fascinating that nobody thought anybody was going to counter that and

2120
02:03:12.170 --> 02:03:15.070
asked them if controlled demolitions or free fall speed.
Yeah.

2121
02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:18.190
I don't know if that was a controlled demolition because obviously I'm not an

2122
02:03:18.191 --> 02:03:21.070
architect to nor do I know anything about building structure.

2123
02:03:21.310 --> 02:03:26.260
So it is possible that you know you could burn a building and the fire reaches

2124
02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:31.320
so high and it's so hot that all the floors collapse uniformly and it pancakes

2125
02:03:31.361 --> 02:03:34.750
into itself.
It is possible.
I don't know,
based on you know,

2126
02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:38.380
architects and engineers for to live in truth,
they don't think it's possible.

2127
02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:42.640
Yeah.
That's 1300 just common sense.
Just common sense.

2128
02:03:42.641 --> 02:03:46.750
This is a video of a controlled demo and no other buildings you just put like,

2129
02:03:46.840 --> 02:03:50.230
like a detective.
No building has ever fallen like that ever before.

2130
02:03:50.290 --> 02:03:52.720
Do you think they armed the building when they built it?

2131
02:03:52.930 --> 02:03:54.760
What do you think they did if you thought,

2132
02:03:54.761 --> 02:03:57.310
if you think that's a controlled demolition,
what do you think they did?

2133
02:03:57.311 --> 02:03:59.650
Did they and it'd be I man everybody like there's a lot of people right now

2134
02:03:59.651 --> 02:04:02.050
getting angry.
It's a fucking bullshit conversation.

2135
02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:05.260
You fucking conspiracy theorists.
Listen,
I don't know.

2136
02:04:05.261 --> 02:04:08.800
I'm not saying I literally have no opinion on it,
but when I look at it,

2137
02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:12.190
it does look like a controlled demolition.
Does that mean anything?
No,

2138
02:04:12.191 --> 02:04:13.060
because I'm an idiot.

2139
02:04:13.130 --> 02:04:17.320
I'm not some sort of an engineer or any sort of a scientist.
However,

2140
02:04:17.321 --> 02:04:20.350
why does everybody get mad when you say it looks like a controlled demolition?

2141
02:04:20.500 --> 02:04:23.620
Yeah,
cause it fucking does.
Yeah,
that's true.
Fucking does.
Why are they mad?

2142
02:04:23.830 --> 02:04:25.120
Why you mad when I say that?

2143
02:04:25.121 --> 02:04:29.110
Someone that goes to the kinks in the middle and then falls into its own base

2144
02:04:29.260 --> 02:04:32.320
instantly.
Instantly.
All at what it does,
it all crumbles.

2145
02:04:32.321 --> 02:04:34.840
Everything gives out at the exact same order.

2146
02:04:35.020 --> 02:04:38.130
Like it just like it wasn't a controlled demolition and all gave out Florida

2147
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:41.670
<v 1>floors.
Perfect.
It looks exactly like a control down fell into its base.</v>

2148
02:04:41.730 --> 02:04:44.550
No other one's saying it's a controlled demolition.
I don't know.

2149
02:04:44.551 --> 02:04:46.530
It's a controlled demolition.
You don't know.
Right.

2150
02:04:46.610 --> 02:04:49.740
It's like it looks like one minute look like one,
right?
It does.
Right.

2151
02:04:49.810 --> 02:04:52.080
But why does everybody get mad when you say it looks like a controlled

2152
02:04:52.081 --> 02:04:54.750
demolition?
Just look at it,
look at controlled demos.

2153
02:04:54.751 --> 02:04:55.950
There's plenty of video on them.

2154
02:04:55.951 --> 02:04:58.830
And then look at tower seven it's all on youtube.
You could just watch it.

2155
02:04:59.010 --> 02:05:03.660
No skyscraper ever has fallen like,
like that from fires.

2156
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:07.440
It could be that,
you know,
if it gets damaged the way that got damaged.

2157
02:05:07.441 --> 02:05:08.950
And apparently that was also the,

2158
02:05:08.951 --> 02:05:12.570
the house diesel fueled there and there's like some sort of a lawsuit because of

2159
02:05:12.571 --> 02:05:15.930
that.
So they're saying like the diesel fuel led to,
you know,

2160
02:05:15.931 --> 02:05:18.540
the fire being so hot that everything collapsed like that.

2161
02:05:18.850 --> 02:05:22.350
It possible still it looks like a controlled demolition.
You don't believe that.

2162
02:05:22.351 --> 02:05:24.210
But it could be.
But what minimum you see.

2163
02:05:24.211 --> 02:05:27.420
But if they did really have like who knows how many gallons a fucking diesel

2164
02:05:27.421 --> 02:05:31.080
fuel,
you know,
thousands of millions,
who knows and that stuff is on fire.

2165
02:05:31.260 --> 02:05:33.270
That's an incredible amount of heat that would be generated.

2166
02:05:33.271 --> 02:05:36.270
That does make sense that it could compromise the structural integrity of a

2167
02:05:36.271 --> 02:05:38.970
building of,
it's all a bit of it's base becomes an oven.

2168
02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:42.840
If I had a bet $1 million either when we were going to find out the answer and

2169
02:05:42.841 --> 02:05:45.660
you have to guess,
I would definitely go,
okay,
this is,

2170
02:05:46.020 --> 02:05:48.330
I would say controlled demolition,
controlled demolition.

2171
02:05:48.331 --> 02:05:49.550
There's a lot of shady shit going.

2172
02:05:49.620 --> 02:05:51.950
Here's where it gets really crazy in the war started after that.

2173
02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:54.660
It was a way to get into the wards.
So here's where it gets really crazy.

2174
02:05:54.720 --> 02:05:58.410
That was that building was where the NSA had offices.

2175
02:05:58.411 --> 02:06:03.411
The CIA had offices did tower tower ellogence had all kinds of like secret

2176
02:06:04.591 --> 02:06:09.210
fucking black ops shit going on in there.
You know what?

2177
02:06:09.240 --> 02:06:10.770
Let me tell you a little story.
Let me tell you.

2178
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:15.030
Choose Joe if you're doing the same yes or no question that he did.
You know,

2179
02:06:15.031 --> 02:06:17.430
like we're going to find the answer out right now.
What do you mean?

2180
02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:20.770
If it was a controlled demolition,
what would I do?
What do you mean?

2181
02:06:20.780 --> 02:06:23.880
What would she choose?
Oh,
if I had to say one,
one or the other,

2182
02:06:23.910 --> 02:06:26.370
whether it was or not.
That's a good question.
Um,

2183
02:06:29.220 --> 02:06:32.620
it looks like a controlled demolition.
You know,
I don't,
it doesn't make sense.

2184
02:06:32.850 --> 02:06:37.560
This is one $9 trillion dollars.
1 million for me,
10 billion for him

2185
02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:43.920
and Billy,
and it's fucking really hard to guess,
man.

2186
02:06:43.980 --> 02:06:47.800
It'd be really hard to guess because honestly it sounds preposterous and this is

2187
02:06:47.801 --> 02:06:50.490
this my la,
you know,
outcomes,
razor logic,
all that stuff.

2188
02:06:50.730 --> 02:06:55.080
When I think the fact that they might have hired a whole crew to rig this

2189
02:06:55.081 --> 02:07:00.081
building with explosives or maybe construct the building with explosives built

2190
02:07:00.121 --> 02:07:00.871
in,
like,

2191
02:07:00.871 --> 02:07:05.871
does anybody do that or is it possible that this fucking two planes slammed into

2192
02:07:06.901 --> 02:07:10.950
these giant towers caused all this fucking damage to neighboring buildings and

2193
02:07:10.951 --> 02:07:14.520
it started a fire and the fire lit up these gasoline drums that were filled with

2194
02:07:14.521 --> 02:07:19.020
diesel fuel and there's millions of gallons of fuel in the whole thing inside of

2195
02:07:19.021 --> 02:07:22.950
it became like a fucking oven and just gave out all at once.
Shit,

2196
02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:27.360
I got to go with,
got 10 seconds,
Joe.
I got to go with controlled demolition.
Yeah.

2197
02:07:27.361 --> 02:07:32.010
Fuck yeah,
you'd go a controlled demolition.
If I had to one way or the other,

2198
02:07:32.011 --> 02:07:36.070
I absolutely don't know.
But if I,
if I would be surprised if

2199
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:39.250
<v 0>it was proven that it was a controlled demolition.
Sorry,
you both lost guys.</v>

2200
02:07:39.910 --> 02:07:42.950
The true answer was two planes just crashed in there and there was a lot of fuel

2201
02:07:42.951 --> 02:07:45.870
in that building and everyone's Jason,
you know,

2202
02:07:45.950 --> 02:07:50.140
that's a true fact though.
It is.
It's just true.
It's just true.

2203
02:07:50.170 --> 02:07:53.830
You'd be surprised that not only do most regular people right here and awesome

2204
02:07:53.831 --> 02:07:58.200
argue or know about tower seven.
Check this out.

2205
02:07:58.320 --> 02:08:02.310
<v 4>I'm at grapplers quest right now.
One of the refs,
um,</v>

2206
02:08:03.120 --> 02:08:05.910
after in the middle of the show we,
we uh,

2207
02:08:06.660 --> 02:08:09.510
we started talking about,
I don't know how it came up,

2208
02:08:09.511 --> 02:08:13.150
but he said he used to work for the FBI and then he got out of that Shit and

2209
02:08:13.151 --> 02:08:15.570
then you started working with Brian Simmons and with a grappler,

2210
02:08:15.571 --> 02:08:18.180
squats and all that stuff.
And I go,
so what do you think about,

2211
02:08:18.330 --> 02:08:22.350
he started telling me how that went.
You know,
he had like shit jobs.

2212
02:08:22.351 --> 02:08:25.500
I guess FBI is not glamorous dude.
When nine one one happened,

2213
02:08:25.501 --> 02:08:30.360
guess what I had at bucket duty?
I had me at ground zero,
just putting shit.

2214
02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:32.940
I was doing nothing.
That was no investigative work.

2215
02:08:32.970 --> 02:08:36.030
We were just all out there just picking up trash.
Man is like,

2216
02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:38.010
he's like talking about FBI being,

2217
02:08:38.020 --> 02:08:43.020
imagine how much time it took to clean up 200 story skyscrapers,

2218
02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:47.460
garbage dude.
I would have taken like 100,000 Mexicans.

2219
02:08:47.580 --> 02:08:49.830
They would have finished that shit.
I got month,
but anyways,

2220
02:08:50.130 --> 02:08:52.420
<v 0>go there and he's allowed to say he's allowed to scan,</v>

2221
02:08:52.430 --> 02:08:53.990
let's take advantage of that Mexican

2222
02:08:54.490 --> 02:08:57.530
<v 4>liberal with that.
But uh,
he was telling me this like fog.</v>

2223
02:08:57.550 --> 02:09:01.120
It was like we were on bucket patrol.
FBI's so not glamorous.

2224
02:09:01.121 --> 02:09:03.490
It's not like it is in the movies brought trust me and I go,

2225
02:09:03.491 --> 02:09:07.000
so what do you think about tower seven,
man?
What do you think?
And he goes,

2226
02:09:07.540 --> 02:09:11.770
what do you mean tower seven?
I go,
I go,
you don't,
you know that tower seven,

2227
02:09:11.771 --> 02:09:14.260
there was a third tower that went down and didn't get hit by a plane,

2228
02:09:14.530 --> 02:09:17.240
is a third one that went down.
You know,
I said,
you know,

2229
02:09:17.380 --> 02:09:22.240
the CIA had offices in their navy,
intelligent and Ron,
all that.
And he goes,
Oh

2230
02:09:23.950 --> 02:09:24.610
man,

2231
02:09:24.610 --> 02:09:29.380
you know what their problem is getting rid of a lot of evidence.
Miss.

2232
02:09:29.410 --> 02:09:31.990
That's what he said.
He goes,
goes up top.
They just,

2233
02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:35.020
they're just trying to get rid of,
that's what his,
he didn't even know about it.

2234
02:09:35.050 --> 02:09:37.450
<v 0>Could you imagine if that's really what they did?</v>

2235
02:09:37.451 --> 02:09:40.750
If they rigged the building to explode to get rid of evidence,

2236
02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:46.230
shady stuff that they've been,
yeah,
but wait a minute,
do you think,
I mean how,

2237
02:09:46.231 --> 02:09:49.000
how deep you are willing to take it.
You want to take this with a guy to happen?

2238
02:09:49.150 --> 02:09:51.480
This is what the guy told me.
You know what I mean?
And this guy,
no,

2239
02:09:51.700 --> 02:09:54.700
well that makes sense with that building.
But how deep you willing to take it?

2240
02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:55.801
Are you willing to take it?

2241
02:09:55.801 --> 02:09:58.180
Do you believe that they could have let nine 11 happened?

2242
02:09:58.270 --> 02:10:00.730
They could have let those people fly those planes into those buildings?

2243
02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:04.740
<v 4>Well I think they,
the,
I would,
if I had to guess,</v>

2244
02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:08.040
it would be something similar to what they were going to do in Cuba.

2245
02:10:08.130 --> 02:10:10.410
They were already going to do something like that and like,
you know,

2246
02:10:10.411 --> 02:10:15.300
even Vietnam and Pearl Harbor,
they,
they,
you know,
government first,
you know,

2247
02:10:15.301 --> 02:10:18.540
maybe it's not even the government is people on over the government.

2248
02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:21.990
They need reasons to get into war.
We need the people behind it.

2249
02:10:22.170 --> 02:10:25.920
We need people waving American flags.
So w you know,
it's,

2250
02:10:25.980 --> 02:10:28.800
it's standard building empires one on one.

2251
02:10:28.930 --> 02:10:29.141
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2252
02:10:29.141 --> 02:10:34.040
They actually moved some of their warships out of the navy base

2253
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:36.740
<v 5>in Hawaii because they knew that they were going to be attacked.
Yeah.</v>

2254
02:10:36.750 --> 02:10:40.460
Move valuable ships.
Americans did not want to get into World War II.

2255
02:10:40.490 --> 02:10:45.470
We got into World War II,
B after the Japanese rated Pearl Harbor.

2256
02:10:45.590 --> 02:10:49.190
But we had known the Japanese.
Apparently the government supposedly had known,

2257
02:10:49.191 --> 02:10:51.680
I mean this was on the history channel.
They were talking about it nowadays.

2258
02:10:51.740 --> 02:10:55.940
Back then it was a conspiracy theory.
Now it's mainstream knowledge now that,

2259
02:10:56.840 --> 02:11:00.240
that,
uh,
uh,
America knew about and they let it happen.
They go,
perfect.
Well,

2260
02:11:00.241 --> 02:11:03.110
let them come in here and what the fuck they needed to get into the war.

2261
02:11:03.130 --> 02:11:08.130
The imagine the mindset that you have to have to allow US soldiers to die and

2262
02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:11.150
will allow them to die knowing that you're,

2263
02:11:11.151 --> 02:11:15.640
you're to manipulate the whole situation and bring people into more Northwoods.

2264
02:11:15.650 --> 02:11:18.770
Explain that really quick.
This is 1962,

2265
02:11:18.771 --> 02:11:23.270
the joint chiefs of Staff signed a document that was what they were gonna do was

2266
02:11:23.271 --> 02:11:27.230
they were gonna arm Cuban friendlies and have them attack one Tanam obey,

2267
02:11:27.231 --> 02:11:29.180
could have easily killed US soldiers.
Right.

2268
02:11:29.450 --> 02:11:34.400
They were gonna put a drone plane in the air and blow it up and blame it on the

2269
02:11:34.401 --> 02:11:38.090
Cubans and that was going to make people want to go to war with Cuba.
They were,

2270
02:11:38.091 --> 02:11:40.590
there was all these different things that they were doing to uh,

2271
02:11:40.820 --> 02:11:43.910
get people enthusiastic about going to war.
Man,
that's real.
Yeah,
that's right.

2272
02:11:44.090 --> 02:11:46.060
At the fast sign by the joint chiefs.

2273
02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:48.590
It wasn't like an idea that someone came up with it.
Everybody wants,

2274
02:11:48.591 --> 02:11:52.260
so I get the fuck out of here.
No,
they signed it and put it together.

2275
02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:57.100
Kennedy's as a plan.
Yeah.
Kennedy vetoed it.
So it's happened before,
you know,

2276
02:11:57.320 --> 02:12:00.280
it happened with Northwoods.
It happened in Pearl Harbor and you know,

2277
02:12:00.350 --> 02:12:03.680
no one went to jail.
That's what's really important,
man.
Getting into Vietnam,

2278
02:12:03.681 --> 02:12:04.610
that was all shady.

2279
02:12:04.611 --> 02:12:09.290
That was like some fake attack that look how we got into Iraq and Afghanistan.

2280
02:12:09.310 --> 02:12:10.970
Zach.
I mean,
I had a whole bit about that,

2281
02:12:11.410 --> 02:12:15.260
about like that people will feel like what they told on one.
Yeah.
How does,
yeah.

2282
02:12:15.261 --> 02:12:17.210
But I,
yeah,
sure.
But doesn't make any sense.

2283
02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:19.790
I mean like why I was talking to a friend of mine last night,

2284
02:12:19.791 --> 02:12:23.360
he's a really good guy,
but he's,
you know,
he's like real kind of Rah Rah.

2285
02:12:23.630 --> 02:12:27.200
And we were having this conversation about why we're in Afghanistan.
I go,

2286
02:12:27.210 --> 02:12:28.880
do you see a threat in Afghanistan?

2287
02:12:29.010 --> 02:12:31.300
When was the last time they even talked about like the,

2288
02:12:31.370 --> 02:12:34.340
the war in Afghanistan being,
because there's a threat and you know,

2289
02:12:34.610 --> 02:12:35.660
I hear about Afghanistan,

2290
02:12:35.661 --> 02:12:39.050
I hear about trillions of dollars in minerals and he'll hear about 90% of the

2291
02:12:39.051 --> 02:12:39.884
world's opium.

2292
02:12:39.980 --> 02:12:43.670
I hear about natural gas pipelines the Soviet Union wants to control.

2293
02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:47.510
I hear about all these incredible resources that this place has.

2294
02:12:47.670 --> 02:12:50.780
And then the whole countries like in this state of chaos,
you know,

2295
02:12:50.781 --> 02:12:54.270
I mean it's like one city and then a bunch of like warlords,
man.
I'm like,
what?

2296
02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:57.530
What were over there for what reason?
What do we,
what are we doing?

2297
02:12:57.531 --> 02:13:02.531
It's basically like if your wife cheated on you three times over your marriage,

2298
02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:07.250
and then there's all this evidence that she's doing it again and you're like,

2299
02:13:07.251 --> 02:13:10.550
no way.
She would never do it.
She would never do it.
Wait,
there's evidence.

2300
02:13:10.551 --> 02:13:15.070
It's not just we have like video evidence of her sucking the deaths and,

2301
02:13:15.550 --> 02:13:20.530
and you don't think she's shooting?
Oh,
the lighting and the shadows,
Bruh.

2302
02:13:20.640 --> 02:13:25.640
Ah,
you know,
shot bro.
Yeah.
It's that real.
I could do that.
Anybody can do that,

2303
02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:30.350
man.
So he's the enemy.
Our government has done this several times.

2304
02:13:30.351 --> 02:13:32.070
It's fact and we'll no,

2305
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:32.491
<v 0>no,
no.</v>

2306
02:13:32.491 --> 02:13:36.840
Nine one one was not niching insane of tower seven went down like a controlled

2307
02:13:36.841 --> 02:13:38.490
demo.
No plane hit it.
Oh,

2308
02:13:38.610 --> 02:13:43.260
it was a flyer like Jesus Christ.
That's incredible.

2309
02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:47.670
But it's way sexier to think that it was a controlled demo.
It's way sexier.

2310
02:13:47.671 --> 02:13:50.700
Thank that.
There's a bunch of dudes sitting there and they go pull it,
pull it,

2311
02:13:50.790 --> 02:13:53.260
and they hit the button and the whole way imploded and then they go,

2312
02:13:53.320 --> 02:13:55.740
don't worry about it.
Who's gonna?
Who's gonna know we're gonna,

2313
02:13:55.860 --> 02:13:59.660
we're gonna have to talk about this.
Don't worry about it.
I got it covered.
Yeah.

2314
02:14:00.300 --> 02:14:03.900
You know,
I wish,
I wish.
I wish our government,

2315
02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:06.720
like everyday our officials woke up and said,
you know,

2316
02:14:06.721 --> 02:14:09.390
we got to get together and we got to make it better for the people.

2317
02:14:09.391 --> 02:14:12.150
What are we going to do?
We're going to make the best country ever.

2318
02:14:12.270 --> 02:14:12.980
You know what I mean?

2319
02:14:12.980 --> 02:14:16.060
We're going to make the best concerts ABC after school special on.

2320
02:14:17.220 --> 02:14:21.750
I wish it was like that.
That's how it was in 1776 are are,
I mean,

2321
02:14:21.751 --> 02:14:24.120
look at JFK and all that shit.
You,

2322
02:14:24.310 --> 02:14:29.040
you put it all together and our government has every government really,

2323
02:14:29.041 --> 02:14:33.990
it's just like every government basically as a history of massive corruption.

2324
02:14:35.070 --> 02:14:39.330
These were in a corrupt government.
How could you not see that?

2325
02:14:39.331 --> 02:14:41.040
To See Putin get booed in Russia.

2326
02:14:41.580 --> 02:14:44.840
That's deep dude fade or beat up Monson and asteroids.

2327
02:14:44.850 --> 02:14:49.380
Putin got into the ring and congratulated fake door and thank Monson and I

2328
02:14:49.381 --> 02:14:51.840
didn't see that and they were booing him,
man.
He gave a speech.

2329
02:14:51.870 --> 02:14:55.140
He started talking.
They were booing him,
man,
because they're fed up,
man.

2330
02:14:55.320 --> 02:14:58.740
They're fed up with this guys pushed himself back into power.
You know,

2331
02:14:58.741 --> 02:15:02.100
he was supposed to be elected and then his talk was over and then that was it.

2332
02:15:02.310 --> 02:15:07.230
But he's like right back in the mix.
He never gave up power.
It wasn't about to,

2333
02:15:07.260 --> 02:15:10.990
that's a gangster dude.
Pollutants.
Putin is a bad motherfucker.

2334
02:15:11.090 --> 02:15:15.720
Judo black belt guy goes hunting and fishing and shit.
That's a man dude.
Yeah.

2335
02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:20.310
That's why everybody was terrified when the thought of Sarah Pailin actually

2336
02:15:20.311 --> 02:15:24.910
being the president.
Cause what if Putin,
I mean Putin is a God damn man.
If

2337
02:15:24.980 --> 02:15:28.490
<v 1>Sarah Palin actually became president,
what if they get an office?</v>

2338
02:15:28.491 --> 02:15:31.370
What if by some fucking stroke of the imagination,

2339
02:15:31.490 --> 02:15:36.080
what for whatever reason her and what's his face?
Get an office.
What's his name?

2340
02:15:37.010 --> 02:15:41.240
Brian.
The Guy who ran with Sarah Palin.
Jesus Christ.
John Mccain.

2341
02:15:41.241 --> 02:15:45.170
John Mccain had a brain fart.
John Mccain and Sarah Palin when go into office.

2342
02:15:45.230 --> 02:15:48.290
John McCain is an old man.
He's been around a long time.
I mean he's,

2343
02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:51.050
he's voc gets really old and you know,

2344
02:15:51.090 --> 02:15:55.540
I respect the guy and he was a war here on all that stuff.
But that's,
he's,
uh,

2345
02:15:55.610 --> 02:15:59.930
he's a very old man.
And to have that as his running mate,

2346
02:16:00.230 --> 02:16:04.490
that's his vice president.
So if he dies,
she becomes president.
So,
you know,

2347
02:16:04.491 --> 02:16:08.390
easily you look at it.
Wow.
Obama's turning gray.
Man,
Obama's getting great quick.

2348
02:16:08.391 --> 02:16:12.170
Have you noticed that dude looks tired all the time.
If that was John Mccain,

2349
02:16:12.230 --> 02:16:15.560
he might be dead.
So right now he gives out.
Boom.

2350
02:16:15.740 --> 02:16:20.740
Sarah Pailin has to sit down at a fucking negotiating table with Vladimir Putin.

2351
02:16:21.560 --> 02:16:22.430
Could you imagine,

2352
02:16:23.060 --> 02:16:26.540
could you imagine how that killer would stare down that Nimrod?

2353
02:16:26.930 --> 02:16:28.520
Imagine that conversation,

2354
02:16:28.670 --> 02:16:33.670
the between this international bad motherfucker and some big bat who doesn't

2355
02:16:34.481 --> 02:16:39.190
even read
you.
Imagine what that conversation would be like.

2356
02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:43.210
God Damn.
So what do you think about Ron Paul?

2357
02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:46.960
I think Ron Paul is a very sensible man.

2358
02:16:46.961 --> 02:16:50.410
He believes in some strange things.
He's very religious,

2359
02:16:50.620 --> 02:16:55.620
but his overwhelming belief in the constitution is more important to me than

2360
02:16:56.201 --> 02:16:58.800
whatever religious beliefs that he has to have,
you know,

2361
02:16:58.810 --> 02:17:03.040
to get him through his day or,
or you know,
chooses to subscribe to or whatever.

2362
02:17:03.041 --> 02:17:05.500
For whatever reason he believes in,
you know,
uh,

2363
02:17:05.590 --> 02:17:08.050
creationism and a lot of those other things.

2364
02:17:08.051 --> 02:17:09.580
He doesn't believe in the theory of evolution.

2365
02:17:09.581 --> 02:17:12.760
There's a lot of things and he doesn't believe in is fine with me.
I don't,

2366
02:17:12.790 --> 02:17:17.200
it doesn't bother me because his belief in the constitution and his belief in

2367
02:17:17.201 --> 02:17:19.120
what America really should be,
that we wouldn't,

2368
02:17:19.121 --> 02:17:20.920
shouldn't be the police of the world.

2369
02:17:20.980 --> 02:17:23.830
That we shouldn't be wasting our resources and all these different countries

2370
02:17:23.831 --> 02:17:28.720
that we should be strengthening up our country,
our inner cities,
our structures,

2371
02:17:28.721 --> 02:17:33.670
our business or manufacturing,
pull all that resources and stop giving it to,

2372
02:17:33.700 --> 02:17:37.480
uh,
all these fucking gigantic war companies because that's what their are,

2373
02:17:37.481 --> 02:17:38.710
their war profiteers.

2374
02:17:38.850 --> 02:17:42.130
And the war profiteers of hijack the whole system and the pharmaceutical

2375
02:17:42.131 --> 02:17:46.690
companies have hijacked the fucking drug laws so that there's a disproportionate

2376
02:17:46.691 --> 02:17:49.000
amount of people that want things that are in jail.

2377
02:17:49.001 --> 02:17:52.090
Because they want them because they're not sanctioned by the government and they

2378
02:17:52.091 --> 02:17:54.640
become nonviolent drug offenders when you know,

2379
02:17:54.641 --> 02:17:58.330
they could just get the prescription pill form and they'd be just as fucked up

2380
02:17:58.331 --> 02:18:02.020
and fine.
You know,
they,
they can't choose to do what they want to do.

2381
02:18:02.030 --> 02:18:06.970
That's the whole package is bought and sold.
So when you step in,
if you're,

2382
02:18:06.971 --> 02:18:09.420
if you're a president or a presidential candidate who have fucked,

2383
02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:12.220
you aren't man,
good luck.
Good luck fixing this mass.

2384
02:18:12.221 --> 02:18:15.070
Good luck fixing this tangled fishing line.

2385
02:18:15.310 --> 02:18:20.310
It's pretty amazing watching the debates and anybody that speaks that besides

2386
02:18:20.591 --> 02:18:23.780
Ron Paul,
you just,
it's like total bullshit.
Every,

2387
02:18:24.370 --> 02:18:27.670
everybody just nothing but bullshit.
And then Ron Paul,

2388
02:18:27.850 --> 02:18:32.350
that's like a real dude who's breaking it down in,
honestly,

2389
02:18:32.580 --> 02:18:36.820
he,
he,
you know,
his whole drug policy that's pretty,

2390
02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:39.790
that takes big balls that come out like that with his drug policy.

2391
02:18:39.791 --> 02:18:43.210
You know what I mean?
And,
and well,
there's evidence in other countries,
Portugal,

2392
02:18:43.211 --> 02:18:45.520
Portugal,
less people are addicted to drugs.

2393
02:18:45.521 --> 02:18:49.990
Less people are involved in prostitution because they made it illegal.
They made,

2394
02:18:50.050 --> 02:18:51.970
they may drugs legal.
They just said,
the fucking,

2395
02:18:51.971 --> 02:18:54.660
let's just decriminalize the whole pack.
That's what Ron Paul wants to do.

2396
02:18:54.690 --> 02:18:57.520
So it should be,
man,
you can't nanny state the fucking world.

2397
02:18:57.521 --> 02:19:00.820
Keep it from your kids.
Keep it from your communities.
You know,
and you know,

2398
02:19:00.821 --> 02:19:04.030
if people are selling and if they're pushing it there,
even if you feel like,

2399
02:19:04.150 --> 02:19:07.210
you know,
you can keep them out of your community,
man,
you know,
you could,

2400
02:19:07.211 --> 02:19:09.220
you could,
there they're criminals who should get rid of them,

2401
02:19:09.221 --> 02:19:11.980
but people who have it,
let them do whatever the fuck they want,
man.

2402
02:19:12.220 --> 02:19:15.140
Let them do whatever they want.
That's how it should be.
You know,
if you're,

2403
02:19:15.210 --> 02:19:17.860
they're not hurting you,
let them do it.
Let them do everything.

2404
02:19:17.890 --> 02:19:20.940
Let them try heroin.
I think it's stupid.
You want to do it?
Go ahead.

2405
02:19:20.941 --> 02:19:22.900
And I support it.
I don't want my kids to do it.

2406
02:19:22.930 --> 02:19:24.820
I'm going to try to educate them as much as possible.

2407
02:19:24.821 --> 02:19:28.340
Stay the fuck away from heroin,
but ultimately they can get it.
They can get it.

2408
02:19:28.341 --> 02:19:32.720
Anyway.
We are going to vote for
no,

2409
02:19:32.810 --> 02:19:35.670
that's who you gonna call Brian that form.
Awesome.
Uh,

2410
02:19:35.900 --> 02:19:39.990
Herman Cain just for a Goof,
not Ron Paul.
I think the whole thing's right.
Um,

2411
02:19:40.010 --> 02:19:42.290
yeah,
I'll vote for Ron Paul.
Sure.
I'll vote for Ron Paul.

2412
02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:45.020
But you know Ron Paul is probably not going to get into the position to be the

2413
02:19:45.021 --> 02:19:48.830
Republican nominee,
so I have to register as a Republican,
which is just gross.

2414
02:19:48.950 --> 02:19:52.520
Do you think they'd gone out of their way,
the media to ignore them?
Sure,

2415
02:19:52.521 --> 02:19:55.580
of course they are.
I saw one show,
this was the most hilarious version of it.

2416
02:19:55.581 --> 02:19:58.580
They were talking about how Mitt Romney at the time and Rick Perry,

2417
02:19:58.581 --> 02:20:01.750
we're battling out for the second and third spot there.

2418
02:20:01.750 --> 02:20:03.710
So battling out for number two and number three,

2419
02:20:03.711 --> 02:20:06.230
and then they started going into this whole battle between number two and number

2420
02:20:06.231 --> 02:20:07.850
three and what Mitt Romney needs to deal with.

2421
02:20:07.880 --> 02:20:12.350
Rick Perry needs to do it all the while ignoring Ron Paul because he was number

2422
02:20:12.351 --> 02:20:14.570
one.
They didn't even talk about Ron.

2423
02:20:14.750 --> 02:20:17.930
They just talked about these two dudes battling out for two and three and who's

2424
02:20:17.931 --> 02:20:20.360
going to emerge?
Why do you think the media is ignoring him?

2425
02:20:20.540 --> 02:20:22.640
Cause he's not media centric.
He's not,

2426
02:20:22.641 --> 02:20:25.400
he doesn't do anything that all these giant corporations want.

2427
02:20:25.760 --> 02:20:29.930
Everything that he says is like a utopia,
you know,

2428
02:20:29.931 --> 02:20:33.890
dream state where the military industrial complex doesn't really have control

2429
02:20:33.891 --> 02:20:37.640
over Congress and the politicians and everyone at the top of the heat bit.

2430
02:20:37.670 --> 02:20:41.390
But they really do.
They really do.
So what happens when he gets in place?

2431
02:20:41.540 --> 02:20:44.750
What happens when they put him in office and you know,
and then they go,

2432
02:20:44.751 --> 02:20:46.970
we're going to do what we're going to get out of us yet.
Afghanistan,

2433
02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:50.480
the fuck we are.
Sit Down Dude.
And then what happens?

2434
02:20:50.481 --> 02:20:53.840
Exactly what does he go on TV and tell it everybody,
you know,

2435
02:20:53.841 --> 02:20:56.360
they were just going to get them killed.
I mean what's going to happen then?

2436
02:20:56.361 --> 02:21:00.470
Is it going to be revealed that we actually live in a 100% complete police state

2437
02:21:00.680 --> 02:21:02.870
and now unfortunately because of Mr Paul's death,

2438
02:21:02.900 --> 02:21:06.530
the bullshit facade gets dropped and we just fucking march people into camps.

2439
02:21:07.400 --> 02:21:09.000
Don't you think they should read you the prejudice,

2440
02:21:10.250 --> 02:21:11.330
but don't you think they should read you?

2441
02:21:11.331 --> 02:21:14.180
The whole president thing where there's like multiple presidents,
like three.

2442
02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:17.090
That's a good idea.
A team of presidents is a good idea.

2443
02:21:17.430 --> 02:21:21.230
Know really the idea is based on tribes and monkeys.
It's really stupid.

2444
02:21:21.470 --> 02:21:24.920
It's great for 50 monkeys.
It's not good for 300 million human beings.

2445
02:21:25.100 --> 02:21:27.530
They have one person reside over everyone.

2446
02:21:27.531 --> 02:21:31.230
One person be our representative and we don't trust them enough to give them

2447
02:21:31.231 --> 02:21:33.920
more than of a four year stretch at the time.
You know,

2448
02:21:33.921 --> 02:21:36.860
we don't trust him to keep doing it and after eight years you're done.

2449
02:21:36.861 --> 02:21:40.010
Get the fuck out.
It doesn't matter if you're the best at your job of all time.

2450
02:21:40.310 --> 02:21:43.310
The temptation for corruption is just too powerful.

2451
02:21:43.311 --> 02:21:47.300
We will not allow the best person for the job to continue to have this job.

2452
02:21:47.630 --> 02:21:48.530
We won't allow them.

2453
02:21:48.680 --> 02:21:51.710
Even though the person who is probably best at the job has the most experience,

2454
02:21:51.790 --> 02:21:53.800
it doesn't have to be briefed,
doesn't have to.
Gino is,

2455
02:21:53.801 --> 02:21:55.640
is willing and able to continue it.

2456
02:21:55.641 --> 02:21:58.820
Bill Clinton would've done another four years.
The let them,
they're not,

2457
02:21:58.910 --> 02:21:59.540
I'm sorry.

2458
02:21:59.540 --> 02:22:03.080
Next guy moving in and we get to the next crook and town and this guy has got

2459
02:22:03.081 --> 02:22:05.870
his gang with him as Dick Cheney and Halliburton.

2460
02:22:05.871 --> 02:22:10.480
They come with fucking shovels and bags and he's stealing everything.
Dad,
Dah,

2461
02:22:10.481 --> 02:22:13.220
Dah,
Dah.
That's the funniest presidency of all time.

2462
02:22:13.490 --> 02:22:18.490
Ceo of Halliburton accompanied that makes its money by fixing shit after the

2463
02:22:18.741 --> 02:22:20.630
United States blows it up in war.

2464
02:22:20.900 --> 02:22:25.900
They get hot fucking billions of dollars and no bid contracts to fix stuff after

2465
02:22:27.721 --> 02:22:31.890
we blow it up because the guy who used to be their CEO wants to go to war and

2466
02:22:31.891 --> 02:22:36.600
Afghanistan and Iraq,
so he forces everybody to go to war.
He forces Bush into it.

2467
02:22:36.750 --> 02:22:41.280
They make fucking ans insane amounts of money and somehow or another,

2468
02:22:41.281 --> 02:22:44.360
the whole thing takes place in front of everybody's eyes.
If that's delay,

2469
02:22:44.550 --> 02:22:48.510
a brilliant jacking,
what is I think gangster,
think of that.

2470
02:22:48.511 --> 02:22:53.400
How could that even be legal?
How could it even be legal?
The idea,

2471
02:22:53.401 --> 02:22:54.440
the only way it could be legal,

2472
02:22:54.441 --> 02:22:59.441
as you would have to assume that this person for sure is incapable of doing

2473
02:22:59.551 --> 02:23:00.690
something inhumane,

2474
02:23:00.750 --> 02:23:04.830
like going to war for any reason other than the fact that American lives are in

2475
02:23:04.831 --> 02:23:08.070
danger.
There's no way they would go to war for just for profit.

2476
02:23:08.370 --> 02:23:12.120
That's unheard of.
So that has to be assumed.
Otherwise it couldn't.

2477
02:23:12.180 --> 02:23:13.230
It couldn't be allowed.

2478
02:23:13.470 --> 02:23:17.640
You wouldn't allow someone who was once a CEO of a company that fixes up shit.

2479
02:23:17.641 --> 02:23:22.380
We blow up to just start taking over and blowing things up at an unprecedented

2480
02:23:22.381 --> 02:23:25.950
rate.
Oh,
what a coincidence.
This guy as the vice president,

2481
02:23:25.951 --> 02:23:28.710
and now we've blown up more shit than ever in history.

2482
02:23:29.250 --> 02:23:32.520
Woopsies between totally coincidental.
Don't worry about that.

2483
02:23:33.630 --> 02:23:35.370
That guy doesn't have a heart anymore,
man.

2484
02:23:35.371 --> 02:23:37.740
They're going to electric heart in there pumping his shit.

2485
02:23:37.950 --> 02:23:40.260
He's got some crazy pacemaker where he doesn't have a pulse.

2486
02:23:41.310 --> 02:23:44.850
It's just kind of pump.
So his body is just pumping blood like literally he's a,

2487
02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:49.680
he's a Zombie Dick Cheney's like an antichrist Zombie.
He's got no heartbeat.

2488
02:23:50.400 --> 02:23:53.430
Think of that.
Think of that.
I mean is that not in the scriptures,
man,

2489
02:23:53.610 --> 02:23:58.290
a man who walks with no heartbeat and feels no remorse for the millions of

2490
02:23:58.291 --> 02:23:58.740
deaths.

2491
02:23:58.740 --> 02:24:01.670
That shit could have been the scriptures that easily could be in the scriptures.

2492
02:24:02.100 --> 02:24:03.780
Turn on your hard loud.

2493
02:24:03.920 --> 02:24:07.850
Those motherfuckers took us to war from money and an amazing number that we've

2494
02:24:07.851 --> 02:24:09.530
always done it.
People have always done that.

2495
02:24:09.710 --> 02:24:12.660
Remember that one bit or talk at my George Bush and how dummy.
Yeah,

2496
02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:16.130
we can go down there.
Yeah.
He know what they did with Sarah Palin.

2497
02:24:16.160 --> 02:24:18.950
They did go in gum or wow.
You know,
somebody took that and make that um,

2498
02:24:19.010 --> 02:24:21.200
clip from my 2005 special,

2499
02:24:21.470 --> 02:24:25.580
they took that clip and added it to 'em up a picture of Sarah Pailin at the end

2500
02:24:25.850 --> 02:24:29.270
and it said like,
really?
Yeah,
we can go dumber.
Can we see that?

2501
02:24:29.580 --> 02:24:33.320
Oh you it man,
you will find it.
No,
I don't want to play it anyway.

2502
02:24:33.380 --> 02:24:35.930
I don't want to hear myself to stand up for herself out.

2503
02:24:36.290 --> 02:24:41.290
Especially from 2005 I was like a little too little too yeley little too yet.

2504
02:24:41.630 --> 02:24:45.410
What's the word as your early,
early Rogan,

2505
02:24:45.420 --> 02:24:48.980
who's the man all the time,
early rogue,

2506
02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:52.820
angry before the weed really found it to be a tremendous waste of time.

2507
02:24:52.821 --> 02:24:57.050
Now I'm still occasionally angry,
but more,
more tongue in cheek than ever before.

2508
02:24:57.480 --> 02:24:59.500
At why?
As you get older,
till you start thinking way.

2509
02:24:59.530 --> 02:25:01.250
I've got to pick the things I'm mad at,
man,

2510
02:25:01.490 --> 02:25:04.220
because you can get mad at everything all day if you really want to.

2511
02:25:05.360 --> 02:25:07.190
I know people to get mad at everything all day.

2512
02:25:07.790 --> 02:25:10.790
You ever see people that are in relationships who get mad at everything all day?

2513
02:25:11.090 --> 02:25:14.750
Girls Nitpick it guys.
And the guy who fucking fires back and you go,
wow,

2514
02:25:15.020 --> 02:25:16.640
you guys are not handling this so well.

2515
02:25:16.940 --> 02:25:20.510
And then you guys are handling this kind of silly.
You don't have to do this.

2516
02:25:21.020 --> 02:25:25.420
You know,
that's,
that's hard.
It's hard to watch,
man.

2517
02:25:25.450 --> 02:25:28.350
Especially when people have kids.
Dude,
that's when it gets hard,
dude.

2518
02:25:28.750 --> 02:25:30.490
That's when it gets hard.
I'm gonna Front,

2519
02:25:30.850 --> 02:25:35.840
I got a friend who's got a kid and him his wife.
The,
um,
the,
the,
the,

2520
02:25:35.850 --> 02:25:37.570
you seem like they seem like an electric trailer.

2521
02:25:38.100 --> 02:25:40.300
[inaudible] they seem like they're,
they're both upset at each other.

2522
02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:44.110
Do I know him?
Yeah,
I know he talking about some fortunate,
you know,

2523
02:25:44.111 --> 02:25:46.600
it's like God damn,
you guys get this beautiful situation here.

2524
02:25:46.601 --> 02:25:49.510
You should love each other.
Come on,
get it together.
You know what?

2525
02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:53.140
Either one of them smoke weed.
That might be a part of the problem.

2526
02:25:54.130 --> 02:25:57.700
Right?
I think everybody needs a little weed man.
A little perspective.

2527
02:25:58.180 --> 02:26:00.340
Just a little perspective enhancer,
you know,

2528
02:26:00.341 --> 02:26:04.370
don't you think when you smoked me like smoking weed with your girl doesn't know

2529
02:26:04.380 --> 02:26:07.450
that this is a nice thing.
Yeah,
that's the best thing,
right?
It's like you,

2530
02:26:07.451 --> 02:26:10.750
you like,
you chilled together,
you know,
you hang out together.

2531
02:26:10.751 --> 02:26:13.710
It feels better when you kiss each other.
You know,
it's like a,

2532
02:26:13.711 --> 02:26:17.960
a super sensitivity drug,
you know,
makes you super sensitive man.

2533
02:26:17.980 --> 02:26:21.010
He makes you really,
really liked that person.
You know,

2534
02:26:21.011 --> 02:26:24.430
all their good qualities get accentuated.
You really appreciate them.

2535
02:26:24.670 --> 02:26:26.410
Almost like you're seeing with new eyes

2536
02:26:27.630 --> 02:26:31.350
<v 3>or you can get really paranoid freak the fuck out all the dot.
Guys.</v>

2537
02:26:32.820 --> 02:26:37.350
I was watching as here,
here.
Phantom buzzes for guys texting her and her phone.

2538
02:26:37.470 --> 02:26:41.370
Oh Man,
I've,
I've had some serious,
uh,
anxiety attacks now.

2539
02:26:41.850 --> 02:26:46.330
I was watching cops last night and it was like,
yeah,
I've had at least five.

2540
02:26:46.770 --> 02:26:50.140
<v 1>Firstly,
the biggest anxiety attack.
Sorry to break your hold onto that dog.
Brian.</v>

2541
02:26:50.141 --> 02:26:51.490
I want to hear these anxiety attacks.

2542
02:26:53.860 --> 02:26:56.920
<v 3>I never smoked pot growing up just once a year.</v>

2543
02:27:00.360 --> 02:27:04.170
Sorry Brian.
Get in there.
No,
I'm good.
Don't be scared of me.

2544
02:27:04.171 --> 02:27:05.810
I have to get on stage and solve it.

2545
02:27:05.950 --> 02:27:10.900
<v 1>That's perfect dude.
It's early.
It's only eight 20 man chosen star for two hours.</v>

2546
02:27:10.901 --> 02:27:14.190
Yeah,
get in there son.
Plus we're going to go get some food after this.

2547
02:27:14.310 --> 02:27:16.170
<v 3>We gotta hurry.
People are getting start getting here at nine.</v>

2548
02:27:16.740 --> 02:27:19.290
Why are they getting here an hour and a half early.
What did it do?
They uh,

2549
02:27:19.440 --> 02:27:20.273
chronicles.

2550
02:27:20.990 --> 02:27:21.823
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

2551
02:27:21.940 --> 02:27:23.350
<v 1>Oh,
who's coming in at nine?</v>

2552
02:27:24.880 --> 02:27:27.640
<v 3>I just told everyone to come in as close as nice as possible.
Oh,
okay.</v>

2553
02:27:28.150 --> 02:27:32.230
So they'll all be here around 10 like last time in high school,

2554
02:27:32.231 --> 02:27:35.350
I didn't smoke weed.
I like I said once a year at a party or something,

2555
02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:38.860
and I would always get paranoid wasn't into it at all.

2556
02:27:39.070 --> 02:27:42.610
I did not like smoking weed at all.
Growing up.
11th grade at lunch,

2557
02:27:43.150 --> 02:27:44.440
there was a big stoner crowd.

2558
02:27:44.441 --> 02:27:46.990
There's probably like a hundred people in the stoner crowd and everyone thought

2559
02:27:46.991 --> 02:27:50.950
I was a stoner cause I hung out in the stoner crowd.
But if you look closely,

2560
02:27:50.951 --> 02:27:55.930
I was like on the edge.
I wasn't really in windows in man.
That wasn't really it.

2561
02:27:55.931 --> 02:27:56.800
It appeared I was,

2562
02:27:56.801 --> 02:27:59.230
but actually wasn't hanging out with him and just me and three other guys on the

2563
02:27:59.231 --> 02:27:59.950
side.

2564
02:27:59.950 --> 02:28:03.250
And one day I got pulled into the crowd and they're passing around a joint and I

2565
02:28:03.251 --> 02:28:04.990
said,
fuck it.
I didn't want to be a Douche.

2566
02:28:05.140 --> 02:28:08.140
I was kind of like stoked that they pulled me in,
smoked a little bit of weed,

2567
02:28:08.141 --> 02:28:12.970
is that lunch and I walk to my next class and I sat to noon,
noon,
dude,
dude,
dude,

2568
02:28:13.270 --> 02:28:17.860
I sat down.
I was little [inaudible].
Yeah,
exactly.

2569
02:28:19.460 --> 02:28:22.040
So it was history and I'm sitting there was US history.

2570
02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:26.630
I'm so fucked up out of my mind.
I'm like,
I freaked out.
I was getting paranoid.

2571
02:28:26.631 --> 02:28:28.550
So I thought,
how am I going to get through this class?

2572
02:28:28.730 --> 02:28:31.550
So I got just look straight.
Don't look at anybody,
just look straight.

2573
02:28:31.670 --> 02:28:34.610
Don't do nothing.
I go,
Oh my God,
I'm freaking out,
but I'm not.

2574
02:28:34.611 --> 02:28:35.870
No one's gonna know.
No one's going to go.

2575
02:28:36.050 --> 02:28:41.050
And then I look to the side and there's people are looking back on [inaudible]

2576
02:28:41.580 --> 02:28:43.670
this,
my eyes got fucking,

2577
02:28:43.940 --> 02:28:46.550
they said they were people like turn it around pointing at my eyes.
And I'm like,

2578
02:28:46.610 --> 02:28:50.630
fuck,
don't look at me.
Please don't,
don't bring attention to everyone's laughing.

2579
02:28:50.631 --> 02:28:53.900
I'm like fuck.
And then some girl handed me or compact or look at your eyes.

2580
02:28:54.140 --> 02:28:57.410
I looked at my eyes and they were so red.

2581
02:28:57.440 --> 02:29:01.340
It was fucking like a zombies eyes.
You have,
um,

2582
02:29:01.430 --> 02:29:04.940
you have contacts.
Did you have contact?
No.
No,
I didn't have contacts back then.

2583
02:29:05.270 --> 02:29:09.200
Did you have glasses?
Like black frames?
Yes,
I did.
I did work every now and then.

2584
02:29:09.530 --> 02:29:13.640
Every now and then.
But not to school fog now,
but my,
I looked at at,

2585
02:29:13.641 --> 02:29:15.880
at my eyes and I three doubt,

2586
02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:20.750
I just stood up and walked out of class and when to the bathroom and I sat on

2587
02:29:20.751 --> 02:29:21.830
the bathroom floor.
Meanwhile,

2588
02:29:21.831 --> 02:29:24.950
everyone's in cloud and I sat on the bathroom floor just freaking out,

2589
02:29:24.980 --> 02:29:27.620
like just panicking like I was on crack or something.

2590
02:29:27.621 --> 02:29:30.070
Just shit on the bathroom floor.
The teacher calls the,

2591
02:29:30.130 --> 02:29:34.460
the campus cop total Azel big ass mustache.

2592
02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:36.920
Total asshole.
He opens the door.
Yes.

2593
02:29:36.980 --> 02:29:40.740
<v 1>What else does he opens the Lego.
You put those two together.
Total ass hole.</v>

2594
02:29:40.760 --> 02:29:41.580
Big Ass.

2595
02:29:41.580 --> 02:29:42.480
<v 3>I'll never forget him.</v>

2596
02:29:42.810 --> 02:29:45.690
He opens the bathroom door and I'm sitting down and he opens.
It goes,

2597
02:29:45.750 --> 02:29:48.390
what are you doing in here?
And I immediately started crying.
I'm

2598
02:29:51.670 --> 02:29:55.080
like,
I pretend like I was sick.
And everybody had known that I like,

2599
02:29:55.081 --> 02:29:58.740
I was fucked up on weed cause the teacher knew that everyone was laughing.

2600
02:29:58.741 --> 02:30:01.140
I just walk out of class.
He grabbed me by the neck,

2601
02:30:01.141 --> 02:30:03.780
pick me up and drag me to the principal's office and I'm like,

2602
02:30:04.020 --> 02:30:05.580
I just started crying.

2603
02:30:05.581 --> 02:30:09.540
So just pretending that I was sick and he knew I wasn't sick.

2604
02:30:09.541 --> 02:30:12.810
So he brought me to the,
uh,
the principal's office.
He had a toupee on,

2605
02:30:12.811 --> 02:30:17.400
it was awesome and he was really cool.
Here he goes,
what's wrong?
I go home sick.

2606
02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:21.630
I hate a bed,
corn dog.
I'm sick.
And he goes home and the cop was like,

2607
02:30:21.860 --> 02:30:25.050
it wasn't bonded at all,
but the principal just looked at me and said,

2608
02:30:26.770 --> 02:30:30.600
all right,
let him go home.
And he just let me go home.
And I just walked home,

2609
02:30:30.601 --> 02:30:32.730
like all fucked up.
I got home,

2610
02:30:32.820 --> 02:30:37.080
just laid down on my bed and I'll never forget looking at the VCR clock,

2611
02:30:37.200 --> 02:30:40.590
just watching the minutes click by just,
I couldn't wait.

2612
02:30:40.650 --> 02:30:42.840
It just seemed like it was gonna last forever.

2613
02:30:43.140 --> 02:30:46.250
Just watching the clock please feeling go away.
I hate,

2614
02:30:47.370 --> 02:30:49.000
<v 1>I hated it.
Yeah.</v>

2615
02:30:49.001 --> 02:30:53.230
I only got high up maybe a dozen times before I started getting high with you

2616
02:30:53.500 --> 02:30:55.180
over the course of my whole life.

2617
02:30:55.600 --> 02:31:00.080
But one time I did when I was 15 with this girl that I dated,
we,

2618
02:31:00.130 --> 02:31:03.190
she was a,
she,
it was her idea.
And my friend Josh,

2619
02:31:03.340 --> 02:31:08.340
we all three of us got high together and I was probably like 1514 maybe 1415 and

2620
02:31:09.641 --> 02:31:14.560
I stole my dad's.
We'd had some super strong weed,

2621
02:31:14.561 --> 02:31:18.940
man.
I mean it was,
I don't,
I mean I was a little kid,
right?
And I don't know,

2622
02:31:19.080 --> 02:31:20.520
we smoked it.
I don't remember anything.

2623
02:31:20.521 --> 02:31:23.610
But what I do remember is just lying on the couch.

2624
02:31:23.620 --> 02:31:26.250
My whole body just tangling,

2625
02:31:26.430 --> 02:31:30.300
like little electrical circuits are going off and my whole body,

2626
02:31:30.480 --> 02:31:32.400
and then I was time traveling.
I would,

2627
02:31:32.490 --> 02:31:36.240
I would be on my back on the couch and then boom,

2628
02:31:36.300 --> 02:31:39.360
I'd be in front of the refrigerator and I had no recollection of how I got
there.

2629
02:31:39.720 --> 02:31:43.230
It was like instantly I appeared in front of the refrigerator and then boom,

2630
02:31:43.260 --> 02:31:45.540
I was in the bedroom and I couldn't remember walking into the bedroom.

2631
02:31:45.820 --> 02:31:50.790
It's like my short term memory was so fucked that every few steps,

2632
02:31:50.850 --> 02:31:53.430
my whole brain just rebooted.
And I'm like,
how'd I get here?

2633
02:31:53.570 --> 02:31:57.660
It erased all the steps up to get to that point.
There was no memory.
I mean,

2634
02:31:57.661 --> 02:32:00.060
my brain was fucked.
We were both fucked.

2635
02:32:00.360 --> 02:32:03.600
Gago giggling that I was scared of weed after that for awhile.

2636
02:32:03.870 --> 02:32:07.700
I didn't do it again for for a long time.
That was a,
that was a scary one.
Yeah

2637
02:32:08.320 --> 02:32:11.980
<v 4>man.
I couldn't believe that people could function and smoke weed.</v>

2638
02:32:11.981 --> 02:32:15.400
I didn't get it guys in the bands that I was in growing up,

2639
02:32:15.660 --> 02:32:19.450
it was always one stoner or two stoners and every time he made a mistake playing

2640
02:32:19.451 --> 02:32:20.500
bass,
I'll be like,
blame the,

2641
02:32:20.501 --> 02:32:24.100
we'd go see you come in here and fucking stone that fucking weed just fucks your

2642
02:32:24.101 --> 02:32:25.180
brain up.
Cause you know,

2643
02:32:25.400 --> 02:32:28.200
<v 1>that's what I would do with Andy Dick on news radio.
Really?</v>

2644
02:32:28.250 --> 02:32:30.490
They would come in high and he wouldn't remember his lyrics.
Sunblock.

2645
02:32:30.510 --> 02:32:33.390
The freak is high again.
I could be all pissed.
I was totally mad.

2646
02:32:34.110 --> 02:32:38.470
I was such a dick to stoners growing up.
Me Too.
How was it Dick?
I was fully,

2647
02:32:38.570 --> 02:32:40.410
you're addicted people.
I'm sorry.
You're,
you're addicted.

2648
02:32:40.411 --> 02:32:42.990
The people that you're afraid of yourself being,
you know,

2649
02:32:42.991 --> 02:32:44.220
I was afraid of being a stoner.

2650
02:32:44.670 --> 02:32:45.840
<v 2>Will you say?
I just say,</v>

2651
02:32:45.841 --> 02:32:48.540
I was watching cops last night and I was thinking about in the future when

2652
02:32:48.541 --> 02:32:51.450
marijuana will probably be legal.
Uh,

2653
02:32:51.451 --> 02:32:55.410
and so this officer was just going off on this girl for having some weed.

2654
02:32:55.470 --> 02:32:58.110
Like it was,
you know,
like maybe a quarter or something like that.

2655
02:32:58.260 --> 02:32:59.790
But it was going off just like go on,

2656
02:32:59.791 --> 02:33:02.160
you know how I can't believe this weed and boom.
And I was thinking,

2657
02:33:02.250 --> 02:33:06.000
how silly is this video going to look like in 10 years when we'd completely

2658
02:33:06.001 --> 02:33:07.650
legal and it's like normal and everything.

2659
02:33:07.651 --> 02:33:09.930
Like you're going to look back at how this cop was going.

2660
02:33:09.931 --> 02:33:12.030
Fucking ape shit on something that's like vitamins.

2661
02:33:12.060 --> 02:33:15.270
I wonder if we'd is going to be legal in 10 years.
I mean,

2662
02:33:15.271 --> 02:33:17.820
I would like to think it would be,
but honestly I'm not sure.

2663
02:33:17.821 --> 02:33:22.410
Because if you go back to like the 1970s hunter s Thompson was given speeches at

2664
02:33:22.411 --> 02:33:26.400
universities and shit and they were talking about legalization of marijuana and

2665
02:33:26.401 --> 02:33:30.000
you know,
he's like,
oh,
it's inevitable.
Maybe a doctor.
That's what he said,

2666
02:33:30.240 --> 02:33:33.200
like maybe a decade,
maybe we'll know.
Maybe never man,

2667
02:33:33.210 --> 02:33:36.780
2011 illegal in all the shit we know now.

2668
02:33:36.810 --> 02:33:38.520
The fact that it's illegal now is absolutely

2669
02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:42.060
<v 1>partially it flies in the face of science,
flies in the face of logic.</v>

2670
02:33:42.061 --> 02:33:44.670
There's no reason for them to be,
to be protecting us from it.

2671
02:33:44.940 --> 02:33:49.080
The only reason to keep it legal at this point is there's two reasons.
One,

2672
02:33:49.081 --> 02:33:51.630
because you don't want to ever admit you were wrong and let all those people out

2673
02:33:51.631 --> 02:33:53.910
of jail that you locked up for it.
And two,

2674
02:33:54.870 --> 02:33:59.370
<v 4>what is the two?
Uh,
don't fart in the bathtub.
No,</v>

2675
02:34:02.900 --> 02:34:05.850
<v 1>there's no,
there's no other,
I don't know what the second,
my second point was.</v>

2676
02:34:05.910 --> 02:34:08.430
There's no logical reason you have to be bought and paid by the pharmaceutical

2677
02:34:08.431 --> 02:34:09.300
companies.
So that's the only,

2678
02:34:09.301 --> 02:34:12.600
that's the only logical reason either you don't want to admit that you,
you know,

2679
02:34:12.601 --> 02:34:13.620
you fucked up in the past.

2680
02:34:13.621 --> 02:34:17.140
You don't want to re phrase the laws because then you open up this conundrum of

2681
02:34:17.141 --> 02:34:20.020
you being guilty of walking people in jail for something that's not really a

2682
02:34:20.021 --> 02:34:23.350
crime.
It's either that or you're being bought and paid for them.

2683
02:34:23.460 --> 02:34:26.470
Somebody is paying to make sure that you don't have these things legal cause

2684
02:34:26.471 --> 02:34:29.800
it's clear that you're not protecting anybody.
But we've come a long way though.

2685
02:34:29.920 --> 02:34:33.940
We have in California,
Spencer's and 14 other states too.

2686
02:34:33.941 --> 02:34:36.430
I've been able to read about people getting arrested left and right though on

2687
02:34:36.431 --> 02:34:36.730
Twitter.

2688
02:34:36.730 --> 02:34:39.790
People always send me things about like some high school kid gets arrested for

2689
02:34:39.791 --> 02:34:43.360
weed and I was doing three years in jail.
You know,
you hear about this shit.

2690
02:34:43.370 --> 02:34:44.830
It's still happening in the country.

2691
02:34:45.790 --> 02:34:48.460
It's becoming more and more illegal,

2692
02:34:48.550 --> 02:34:52.600
but every now and then you've got little dips like,
oh,

2693
02:34:53.320 --> 02:34:57.400
it's going to be hard.
It is hard.
But in California we'll never go back.

2694
02:34:57.401 --> 02:35:00.580
You know what I'm using as a model though?
I'm using this occupy Wall Street.

2695
02:35:00.581 --> 02:35:04.000
It's hard to stop this occupy Wall Street,
but boy are they fucking trying.

2696
02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:06.790
They're getting violent.
The getting violent about it.

2697
02:35:06.791 --> 02:35:10.270
And you see this Uc Davis footage or these cops spraying these pepper spray

2698
02:35:10.960 --> 02:35:15.250
spraying this shitness kids face,
all of them,
little kids at point blank range.

2699
02:35:15.500 --> 02:35:18.860
It's seeing them jabbing people with Bhutan's like

2700
02:35:18.940 --> 02:35:20.290
<v 2>they are reacting.</v>

2701
02:35:20.320 --> 02:35:23.500
But all these officers are getting in trouble for it or I'll get,
yeah,

2702
02:35:23.501 --> 02:35:25.250
they're getting suspended and all this.

2703
02:35:25.350 --> 02:35:29.050
So I don't think it's crazy because I think they realized that everyone has

2704
02:35:29.051 --> 02:35:33.610
cameras that they have to follow some kind of rules because we're all gonna know

2705
02:35:33.611 --> 02:35:36.100
about it.
And like,
I would like to believe that.

2706
02:35:36.101 --> 02:35:37.960
But you know that Tony Bologna Guy,

2707
02:35:37.961 --> 02:35:40.240
that guy who a pepper sprayed those girls in New York,

2708
02:35:40.241 --> 02:35:43.960
like one of the first instances that guy only lost 10 vacation days,

2709
02:35:44.230 --> 02:35:47.230
10 paid vacation days.
That's it.
Like I should be fired.

2710
02:35:47.350 --> 02:35:49.720
There's no way you should be allowed to be a fucking cop.

2711
02:35:49.721 --> 02:35:52.990
And that's what you want to do to some girls.
Just pepper spray him in the face.

2712
02:35:53.170 --> 02:35:55.060
You've got them all corralled in one spot.

2713
02:35:55.061 --> 02:35:59.070
He use pepper spray him in the face is he is um,
an officer,
uh,

2714
02:35:59.080 --> 02:36:00.610
this is not to defend them or anything,

2715
02:36:00.730 --> 02:36:03.950
but he is an officer and he probably doesn't make a lot of money out.

2716
02:36:03.970 --> 02:36:06.970
Imagine 10 vacation days.
That's ridiculous.

2717
02:36:06.971 --> 02:36:10.230
But that is also a lot of money probably for him,
you know?

2718
02:36:10.231 --> 02:36:11.680
And so it is a lot of money.

2719
02:36:11.681 --> 02:36:14.990
It's a lot of money for him doing a job that he did not do well.
No,
no.

2720
02:36:15.010 --> 02:36:18.220
I'm just saying so it is a penalty.
Like you're,
if you're an officer,

2721
02:36:18.221 --> 02:36:19.690
you're not going to be like,
dude,
that is,

2722
02:36:19.691 --> 02:36:23.380
I'm not going to go crazy because I don't want to lose fucking 10 vacation days.

2723
02:36:23.400 --> 02:36:25.240
You know they're getting him the obviously fought.

2724
02:36:25.280 --> 02:36:29.120
<v 1>The union must have fought to keep that guy in in position because that's the</v>

2725
02:36:29.121 --> 02:36:29.990
only thing that makes sense.

2726
02:36:30.320 --> 02:36:34.280
It's like when you see shit like the guy that the guy at Uc Davis that pepper

2727
02:36:34.281 --> 02:36:36.200
sprayed those kids in the face.
I don't know what happened to him,

2728
02:36:36.380 --> 02:36:40.040
but there's no way that guy should ever be in charge ever of enforcing the law.

2729
02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:43.310
There's no way that guy could,
should ever call himself an officer of the piece.

2730
02:36:43.550 --> 02:36:47.120
There's a bunch of little kids.
They could be my daughters,
they could be my sons.

2731
02:36:47.121 --> 02:36:50.150
They're 1618 years old,
whatever the fuck they are,
and your,

2732
02:36:50.151 --> 02:36:53.990
your pepper sprayed him in the face.
Fuck you.
That's just disgusting.

2733
02:36:54.140 --> 02:36:55.640
I don't care if they weren't listening to you.

2734
02:36:55.641 --> 02:36:59.810
I don't care what you're doing is disgusting.
That's disgusting.
It's malicious,

2735
02:36:59.811 --> 02:37:02.600
it's sadistic.
You're,
you know what you're doing.

2736
02:37:02.601 --> 02:37:04.520
You're spraying them in the face to teach them a lesson.

2737
02:37:04.521 --> 02:37:07.640
You're inflicting pain on them to get them away from you and you think you're

2738
02:37:07.641 --> 02:37:11.420
being slick about it.
You think it's your job in the world says fuck you.

2739
02:37:11.510 --> 02:37:14.730
And that's why the world took that guy's picture and put it online and put his

2740
02:37:15.220 --> 02:37:16.490
online shops.

2741
02:37:16.580 --> 02:37:19.970
<v 2>Yeah,
he's,
yeah,
he's a that guys.
That's a bad example.</v>

2742
02:37:20.010 --> 02:37:21.440
You think I should do a pepper spray,

2743
02:37:21.441 --> 02:37:24.400
a fetish video where I just get sprayed by this girl with a,

2744
02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:25.520
it's not real pepper spray,

2745
02:37:25.521 --> 02:37:28.460
but I have to act like you're going to become a fetish porn star.

2746
02:37:28.580 --> 02:37:31.760
I just want to know because I don't think I continue to work with you in this

2747
02:37:31.761 --> 02:37:32.594
capacity.

2748
02:37:32.870 --> 02:37:37.580
You start doing rape fetish videos will get tied up in trunks due to five
pounds.

2749
02:37:37.581 --> 02:37:40.040
There's a real video you out there,
you're getting tied up and trunks.

2750
02:37:40.041 --> 02:37:44.120
Do you show them your ass for 400 bucks?
No,
but if there's anything porn about,

2751
02:37:44.121 --> 02:37:48.050
if it's just 30 minutes and he does fine Bonser for the podcast.
Okay.

2752
02:37:48.051 --> 02:37:48.801
That's what you need.

2753
02:37:48.801 --> 02:37:52.130
You don't need to be sticking your ass in the air and letting these guys duct

2754
02:37:52.131 --> 02:37:52.964
tape your mouth.

2755
02:37:53.210 --> 02:37:55.550
They're going to fuck you and they're going to say that you agreed to it because

2756
02:37:55.551 --> 02:37:58.580
you're not going to read the contract.
So in some fine line.
Oh yeah.

2757
02:37:58.581 --> 02:37:59.440
And we get to fucking ass.

2758
02:37:59.610 --> 02:38:03.860
It probably is like written in there and undo a bunch of legal Mumbo jumbo.

2759
02:38:03.861 --> 02:38:07.490
As long as the client understands that forcible anal sex is a big part of the

2760
02:38:07.491 --> 02:38:10.460
program.
Thanks.
Bye.
Just put death squad TV on it.
Yeah.

2761
02:38:10.670 --> 02:38:13.370
If I just make it and make my own.
Yeah.
Why don't you make videos?

2762
02:38:13.371 --> 02:38:15.890
Are you getting fucked in the ass?
So be worth a lot of money,
but no,

2763
02:38:15.891 --> 02:38:17.910
no assets and if you want to make money though,

2764
02:38:17.960 --> 02:38:21.320
there's a fetish there for people that like looking at people tied up.

2765
02:38:21.350 --> 02:38:24.170
Let's build,
I start my own fetish of just people getting tied up.

2766
02:38:24.171 --> 02:38:25.990
It made it really cool.
It's build it up slow.

2767
02:38:27.440 --> 02:38:31.250
Like we're starting up with that and then eventually we're going to go for the

2768
02:38:31.251 --> 02:38:34.580
big bucks.
We're going to have a guy.
Fuck you.
No,
no.
Come on.

2769
02:38:34.940 --> 02:38:39.340
We'd have a stunt need to go for the big bucks.
Okay.
Stun asshole asshole corpse.

2770
02:38:39.470 --> 02:38:43.820
Like bullied.
Get a court on King Kong 1930s claymation no,

2771
02:38:43.821 --> 02:38:47.600
we can do it like this.
Hold the patient.
Like the wide shot would be a dollar,

2772
02:38:47.601 --> 02:38:49.880
but the tight shot will be a girlfriend with a strap on.

2773
02:38:49.881 --> 02:38:52.350
They won't be able to tell.
You know what I'm saying?
You just,

2774
02:38:52.370 --> 02:38:53.150
it's all in editing.

2775
02:38:53.150 --> 02:38:57.510
I black girl don't feel like compromise the idea of doing these videos doesn't

2776
02:38:57.511 --> 02:38:58.130
it?

2777
02:38:58.130 --> 02:39:01.130
You don't think that people are gonna like get off on the idea you being taped

2778
02:39:01.131 --> 02:39:04.130
up and maybe want to find you a tape you up.
Uh,
yeah,
that's,

2779
02:39:04.131 --> 02:39:05.970
I never thought of that angle but that's a good thing.

2780
02:39:06.260 --> 02:39:08.060
It's definitely so I wouldn't do that one.

2781
02:39:08.061 --> 02:39:11.810
I would do stuff like just guys with a dirty nails.

2782
02:39:11.840 --> 02:39:16.040
No you should do.
You should do now just stepping pudding before.

2783
02:39:16.070 --> 02:39:18.950
What you should do is make one.
This is a no lose situation.

2784
02:39:18.951 --> 02:39:22.190
Make one where you shoot laser beams out of your eyes.

2785
02:39:22.790 --> 02:39:25.790
You stare at a girl in the eyes and it causes her to have to suck your Dick.

2786
02:39:27.050 --> 02:39:29.270
Then where everywhere you go,
girls won't want to talk to your deck.

2787
02:39:29.330 --> 02:39:31.340
Like there's no way that works.
Oh my God,
it does work.

2788
02:39:31.490 --> 02:39:34.630
The craziest girls would just immediately start blowing you.
He's,

2789
02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:39.380
he really does have hypnotic powers.
I do.
Can you just tell them that's,
that's,

2790
02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:41.060
that's what you do if you're smart or not.

2791
02:39:41.061 --> 02:39:45.290
This other fucking bondage thing holding him,
watching TV.

2792
02:39:45.291 --> 02:39:47.960
It's just you and a friend holding hands and watching TV,

2793
02:39:48.100 --> 02:39:49.610
but you're not doing anything else.

2794
02:39:49.610 --> 02:39:51.710
You're just holding each other's hand while watching some TV.

2795
02:39:51.770 --> 02:39:54.620
As long as you can like rub fingers and thumbs together.

2796
02:39:54.621 --> 02:39:58.120
Not just hold hands but caress him.
I didn't think of that.
Well,
what if I had a,

2797
02:39:58.220 --> 02:40:02.030
I had to wear white gloves if we were both wearing white gloves.
Hmm.

2798
02:40:02.060 --> 02:40:04.520
That's better for sure.
But yeah,
you just hold them white glove,

2799
02:40:04.521 --> 02:40:07.070
but maybe it feels even more gay because it's all slippery.

2800
02:40:07.071 --> 02:40:08.900
The cloth against the cloth,

2801
02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:11.510
put some cat litter in there until it feels uncomfortable the whole time you're

2802
02:40:11.511 --> 02:40:15.830
getting cut by those crystals.
Crystals,
you just ruin the whole thing.
Fuck.

2803
02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:18.120
Put it inside the glove so it's not comfortable.
Why?

2804
02:40:18.121 --> 02:40:19.980
Why do you want to do gay things on video for money?

2805
02:40:19.981 --> 02:40:22.260
I don't really know if someone offering you something.
No,
no,
I'm not.

2806
02:40:22.261 --> 02:40:24.960
I'm really not doing this.
I said,
so you gay Hustler,
Huh?
No,

2807
02:40:25.110 --> 02:40:27.350
I'm just thinking that.
I know there's a fetish there right now that uh,

2808
02:40:27.600 --> 02:40:31.110
I've seen that there's people that buy and there's people that are making money

2809
02:40:31.170 --> 02:40:35.430
off these crazy videos of nothing of guises.
I learned nothing,
man.

2810
02:40:35.460 --> 02:40:37.350
It's hard during wise.
Really?

2811
02:40:37.620 --> 02:40:40.170
Well we were talking about is not that stuff that you're talking about getting

2812
02:40:40.171 --> 02:40:40.621
tied up.

2813
02:40:40.621 --> 02:40:44.910
It's hard to find people that are into you being tied up and those people,

2814
02:40:44.911 --> 02:40:47.850
man and everything.
You don't want to work in that market.
Yeah,
I don't.
Yeah.

2815
02:40:48.180 --> 02:40:50.030
You don't want to be a common part of that mark.
Right.

2816
02:40:50.130 --> 02:40:55.130
You can be really famous in that in a nice white guy posters and shit and you

2817
02:40:55.831 --> 02:40:58.670
all tied up.
There's like posters and yeah,

2818
02:40:59.130 --> 02:41:02.880
you can be the number one guy that everybody wants to rape and you can be like,

2819
02:41:02.940 --> 02:41:06.990
you know,
you could be like the Traci lords of trunk rape,
Trump videos,

2820
02:41:07.320 --> 02:41:12.270
get stalkers.
I've been able to get a lot of Dexter fans.
I bet.
I Bet Michael C.

2821
02:41:12.270 --> 02:41:17.070
Hall has that.
Those fans like this creepy Guy Tiller fairs.
They are wonder man,

2822
02:41:17.130 --> 02:41:19.680
I wonder how many dudes out there want to be serial killers but they don't want

2823
02:41:19.681 --> 02:41:21.840
to go to jail.
So like Ah,
it's not worth it.

2824
02:41:22.050 --> 02:41:26.130
So they open up a Christian bookstore instead.
Christian books.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2825
02:41:26.310 --> 02:41:30.150
Just to fight it off like you to say like dudes do it like Ted Haggard to fight

2826
02:41:30.151 --> 02:41:33.920
off the gay.
They just go super,
super,
Super Christian to try to fight outside.

2827
02:41:33.970 --> 02:41:35.490
Most priests.
Yeah.

2828
02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:38.300
<v 1>Yeah.
Most of them.
Maybe all of them.</v>

2829
02:41:38.450 --> 02:41:41.420
Wouldn't that be crazy for the Catholic church really was just an organization

2830
02:41:41.421 --> 02:41:42.254
that kid fuckers,

2831
02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:46.580
I mean it was a cult in ancient cult of kid fuckers and they just slowly but

2832
02:41:46.581 --> 02:41:50.300
surely integrated their way into the cities and the common laws they are,

2833
02:41:50.301 --> 02:41:52.580
that raises Skilton control.

2834
02:41:52.890 --> 02:41:54.570
<v 4>Well they used to do as well.</v>

2835
02:41:54.700 --> 02:41:57.310
It wasn't always illegal for the priest to get laid.
Yeah.

2836
02:41:57.410 --> 02:42:00.390
They actually could have got land like most other denominations,

2837
02:42:00.391 --> 02:42:03.750
but they were getting too much personally.
They were like rock stars.

2838
02:42:04.290 --> 02:42:06.060
Like the dude's,
they were going to the church,

2839
02:42:06.061 --> 02:42:10.170
they were like hating on the priests because their wives wanted a bottom.

2840
02:42:10.470 --> 02:42:14.760
So people were leaving and then they decided,
you know what,
to save the church,

2841
02:42:14.761 --> 02:42:17.310
we gotta we gotta outlaw getting laid for these dudes.

2842
02:42:17.700 --> 02:42:20.860
Humanitarian can imagine what the priest at the time when they did,

2843
02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:24.090
when they were thinking about outline posey what they were thinking,

2844
02:42:24.750 --> 02:42:27.120
their lives are coming to a fucking halt.

2845
02:42:29.630 --> 02:42:32.640
<v 1>Yeah.
They probably thought about the same way.
All those,
um,</v>

2846
02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:34.790
Wall Street people start talking and when the,

2847
02:42:34.810 --> 02:42:36.920
when they started talking about cracking down on Wall Street.

2848
02:42:37.340 --> 02:42:41.180
<v 2>Yeah.
Like do hard.
The party's over,
sir.
What parties over?</v>

2849
02:42:42.500 --> 02:42:45.440
Yeah,
no,
there they're probably fighting.
It came out in the fucking priest.

2850
02:42:45.441 --> 02:42:49.310
They were fighting us going to the emperor.
But your highness please.

2851
02:42:49.311 --> 02:42:53.000
Why became a priest?
Yeah.
So then all those guys end up quitting.
Right.

2852
02:42:53.430 --> 02:42:56.330
They're like,
fuck that.
You know what I mean?
No more pussy.
Fuck.
They quit.

2853
02:42:56.510 --> 02:42:58.550
<v 4>So the only guys that would take the job or dudes,</v>

2854
02:42:58.551 --> 02:43:00.430
it didn't give a fuck about pussy.
What came through

2855
02:43:00.460 --> 02:43:01.750
<v 1>first?
What came first?</v>

2856
02:43:01.780 --> 02:43:06.010
The confession booth or where priests couldn't get pussy anymore,

2857
02:43:06.160 --> 02:43:07.810
which came first.
That's very important.

2858
02:43:08.540 --> 02:43:10.210
<v 2>Kidding him.
Pussy of course.
You think so.</v>

2859
02:43:10.211 --> 02:43:12.160
That came first and the confession booth came

2860
02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:14.620
<v 3>after that.
Definitely.
Really?
Yeah.
Hmm.</v>

2861
02:43:15.070 --> 02:43:18.320
I wonder in the confession booth for little kids,

2862
02:43:18.640 --> 02:43:20.770
probably like the plastic container of a fleshlight.

2863
02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:24.760
Maybe they really tried to keep it together and for a while they just beat off

2864
02:43:24.761 --> 02:43:28.640
in their white girls told crazy fuck stories.
They go,
yeah,
you know what?
The law,

2865
02:43:28.670 --> 02:43:30.310
the policy first,
but they let I go,
you know what?

2866
02:43:30.311 --> 02:43:34.040
We got to come up with something else.
Beat off,
beat up.

2867
02:43:35.260 --> 02:43:36.550
That's why they had crazy robes.

2868
02:43:36.551 --> 02:43:39.550
You can use this loads just disappear under those things.
Yeah.

2869
02:43:40.600 --> 02:43:44.620
The first time I was going to catechism and that's like school to train,

2870
02:43:44.621 --> 02:43:46.300
how to be a Catholic,
you know what I mean?

2871
02:43:46.450 --> 02:43:48.100
I'm a kid and they told us about confession,

2872
02:43:48.101 --> 02:43:51.790
we got to go to confession and I was like fuck.
I mean I was thinking,

2873
02:43:51.791 --> 02:43:54.550
am I going to have to talk about me playing with myself?
You know what I mean?

2874
02:43:54.551 --> 02:43:58.000
Like that was a big concern because I really believed that this priest had

2875
02:43:58.001 --> 02:44:00.520
connections with God and now God's gonna find out that I'm beating out.

2876
02:44:00.670 --> 02:44:04.240
So that was a big concern.
And I asked my catechism teacher,
I'm like,

2877
02:44:04.630 --> 02:44:08.140
cause cause you're supposed to say all your sins and then the PN please God

2878
02:44:08.141 --> 02:44:10.870
forgive me for all of these sins and all my other past sins,

2879
02:44:10.871 --> 02:44:14.530
like the ones you couldn't remember.
So I asked him,
I asked my catechism,

2880
02:44:14.531 --> 02:44:18.940
teacher would have,
I don't say I leave one of my sins out.

2881
02:44:19.270 --> 02:44:22.870
Could that part at the end cover it for like these and all my other sins when

2882
02:44:22.871 --> 02:44:27.100
she goes,
nope.
If you remember it,
you got to say it.
I'm like,
oh Jesus,

2883
02:44:27.101 --> 02:44:29.450
how the fuck am I going to confess?
Playing with myself?

2884
02:44:29.510 --> 02:44:31.630
I didn't call it beating off.
We didn't call it jerk and office,

2885
02:44:31.631 --> 02:44:34.090
like playing with myself.
I was like eight years old going,
fuck,

2886
02:44:34.280 --> 02:44:38.170
this is going to be hard.
So I practiced that shit and I went,

2887
02:44:38.200 --> 02:44:40.360
I just want her to fucking blaze right through it,

2888
02:44:40.361 --> 02:44:44.740
right over it and not hesitate.
So I'm like,
you know,
hi.
It's been,
it's,
you know,

2889
02:44:44.741 --> 02:44:49.030
this is my first confession.
These are my sins.
I stole a candy bar.

2890
02:44:49.150 --> 02:44:52.810
I yelled at my brother,
I lied to my mom.
I played with myself.

2891
02:44:52.811 --> 02:44:56.950
I cheated on a homework and you know,
I'd be,
I just like go right over here,

2892
02:44:58.210 --> 02:45:01.420
put it in the room.
I was hoping you wouldn't ask them.
I like,

2893
02:45:01.540 --> 02:45:05.710
I was hoping he wouldn't go.
Wait a minute,
back up a little bit there.

2894
02:45:06.520 --> 02:45:08.980
What do you mean by playing with yourself?
Like,
Oh,

2895
02:45:09.190 --> 02:45:10.810
that was my nightmare and he did.
They never,

2896
02:45:10.840 --> 02:45:14.980
they never asked me to explain myself.
He didn't.
Oh,
he did good.

2897
02:45:15.040 --> 02:45:15.890
He didn't do too.

2898
02:45:15.891 --> 02:45:18.220
What a panic it would be if that's the only one he picked up on.

2899
02:45:18.221 --> 02:45:20.380
What you did want?
What is paid with deals?

2900
02:45:22.930 --> 02:45:27.000
What does that mean?
Explain yourself described to me and good.

2901
02:45:29.440 --> 02:45:30.273
Yeah.
No,

2902
02:45:30.280 --> 02:45:35.080
you hear the clank of glass on aluminum as he unscrews whose job?

2903
02:45:35.081 --> 02:45:39.040
Absolutely.
Hold on,
hold on,
hold on,
hold on.
Back Up.
Hold on one second.
One Sec.

2904
02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:43.030
What did you do in detail?
In detail?
Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
I'm not going to talk.

2905
02:45:43.031 --> 02:45:47.860
I just want to hear you play with yourself so well.

2906
02:45:47.920 --> 02:45:52.780
I was alone in the tub and I just was watching it and it felt so good.

2907
02:45:52.781 --> 02:45:55.690
I didn't want to stop washing it and next thing you know I wasn't,

2908
02:45:55.780 --> 02:46:00.010
I wasn't even watching it anymore.
I was just cause it was a sinful,

2909
02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:02.950
it was just for pleasure.
Why did you do man?

2910
02:46:02.951 --> 02:46:06.070
My Dick was so small back then when I started playing with myself I couldn't

2911

I want to call it little Conan little cone and little Conan the barbarian.

2920

That's a cool thing about,

2936
02:47:27.311 --> 02:47:30.850
All you have to do is put something out there and if it's good it will spread.

2937
02:47:31.060 --> 02:47:35.290
You know everything spreads.
That video of Joey Diaz crashing through the thing.

2938
02:47:35.291 --> 02:47:36.670
It didn't work.
It didn't come through for you.

2939

Nudity though,

Yes.

2942
02:47:44.751 --> 02:47:49.370

If you've seen a Eddie,

2944
02:47:53.901 --> 02:47:57.230
That's why we can play it.
Which one?
Joey Diaz.

2945
02:47:57.231 --> 02:48:00.800

Yeah,

2950
02:48:15.470 --> 02:48:17.590
We got to remove that.
Yeah,

2951
02:48:17.591 --> 02:48:20.170
they got mad at me with some of the stuff that I put up my website.

2952
02:48:21.400 --> 02:48:23.200
Did you have to take anything else don,

2953
02:48:23.230 --> 02:48:25.210
Like I don't really know of you taking anything.

2954

<v 1>Yeah.
There was a bunch of pictures with Joey and a slut.</v>

2955
02:48:28.560 --> 02:48:32.660
So some wild creature.
Yeah.
It was just as good.

2956
02:48:32.990 --> 02:48:35.890
It was bizarre.
It was like all of a sudden.

what kind of a site do I have here?

2958
02:48:40.100 --> 02:48:41.690
<v 2>He hated that.</v>

2959
02:48:41.920 --> 02:48:46.540
That old Joe showed the porn one with your friend Mike St pier or what's his

Fuck Hollywood

2966
02:49:09.380 --> 02:49:11.280

It's weird.
As I got older,</v>

2967
02:49:11.281 --> 02:49:13.740
when I think about how crazy and chaotic Hollywood really is,

2968
02:49:13.741 --> 02:49:16.230
I couldn't imagine living there.
It's so strange.

2969
02:49:16.231 --> 02:49:18.960
You lived in West Hollywood forever,
Dude.
I don't know how you did it.

2970
02:49:19.020 --> 02:49:23.090

Yeah.
I thinks lasers are Nazis coming together.
Five minutes.

2981
02:50:07.860 --> 02:50:10.470
I'm desperate for new customers.
Mention the podcast,

2982
02:50:10.710 --> 02:50:14.490
signed a six month contract and get the first two months free so you only have

2983
02:50:14.491 --> 02:50:16.920
to pay for four months.
You get two months of free Jujitsu,

2984
02:50:16.980 --> 02:50:21.480
enjoy the shit out of it.
And uh,
listen,
there's a beginner classes,

2985
02:50:21.481 --> 02:50:22.171
you don't have to worry.

2986
02:50:22.171 --> 02:50:24.870
You're going to be doing it with people that are just starting out just like
you.

2987
02:50:25.290 --> 02:50:26.340
And it's really fun.

2988
02:50:26.341 --> 02:50:30.210
It's way more fun than just any other kind of regular exercise because you're

2989
02:50:30.211 --> 02:50:34.740
doing something,
it's like,
it's exciting.
I look forward to playing a video game,

2990
02:50:34.741 --> 02:50:38.120
but a virtual reality video game.
You are practicing killing techniques he has.

2991
02:50:38.190 --> 02:50:41.250
No one gets hurt.
No one's striking.
You're just practicing choking each other.

2992
02:50:41.251 --> 02:50:45.360
You know,
everybody in there,
we're all bros.
It's like it's,
it's,
yeah,

2993
02:50:45.361 --> 02:50:48.860
we tap each other out and then we're cool.
Yeah,
it happens all the time.
Got Hurt.

2994
02:50:48.900 --> 02:50:51.090
It's,
it's a great power to have.

2995
02:50:51.091 --> 02:50:56.091
It's a great skill to have the skill to get subdue people and put them asleep or

2996
02:50:59.611 --> 02:51:04.560
to,
you know,
run drum,
you know,
cripple for a temporary temporarily.

2997
02:51:04.561 --> 02:51:07.320
At least it's,
it's a great skill,
but have it so much fun.

2998
02:51:07.590 --> 02:51:11.180
We got beginner classes.
You don't have to be super smart or anything.

2999
02:51:11.210 --> 02:51:15.570
We have total retards that kids do it.
Old Ladies do it.

3000
02:51:15.571 --> 02:51:18.600
It's so much fun.
You gotta work out.
Everyone has to work out.

3001
02:51:18.720 --> 02:51:21.720
You might as well do something that's Super Fun,
Super Fun.

3002
02:51:21.721 --> 02:51:23.880
And it's a good skill to have.
You know,

3003
02:51:23.881 --> 02:51:27.150
if you had to choose between his riding a fucking elliptical machine every day

3004
02:51:27.151 --> 02:51:29.500
and lifting weights every now and then,
that's going to get boring.
Yeah.

3005
02:51:29.670 --> 02:51:33.720
This is like a skill.
It's a skill,
a life skill that can really help you.

3006
02:51:33.720 --> 02:51:37.080
If someone's fucking with you,
something happens.
They could save your life.

3007
02:51:37.530 --> 02:51:39.390
You know,
you're getting addicted to video games.

3008
02:51:39.480 --> 02:51:42.540
There's not going to save your life.
Playing Golf isn't going to save your life.

3009
02:51:42.690 --> 02:51:44.700
Lifting weights can help and saving your life,

3010
02:51:44.701 --> 02:51:49.170
but Jujitsu that really can save your life.
You and I both,

3011
02:51:49.260 --> 02:51:53.220
when we lift weights,
we lift weights just to get stronger at Jujitsu.
You know,

3012
02:51:53.221 --> 02:51:56.490
there's guys who live weights to look good and do like bicep curls,

3013
02:51:56.491 --> 02:51:59.390
like they work on certain specific things to look good.
I don't,

3014
02:51:59.580 --> 02:52:03.000
I don't do anything that doesn't help Jujitsu.
That's all I need to do.

3015
02:52:03.210 --> 02:52:06.130
And when you do that too,
I mean it all falls

3016
02:52:06.130 --> 02:52:07.670
<v 1>into place,
you know,
and then you,</v>

3017
02:52:07.671 --> 02:52:12.120
you start using your body as one unit two instead of like the bodybuilding style

3018
02:52:12.121 --> 02:52:15.130
of isolating things.
I don't hardly isolate anything anymore.

3019
02:52:15.131 --> 02:52:18.800
Every workout I do is like big cleans and you know,
and,

3020
02:52:18.801 --> 02:52:22.960
and squats and Kettlebell routines and shit.
Everything uses the whole body.

3021
02:52:22.961 --> 02:52:24.790
And the only reason why I do it is to get better at Jujitsu.

3022
02:52:24.860 --> 02:52:25.491
<v 4>Yeah.
Well that's,</v>

3023
02:52:25.491 --> 02:52:30.491
that's where we met 97 at John Jacques Machado Academy and a in the valley doing

3024
02:52:31.370 --> 02:52:33.890
Jujitsu.
And you know,
we had that one thing in common.

3025
02:52:33.891 --> 02:52:38.390
We're both obsessed with learning how to put people to sleep.

3026
02:52:38.780 --> 02:52:39.613
It's so much fun.

3027
02:52:39.630 --> 02:52:41.760
<v 1>Yeah.
Martial arts,
man.
I just,
uh,</v>

3028
02:52:41.790 --> 02:52:45.900
I think every young man should learn martial arts and not just to be a fighter,

3029
02:52:46.020 --> 02:52:48.030
to learn about yourself,
you know,
just to,

3030
02:52:48.031 --> 02:52:51.750
to push yourself to put yourself into difficult situations where you're nervous

3031
02:52:51.751 --> 02:52:55.710
and to overcome it and to learn from failure and you know,

3032
02:52:55.860 --> 02:52:58.380
so important man for development of your character.

3033
02:52:58.590 --> 02:53:02.990
So important for shaping your worldview and relaxing you as a person.
You know,

3034
02:53:02.991 --> 02:53:04.350
it's not what everybody thinks it is,
man.

3035
02:53:04.351 --> 02:53:07.650
It's not like a bunch of people trying to be bad asses.
It's not,
it's not at all.

3036
02:53:07.651 --> 02:53:09.390
It's not.
It's really cool people.

3037
02:53:09.750 --> 02:53:13.770
Some of my favorite human beings are my friends from martial arts,

3038
02:53:14.040 --> 02:53:16.320
guys that are trained with,
you know,
some of my favorite human beings,

3039
02:53:16.321 --> 02:53:17.910
some of the most relaxed people I know.

3040
02:53:18.120 --> 02:53:22.430
Some of the easiest going have the ego under control,
just super kind,

3041
02:53:22.650 --> 02:53:26.400
friendly people.
