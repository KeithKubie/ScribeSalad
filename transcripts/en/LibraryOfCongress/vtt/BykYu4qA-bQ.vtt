00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.620
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.920
&gt;&gt; Paul Ford: Hi.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.220
Welcome back from lunch.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.520
It's good to see everyone.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.600
This is a nice crowd for me.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.140
This is like -- this
feels like home.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.960
Just good data nerds everywhere.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.260
Oh, let's see.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.680
I'm going to start
with a short reading.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.570
It's about two minutes long.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.370
You're going to wonder why
the hell I'm doing this,

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.260
and later it will become clear.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.880
It is the raccoon history of New
York City from the perspective

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.760 position:56%
of a disgruntled [inaudible] raccoon
based on New York Times searchers.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.960
We have been here longer
-- I'm a raccoon.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.800
We have been here longer
than you have.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.350
We dipped our paws in the
spring on Spring Street.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.480
We climbed the trees in the
forest of lower Manhattan.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.650
We laughed in the moonlight
and ate beautiful dinners

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.880
of blackberries and lady bugs.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.960
And you came and you
stayed and you built houses.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.860
Fine. We're small.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.020
We will make room.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.320
You made muffins.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.620
We ate the crumbs.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.450
Everyone was happy.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.460
But not for long because
you wanted coats.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.620
So we went into exile upstate.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.460
For hundreds of years we kept
to ourselves, sneaking garbage

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.940
at night, the occasional bed
of lettuce or baked beans

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.650
or on a good night baked goods.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.230
Our fur was always in style,
and it was a hard life.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.490
But we lived on our love and our
wits, and then in the 1970's,

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.120
there was a fur boom, and I was
sure that was the end of us.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.780
But thank God, finally,
finally, we went out of fashion.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.850
And people began to realize

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.810
that we the raccoons
had a right to be there.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.150
They stood up for us.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:51.860
In 1982, a woman named -- in 1982,
a meaning was held in Scarsdale.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.910
Have we no decency in this town?

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.100
Asked a lady named Rita.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.020
Raccoons are bright,
lovable creatures.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.740
Do we want our children to
walk by their carcasses?

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.730
No, Rita, we don't.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.650
Do you see what was happening?

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.360
We weren't just getting
into your garbage.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.790
We were getting into your hearts.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.380
Word on rabies.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.370
Now, listen, I'm first to admit

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.070
that rabies is a problem
in our community.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.620
Let me tell you a story.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.280
It was 1998 in Woodstock, New York.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.330 position:56%
Lots of places sell baked goods
there, great town, very open-minded.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.860
And we thought we could
trust the humans.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.200
So this one raccoon, a little
guy, had a good thing going

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.970
with a woman named Barbara.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.270
She gave him treats.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.130
It was a backyard thing,
and you know how this goes.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.590
But it wasn't enough for Barbara.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.240
One day she trapped
him and took him.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.610
It's tough to talk about this.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.820
Took him to the local daycare

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.210
where she introduced this tiny
little raccoon to all the children,

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.390
and the raccoon cuddled with
everyone, 14 toddlers, ten adults.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.980
Beautiful, right?

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.110
But when it turned out that
all 24 humans had been exposed

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.810
to rabies, who was blamed?

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.260
Not Barbara.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.090
Who was shot in cold blood and
buried by Barbara's husband?

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.490
Not Barbara.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.050
Who had his little body dug up
by the Department of Health?

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.350
Not Barbara.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.650
Let me tell you.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.920
The name they gave that
raccoon, are you ready?

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:27.850
The name the humans gave that
raccoon in 1998 was Spartacus.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.500
That's the truth.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.000
The leader of the slave revolt.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.530
You can read it on the
article in the paper of record.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.010
Who's to blame here?

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.200
The raccoon doing its best or the
society that only accepts cuteness?

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.550
Now look, we always wanted
to come back to the city.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:44.850
This is our home.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.210
In 1984, a single raccoon
sighting in midtown was enough

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.040
to make the New York Times.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.340
Let me ask you.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.750
If you don't want raccoons,

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.770
why would you build an ornamental
gold fish pond on 51st Street?

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.730
By 2002, we'd made it
to the Bronx for real,

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.080
and over the last 15
years, we found our way back

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.650
to the city to all the burrows.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.630 position:56%
Today you'll find us everywhere, and
we've actually taken over Brooklyn.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:12.930
We've returned.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.050
Our trees and streams are gone, but
we make the best of what's there.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.310
And you call this [inaudible]
is doubly insulting.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.490
Let me take the second word first.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.490
Panda is overrated.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.700
Their ecological niche
is five inches wide,

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.020
and if you don't serve them
fresh bamboo prepared just

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.340
so they fall over and die.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.440
Imagine a panda finding its
way down the FDR to midtown.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.460
But also that first word, trash.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.910
Let me ask is it so wrong that
we want what you throw away,

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.590
your spare [inaudible] dollops,
your blue sky bakery muffin chunks?

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.260
I live from your [inaudible]
leavings.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.300
Your trash is my gold.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.710
Why not treasure Panda?

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.460 position:56%
And remember, we're not your guests.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.590
You are the guests of the raccoons.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.790
So the reason for that will
become clear momentarily.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.350
We got through the raccoon
portion of the talk.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.460
And now I'm going to
make some observations

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.410
about a life spent lived
between media and archives

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.430
and then do a very brief
software demo like a minute.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.010
And then issue some recommendations
to the assembled audience

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.720
because it's not often that
I get you all here together,

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.060
and I'm kind of excited to tell you
what I need and ask for your help.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.450
So in 2006, 2005, I was a
writer, and I was doing okay,

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.190 position:56%
and I got a job at Harpers
Magazine in charge of their website.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.070
I was also kind of a programmer,
just one of those people

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.660
who did a couple of different
things kind of poorly.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.900
And Harpers being cheap was
like, "Well, this will do."

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.200
And brought me on.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.680
And I'll get -- a good
example of what it was

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.050 position:56%
like to work there was the publisher
took me aside, and I was like,

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.350 position:56%
"I think we should put some articles
from the magazine on the internet,"

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.520
and his response was, "You're
like McNamara getting me further

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.090
into the Vietnam of
the world wide web,"

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.490 position:56%
which literally tells you everything
you need to know, and so after --

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.880
there wasn't any Wikipedia,

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.690
so I just had to make
due with that analogy.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:22.250
And -- but given no money, given
lots of time, and given sort

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:27.300 position:56%
of the resources at hand, I realized
this magazine had gone back to 1850,

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.420
and also there was this sort

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.390
of white elephant bibliography
that they built.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.990
They built it during the days
when they were going to make it

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.970
and then sell terminals to research
libraries for tens of thousands

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.550
of dollars a year so that
people could walk to the stacks

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.820
and go get the magazines off
the stacks going back to 1850,

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.040
and everything was
beautiful and started

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.370
with [inaudible] subject
headings and on and on.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.930 position:56%
And, of course, it had gone terribly
over schedule and so they started

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.570 position:56%
in '89 or '90 and now it was '95 and
nobody -- everybody wanted pictures.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.580
So now ten years later, I show up
and I'm like, this thing's great.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.070
Let's put some pictures with it.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:05.370
And they said, "Great.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.360
We'll give you 18 grand, and
that includes your scanner."

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.000
So I bought -- I did
some experiments.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.590
I bought a Fujitsu 5750C,

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.900
and I scanned the hell
out of that archive.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:25.010 position:56%
Making of America had gone 1850 to
1900 out of Cornell and other places

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:29.230
so I traded them a hard drive
with Harpers up to 1923,

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.980
up to the public domain line and
gave them some bibliographic data.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.330
They gave me -- it was just this
insane horse trading with no money

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.760
in which I was doing
all the programming,

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.770
all the scanning or
most of the scanning.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.600
I had a high school
student who was terrible.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.870
Actually, I should
have done all of it.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.530
And -- in the 70's, there's like
all these little [inaudible] cut

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.470
from the spine because he
wasn't paying attention.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:56.870
Anyway, got it down to like
seven cents a page, put it up

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.320
and then suddenly everybody
was really nice to me.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.290
And they had been yelling
at me before.

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.120
I was a cost center.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.010
But it turns out is that it's
very expensive to get someone

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.360
to subscribe to a magazine,
often 20, 30, up to 100 bucks

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.450
to get somebody to
subscribe to a magazine

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.140
that they might pay $20 for.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.860
And the reason that it's
worth it to pay that is

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.900
because advertising is what
really funds the publication.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.980 position:56%
And so what I had done all of a
sudden, all these subscriptions came

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.880
in because people like archives.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.470
They don't like them -- they
like subscribing but the idea

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.690
of getting everything back
to 1850 was very motivating.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.550
And so suddenly instead of
having to spend 35 bucks,

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:38.080
we were getting these
digital subscribers

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.520
who were just showing up.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.300
And they were really nice to
me for a couple of months.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.360
They were really happy I was there
because I wasn't making the money

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.160
with the archive, but
I was saving the money.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.810
And the reason you need to
keep your circulation up is

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.650
that advertisers buy by number, and
it's audited so it's like if you're

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.910
at a quarter million, you have to
spend all the money in the world

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.850
to keep at a quarter million or
your whole business model implodes.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:06.700
So that's one big interaction
between archives and the media

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.000
that I can share with you.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.410
Also, the whole time I was ashamed
because I would go to the Library

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.690
of Congress website and other sites
which had standards for scanning,

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:18.890
and it would be like only 96 bit
uncompressed [inaudible] were

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.770
acceptable ever.

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:25.650
I had one -- a couple hard drives
and no money, and I was like --

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.950
I just made a decision
that if I can see the grain

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:31.400
of the paper, that that was okay.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.720
But no one backed me up on that.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.700
And so I built this archive that
was good that ended up being resold

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.050
to lots of university libraries.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:40.760
It was fine, but the
whole time I did it I was

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.890
like I don't know what the
right angle of pages is,

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:47.880 position:56%
and I don't know what the tolerances
truly are because with the standards

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.220
that are published
are incredibly high.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.090 position:56%
They're just -- they're not intended
for amateurs with no budgets,

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:57.180
but that was the real world I
was in to get this asset online.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.060
Also, I scored a whole copy of
the archive from Bennington.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:04.820
Somebody drove down from Vermont
and Toyota and just gave me all

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.780
of Harpers because they
wanted digital access.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.300
So that's how that got done, right?

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:13.320
It's a completely no
grant, no process,

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.400
no good standards, no
clear understanding.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.350
And yet it got done.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.840
Also, once I got it out there,
people immediately came in

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.200
and started to threaten lawsuits.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.570
The number one job of an editor
is not to make things beautiful

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:27.870
or to make the prose great.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.920
It's to avoid litigation.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:35.240
Putting all these things online
meant that people who had forgotten

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.560
about that unfortunate incident
in 1995 suddenly were back

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.200
and were angry that it had found
its way onto the web again.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.050
So just something worth noting.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:48.350
My microphone is falling off
so we'll see how it goes.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:52.300
And then I left there, worked
for a big consulting --

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.580
or small media consulting
firm that gave me lots

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:59.260
of access to big media companies.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:03.210
I built a version of Gourmet
Magazine for the iPad,

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:08.640
which many things aside, it was
based on archives from Gourmet.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.420
And I learned -- I think it was
very important that I will continue

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.800
to talk about which is asset panic.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.890
Unless you have the
assets in your hand

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:19.300
and you can't believe how many
people tell you no worries.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.240
I'm going to go get you a hard
drive with all that stuff.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.540
Don't worry.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:23.970
Fine. And like four months goes by,

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.980
they're like actually there's
12 lawyers involved now.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.420
I don't know how the
hell it happened.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.870
Both things increase risk
in an organization and API's

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.250
and archives are territories.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:38.200
People are very fiercely
dependent, defendant around them

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.870
and so I learned to
navigate and deal with that.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.380
That's another reality
in this world.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.910
So that's my advice to
anyone if you ever end

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.330
up in the private sector
working on archives, panic.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.320
Just constantly frequently
never stop panicking

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.830
until you have full control over
all the assets and have them

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:57.780
in the digital form
that you can manipulate.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.870
Then as mentioned in my
intro very graciously,

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:04.200
I wrote this thing a couple of
years ago called what is code

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.230
for Bloomberg Business Week,
and they basically said, here,

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:08.190
take the whole issue
of the magazine.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:12.610
And I write about code, do anything
you want, go crazy, have fun.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:13.910
And it was terrifying.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:16.020
They were literally like hey, we're
going to give you the whole issue,

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.640
and I went and hid under a
blanket, and my wife laughed at me,

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.930
and I moaned because I knew that
everyone was going to yell at me.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:24.230
There's no way you'd
do something like this

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.270
and programmers don't
come scream at you.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:29.850
But the key thing is
that we talk about this,

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:32.320
and we talk about me,
the writer, I did it.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:36.040
A hundred people worked on this
at least, and even more so --

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.510 position:56%
I want to come back to this point --

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:41.230
but there was a [inaudible]
repository.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.160
So after it was published,
it went out

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.590
and people continued to correct it.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:48.130
So probably 200 people had
their hands on this thing,

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.170
and all of it -- some of their
work is tracked, some of it isn't.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.090
But what we just do
culturally is just like, oh,

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.720
Paul Ford wrote this thing,
which is great for me.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.020
I love it.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.360
Seriously, like it's fantastic.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.540
My ego is constantly gratified.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.480
But it's gratified based on lies.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.460
So I live with it.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.160
I live with it, and I do okay.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.980
But the writing process
is stochastic.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.740 position:56%
It's not this nice, clear delineated
thing where there's versions and --

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.750
it's just crap flying everywhere,
and everyone's putting stuff off

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.900
until the last minute and nobody
knows what the hell is going on.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.560
Last little stage of my life, I
decided I would start a business

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.910 position:56%
with my -- with the cofounder, a
guy named Rich Ziotti, and it was --

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:30.450
we're building just --
we're digital products.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:33.230
We build apps and websites
in New York City,

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:35.040
and I was like, "This is it.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.340
Done with archives for awhile,

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:37.730
probably done with
the cultural sector.

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:40.210
Let's make a little money
and go work for banks."

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:41.660
But they find you.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.310
You can't get away.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.490
Archives can't be escaped.

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.470
I can't even talk about
half the work.

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:49.070
A big NGO came.

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:52.140
I ended up -- I'm like on the phone
for an hour and a half talking

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.420
with Nara, and Nara
loves conference calls.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:59.690
I don't know if you've ever
had that experience, but whew.

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:03.920
So a lot of conference calls, a
lot of like what asset goes here

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.490
and what asset goes there.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:11.020
And so no matter what you
do, you deal with archives.

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.750
And what I realized is that
all our software problems,

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.230
kind of our legacy
problems and archive is kind

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.090
of a nice way to say legacy.

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:20.790
The cultural sector dealing with
big archives is actually not

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:24.450
that different from
going to some company,

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:27.510
and they have five terabytes
of information and user records

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.000
and all kinds of things that
they need to make sense of.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.510
So in some ways there, the
problems base is kind of similar.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:39.600
So I'm going to do a quick
software demo as I now try

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.790
to take everything I just
told you and synthesize it.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:45.090
A couple of more things to know.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:46.390
I mean, I love timelines.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.690
Timelines are great.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:48.990
They're beautiful.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.600
Many of the speakers have
talked about timelines.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.170
I'm going to tell you
something about timelines.

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:53.470
This one's great.

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:55.710
Oh yeah, that one's from
the Washington Post.

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:59.570
This is -- where we go --

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:03.120
oh boy, everything's gone
-- nothing's going my way.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.460
I'm going to go backwards .

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.760
There we go.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.790
So timelines are great.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:09.610
Timelines are terrible
interfaces by the way.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:10.910
There we go.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.210
This is all humanity.

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:14.560
Timelines always seem like a
good idea, and I'm not like five

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.650
or six years in and built a bunch.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:19.920
They never actually solve a
problem, but they look cool.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.610
Sometimes they kind of do.

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:22.910
It hurts, it really stings.

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:26.790
I want to believe in timelines
so bad, so bad, but I can't.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:29.960
[Inaudible] three years
late on a book.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.330 position:56%
This is kind of the confession part.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.090
I just want to share this with
you because why would a guy

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:37.990
who has a software company and is
a writer go and build software?

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:41.520
Because it's because he
doesn't want to write something.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.690
These are all the things
I've done to avoid the book.

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:48.570
I agreed to give this talk, that's
one, create experimental websites,

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:49.990
learn two new computer languages,

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.220
rented an office, a
lot of coffee stuff.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.610
I got into coffee,
got out of coffee,

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:57.280
got some cushions,
some nice cushions.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.070
I bought a whiteboard.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:02.370
I wrote software to manage my
anxiety about writing the book.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:03.740
I wrote that business week piece.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.500
That's actually kind of what's
supposed to be from the book

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:06.940
but then I did that instead.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:10.140
A lot of medium posts,
cofounded a company.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.760 position:56%
But there's one in here I wrote,
and then abandoned this book writing

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.100
because when you're
supposed to write a book,

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.830
the first thing you do is
write a CMS to manage the book.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:21.590
So I did this like
three or four years ago.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:25.730 position:56%
I wrote the CMS, and I kind of got
30, 40, 50 percent of the way there,

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.030
and I was like eh, and
then I gave up on that.

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:29.330
So I had like two things.

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:30.640
[Inaudible] procrastination.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.880
It's actually really interesting
because then you're like do I have

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:38.860
to -- do I just stop and finish the
book or should I back out from --

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:42.840
I'm like now so far in
so I clean the office

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.410
and then finish the CMS
and then write the book.

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:54.380
So it turns out I remained
blocked, and I'm still blocked.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.050
I'm still kind of working
through that.

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:58.020
There's a third thing that
goes into the software demo

00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.970
which is the media is
having a really bad time.

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.930
Nobody trusts it.

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:07.380
It's -- 72 percent of people kind
of trust national news org --

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.650
but only 20 percent trust it a lot.

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:11.970 position:56%
I mean, you saw Rachel here earlier.

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:13.270
She's working hard.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:15.060
She's getting a lot of
statistics all lined up and working

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.810
with journalists to try
to get things as factual

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:18.530
as possible for the New York Times.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.110
The people who work in that
field are very disciplined

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:25.060
and very serious, and it sucks
but the world doesn't trust them.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.410
It's sad and it's tough
and it's bad marketing,

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:32.710
and it's bad politics,
and it's a situation.

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:37.650
And then also -- sorry to go
back to The Times, but editors

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:41.160
and copywriters and fact checkers
are getting laid off everywhere.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.550
That's just a reality.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:45.040
It's been reality for
five, ten years now.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.030
There's just less and less money
for them, less and less money

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:51.110
for content production
and so they're going

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:54.680
and then there's a huge discussion
around fake news, and that is --

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.030
I'm not going to recapitulate.

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:57.580
You're all living it.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:01.660
But there's this sense
of news being arbitrary

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:05.450
and journalism being arbitrary.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:10.960 position:56%
And writers, in my opinion, are
learning less and less good practice

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.570
because they have fewer and fewer
people to keep an eye on them.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:18.320
And so my solution to this was

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:24.150
to build a timeline
for which I apologize.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.930
And it has all the
regular timeline things.

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:29.630
You give it events and the
events have dates stamped on them

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:32.230
and it arranges them and
then here's a little video

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:34.000
of those things moving around.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.560
And you can click on the date and
zoom out and see different contexts

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:43.250
and this is all powered by an API
with a nice Java script front end.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:45.480
I knew as I was doing this that
timelines aren't the answer,

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.780
but I couldn't help myself.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:50.010
These are all events from
Wikipedia, events from all over.

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:53.720
And all kinds of different sources.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:59.070
And so I've gone out to the
1800's and zoomed back in

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:03.860
and then underneath all that,
what you can do is just sort

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:07.480
of bookmark the event and they
kind of go into this pile of stuff

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.480
on the right and then you
add notes to the bookmarks,

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.320
and that turns into an essay.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:18.880
So what's nice about that is you're
keeping your sources connected

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.840
to the things that you're
writing and then you can kind

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.030
of rearrange these
little blocks of text.

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:25.190
It looks like it might
be easy or not easy.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:27.050
It's actually kind of
a great way to write.

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:29.000
If you are like me and
you're getting older

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.240
and you don't trust your memory
as much and you can't count

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.270
on fact checkers in the
way that you're used to,

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:40.300
it keeps everything you do
connected to what you're writing.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.750
And so some of those
cultural problems

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:45.590
that are emerging are
very much on my mind.

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:47.120
And I feel that a lot
of the software --

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.780
we built CMS's at my company.

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:52.780
I built more CMS's than I'd
like to admit in my life.

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:56.210
You give people a text
box, and then you move on.

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:58.760
And I feel that the text
boxes need to get smarter.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.310
They need to do more work.

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:04.990
And so here's an example of
how I wrote that raccoon piece.

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:09.890
I imported a ton of New York
Times and other search results,

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:11.190
some of the Cooper
Hewitt Collection,

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:12.490
which actually didn't have a lot

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:15.500
of raccoon based information
but still was cool.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:19.360 position:56%
Search for raccoon and it made a
timeline as a result, looked around,

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.110
read some raccoon articles
and then started

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:26.240
to write factually based
slightly funny raccoon prose.

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.020
Okay, so that piece exists
because I built my system,

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.320
and I wanted to test it out.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.770
So that's just something
to think about.

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:34.550
There's some continuity there.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:38.620
So anyway, [inaudible].

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:42.610
Here's what I have really learned
from building that and doing that.

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:45.150
I want to get to about a terabyte
of metadata in that thing.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:49.030
It's probably like 50,
100 megabytes right now.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:52.190
There's a lot of -- maybe a
little more if you count images.

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:56.920
And I want to get as much
cultural information in as events

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.760
as I possibly can over
the next say year or so.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.100
I want to be clear, what I showed
you, it's a personal side project.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.400
I built that thing.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.700
I'm using it to write.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:09.200
It actually has really helped
unblock me on the book.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:13.800
And because it turns out it's a
great quote from Joyce Carroll

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.930
that said, "Writer's block is
related to the writer's sense

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:20.540
of their own fraudulence."

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.410
And what this does is it keeps
you from feeling like a fraud.

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:26.400
You're like all right,
there's an event.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.700
I wrote a little note about it.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.000
I wrote another note.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.300
And suddenly you're
writing an essay,

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.850
and that is actually very good at
taking away the block that you get

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:34.920
when you have a pile
of books on one side

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.970
and a blank screen on the other.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:40.910
So this is what the world
looks like a little bit

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:45.660
around cultural archives that
are open and can be imported.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.840
You've got -- I won't even explain
this chart because you all live it.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.540
But I've been through all of it.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.840
I love XML.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.140
I love XSLT.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.440
I love RDF.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.740
I love CSV.

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.040
I love UTF8 data.

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:02.480
I don't love web services and
so -- but I'm mixed on mets.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.000
But there's [inaudible].

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.390
This is how stuff comes out.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:10.980
This is what you get today,
and it's really freaking hard

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.320
to work with, all of it.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.940
And I've worked with all of it, and
I'm good at working with all of it.

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.640
I'm like 20 years in.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:21.620
I photocopied the SGML ISO
standard at a college library

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:25.270 position:56%
after getting it through [inaudible]
all 900 pages of it because I saw it

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:28.930
as wonderful secret lure when
I was 20 years old, which is --

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:35.930
that doesn't leave the
room, but really --

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:39.820
but I mean, I love this stuff,

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.280
but it's also just kind
of increasingly hard.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.860
It's intractable to work with when
you're trying to really explore

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:50.350 position:56%
and understand the data set or
import it in bulk into another view.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:53.720
And so I've been -- I'll talk
through some of the ones I looked

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.930
at -- Cooper Hewitt, amazing,

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:58.030
[inaudible] links to
images, fantastic.

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:00.900
Actually kind of hard because it's
zillions of files, very hard --

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:04.950
you have to import it somewhere
and then search through it.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:09.150
Met, giant CSV file,
hard to work with.

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.250
Doesn't directly link to images.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:14.470
It has a sort of interstitial ID.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:16.920
It's so -- but I need pictures.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.220
I love pictures.

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:21.160 position:56%
Everyone who works in media needs
pictures to make their thing useful.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.820
My timeline kind of sucks
and isn't exciting for me

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.120
to use unless it has pictures.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.650
So then am I spidering
every webpage in order

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:29.410
to figure out what the image is?

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:30.710
All that sort of stuff comes

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:33.530
up because the CSV
doesn't include images.

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:35.980
This is me by the way
criticizing the comments,

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.280
just me saying hey thanks

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.130
for all the incredible things
you've given me for free

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:40.430
and you're really hard work.

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:41.960
Let me tell you why I hate it.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.340
I'm mindful of that.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.210
The stuff is a gift.

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.850
This API is again wonderful
and terrible.

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:54.220
Kind of great to work with,
slow just doesn't always --

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.990
it's hard to know where you are.

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:59.490
This thing is horrible.

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:02.690
When you get into the
XML in this bad boy,

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:06.010
it is just an endless nightmare of
pain, and there's no way around it.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:08.850
Wikipedia is hard to
work with the raw data.

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:10.150
There's [inaudible].

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:12.690
There's all these other -- I mean,
there's so many projects to deal

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:15.370
with the fact that Wikipedia
data is tough to work

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:18.870
with that I can't even listen.

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:23.600
25 million mark records,
which thanks and also thanks.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:29.390
Right? They're great, and I
started messing around with them.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:30.690
I got [inaudible].

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:32.220
I started fooling around and
doing everything I could,

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.120
but they're hard to work with.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.780
They're from a specific world.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.080
Gorgeous API.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.470
[Inaudible] actually has one of the
nicest designed comment driving,

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.380
public API's I've ever seen.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.200
Hierarchy is incredibly clear.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.860
I want to spider the
whole damn thing

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:51.700
and just know everything that's in
there, and there's no simple way

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:55.140
to do that aside from writing
a web spider and then sort

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:56.940
of mapping it to my schema.

00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:01.520
And so I think there's this tension
going on between archive and access

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.510
with how things are
actually working,

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:05.190
and I think that we've cut things

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:08.550
up like right now I think the
consensus is a great open API

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:09.970
is enough.

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:12.280
For God's sake, it is,
it's a wonderful thing.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.850
But I'm going to mention something
that we don't like to talk

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:19.030
about very much in our community
which is relational databases

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:21.130
in SQL, which are everywhere.

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:24.640
This is the data language
of the universe.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.590
This is how people store

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:29.180
and retrieve data is
through SQL databases.

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:35.100
And this little guy, SQLite
is entirely public domain.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:36.400
It's on all of your phones.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.700
It's on Android.

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.140
It's on IOS.

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.030
It's built in everywhere.

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:43.150
It comes as part of Python.

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:48.940 position:56%
It is 150K SQL database that kind of
runs the world and it's so powerful

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:54.010
and unassuming that nobody
really talks about it.

00:25:54.010 --> 00:26:00.490 position:56%
But if you could start putting all
of your data into SQL Lite databases

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:03.860
and making those available,
then I could download them,

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:07.460
and I could start searching
and exploring it without having

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:10.910
to put it anywhere in five seconds.

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:15.330
I could start hacking and
messing with public [inaudible]

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:18.080
in the time it took to
download because once you get in

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.170
and you type SQL Lite
database, you're good to go.

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:24.760
You can even turn on full
text search, public domain,

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:29.010
[inaudible] UTF8 or
UTF16 by default, etc.,

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:32.030
etc. It actually hits all the sweet
spots that we usually talk about.

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:33.430
It just doesn't talk
about them in the way

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:36.620
that we usually talk about them.

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.730
Also, if you could
make them torrentable,

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:41.060
my God that would be great.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.080
I know that may be really
hard for an organization,

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.880
a large cultural organization.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.500
You could just take
your SQL Lite file --

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.890
and by the way, I'm not
saying get rid of your API.

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:51.640
I'm not saying get
rid of your CSV's.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:56.210 position:56%
I'm just saying do this other thing,
too, or suggest to someone else even

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:58.230
like me to go and do it for you.

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:01.920
If you point to the thing, if you
say like, "Hey, we didn't do this,"

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.460
but if you want to
torrent everything

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.240
as a SQL Lite database,
go it's over here.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.540
That's fantastic.

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:12.410
A little bit of institutional
[inaudible] to say that's

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:15.790
at least semiofficial is a
really, really powerful signal.

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:17.440
I can't tell you enough
because there's all these --

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.210
Wikipedia is a great example.

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:22.860
There's eight million extracting
data from Wikipedia projects.

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:25.830
None of them are particularly
blessed.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:28.040
I guess there's like semantic
media [inaudible] and a few others

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.250
that have more involvement
with the foundation.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:31.910
But you just don't
know where to start.

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:36.430
If I could just get this, if I
can click download the torrent,

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:40.600
I will start messing with and
incorporating your corporate

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:45.450
into my historical writing tool
within hours, and I will make sure

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:49.070
that every single one of those
boxes has a clear link back

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:51.200
for accreditation back
to your organization.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.870
I will absolutely want to do that.

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:57.060
If you give me an API or a CSV,

00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:02.300
you've added sometimes months
of work to that process.

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:04.640
So again, supplement, not replace.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.340
I'm not asking people to replace
what they are with this formula,

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.330
but some sort of comments were met

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:13.530
that I could immediately start
manipulating would be fantastic.

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:16.350
Leave the original record,
even put it into SQL Lite.

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:18.400
You don't have to throw
away to the past.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.030
I know that's really
hard to do culturally

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:22.730
to throw away old records.

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:25.530
Don't. Just leave them there.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:26.830
Assume storage is free.

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:28.130
Assume bandwidth is free.

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:31.110 position:56%
I can download -- I have a ten
terabyte drive at home to work with.

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:34.930
I spent like $1000 on a
really, really powerful machine.

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:37.950
And I have very fast internet, and
that's just me at home in Brooklyn.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:40.870
It's not -- that's the entirety

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:43.440
of money invested into
[inaudible] so far.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.340
And also images.

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.710
Anything you can do to be
visual with your corporate --

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:50.730
it makes it easier for
me to hack with, explore

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:52.250
and put them into other context.

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:55.430
It's such a powerful signal.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:57.990
And again yeah, if you
can't do, just point,

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:00.650 position:56%
just say like hey, this looks legit.

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:03.490
We're happy that they
put in this SQL Lite.

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:05.560
Good job. Because I know that
culturally it can be hard

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.030
to do new things with your data.

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:11.750
So that's my big ask.

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:15.160
Going back to where we
were, I think there are sort

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.200
of two main fallacies of archives.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.050
The publishers believe they're free
content and that you can just sort

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:25.830
of use them over and over again
and find value in the past

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.370
that can be easily exposed.

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:30.340 position:56%
It can't, not without a lot of human
work to add context and meaning

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.700
which is what everyone who has been

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.710
up here today has essentially
emphasized.

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:39.350
It's an unbelievable amount of
labor to get value and meaning

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:41.160
and news out of archives.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:45.820
I tried to correct the publishers
on this, and they get really sad.

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:47.320
They're like, "We want
to build an archive

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.430
of our wonderful publication."

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:51.730
And I'm like, "Well, let me
tell you what that will take,"

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:54.400
and then like ten minutes later,
they ask me to leave the room.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.370
The archivist's fallacy
is a little bit

00:29:57.370 --> 00:29:59.160
that news is an archive
waiting to happen.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.460
That's not real either.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.290
There's all sorts of
things that are going

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:05.000
on around how media is produced.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.300
And so what I'm trying
to do here is just see

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.900
if software can help
resolve that gap

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:12.590
and the number one guinea pig
right now for me is me as a writer

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:18.990
and journalist, supposed to be
doing -- well, that's all right.

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:20.920
Supposed to be doing more work
for business week right now

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.860
and of course I'm procrastinating
on that, too.

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:26.320
But I am using the tool,
and it's very productive.

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:29.270
I'm going to try to
open it really soon.

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:31.250
I'm just a little nervous
about API security.

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:36.090
But -- and pretty soon I'll have
probably a couple million events

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:37.390
on it.

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:41.810
So -- but I think that there's an
opportunity for things like this,

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:43.180
and this is just a hypothesis.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:45.980
I don't -- this is not
[inaudible] this product.

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:48.330
This is something I really
wanted to see in the world,

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:51.940
and I wanted to resolve some
of my own anxiety about facts

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:55.460
and sort of what archives can do.

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:59.020
But I think there's -- just
watching the talks today,

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:03.200
there's been 20 different angles
on this exact same situation.

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:07.830
So -- but I could really
use the help in just sort

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:09.320
of easily importable data.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.920
I have lots of ideas for what
you can do with your date

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:16.320
and time fields including ones
that are 20 years old in mark

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.780
and have lots of [inaudible]
characters

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:19.160
in them and are pretty whacky.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.460
I totally can help you.

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:21.760
Just let me know.

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.060
I have a strategy.

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:26.840
So that's where I'm at, and I
just wanted to show that to you.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.640
Thank you all very much.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.240
