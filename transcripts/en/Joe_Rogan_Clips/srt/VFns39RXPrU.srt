1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,430
The Joe Rogan experience. Um,

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:08,560
are you aware at all of the current
state of surveillance and what,

3
00:00:08,561 --> 00:00:11,590
if anything has changed
since your revelations?

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,560
Yeah, I mean the, the big thing
that's changed, um, since I was,

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,600
uh, in, in, in, in 2013
is now it's mobile first.

6
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:27,370
Everything, um, mobile
was still a big deal,

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,350
right? Um, and the intelligence
community was very much grappling, uh,

8
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:35,770
to, to get its hands around
it and to deal with it. Um,

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,420
but now people are much less likely
to use laptop than use a desktop than,

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,740
than yours. You know, God,
any kind of wired phone. Um,

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,350
then they already use a smartphone. Uh,

12
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:51,730
and both Apple and Android
devices unfortunately, uh,

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,290
are not especially good in protecting
your privacy. You think right now,

14
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,840
um, you've got a smart phone, right?

15
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,700
You might be listening to this on a
train somewhere and in traffic right now.

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,320
Um, or are you Joe right now? You got a
phone somewhere in the room, right? Uh,

17
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,760
the phone is turned off for at
least the screen is turned off.

18
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,680
It's sitting there. It is powered on.
And if somebody sends you a message,

19
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,780
the screen Burl blinks to
life, how does that happen?

20
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,570
Right? Uh, how is it that if someone
from any corner of the earth, uh,

21
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,730
dials a number, your phone
rings and nobody else's rings,

22
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,670
how is it that you can dial anybody
else's number and only their phone rings?

23
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:40,290
Right? Uh, every smartphone,
every phone at all, uh,

24
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,240
is constantly connected, uh, to the
nearest cellular tower. Um, every phone,

25
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:47,850
even when the screen is off,
you think it's doing nothing.

26
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,750
You can't see it because radio
frequency emissions are invisible. Um,

27
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,040
it's screaming in the air
saying, here I am, here I am.

28
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,830
Here is my a IME. I think it's
a individual manufacturers,

29
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,890
equipment identity, uh, and
IME high, uh, individual, uh,

30
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,060
manufacturers, um, subscriber
identity. I could be wrong on the,

31
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:15,180
the breakout there, but the, the
acronyms are the IME I and the IMSI.

32
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,920
And you can search for these things.

33
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,220
There are two global unique identifiers
that only exist anywhere in the world,

34
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,210
uh, in one place. Right?

35
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,520
This makes your phone different
than all the other phones. Uh,

36
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,150
the IMEA is burned into
the handset of your phone,

37
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,230
no matter what SIM card you change
to, it's always going to be the same.

38
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:35,880
And it's always going to be
telling the phone network.

39
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:38,970
It's this physical handset. Then the IME,

40
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,950
SSI is in your SIM card. Right? And this
is what holds your phone number, right?

41
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,590
Is that basically the key, the
right to use that phone number.

42
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,110
And so your phone is sitting there
doing nothing, you think? Uh,

43
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:55,410
but it's constantly shouting and
saying, I'm here who is closest to me.

44
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,770
That's a cell phone tower and every
cell phone tower with its ears,

45
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,240
uh, is listening for these little
cries for help and going, Oh right,

46
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,110
I see Joe Rogan's phone.
Right? I see Jamie's phone,

47
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:11,170
I see all these phones
that are here right now.

48
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,480
And it compares notes,
uh, with the other, uh,

49
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:19,870
network towers and your smartphone
compares notes with them to go,

50
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,400
who do I hear the loudest
and who you hear, uh,

51
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:29,140
the loudest is a proxy for, uh,
proximity for closeness. Distance,

52
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:33,880
right. They go, whoever I hear more loudly
than anybody else that's close to me.

53
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,000
So you're going to be bound to this cell
phone tower and that cell phone tower

54
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,680
is going to make a note, a permanent
record, uh, saying this phone,

55
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:42,700
uh,

56
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,700
this phone handset with this phone
number at this time was connected to me.

57
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,500
Right? And based on your phone
handset and your phone number, uh,

58
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,110
they can get your identity right. Um,

59
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,720
because you pay for this stuff with your
credit card and everything like that.

60
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,540
Uh, and even if you don't, right,
it's still active at your house, uh,

61
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,520
overnight. It's still active, you know,
on your nightstand when you're sleeping,

62
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,470
it's still whatever, uh,

63
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,770
the movements of your phone or
the movements of you as a person.

64
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:16,270
And those are often, uh, quite uniquely
identifying. It goes to your home,

65
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:20,560
it goes to your workplace. Other
people don't have it, sorry. Um,

66
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,890
and a new way. It's
constantly shouting this out.

67
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:26,410
And then a compares notes with
the other, uh, parts and network.

68
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,390
And when somebody is trying to get to a
phone, it compares notes of the network,

69
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:32,290
compares notes to go,

70
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,240
where is this phone with this phone
number in the world right now?

71
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,200
And to that cell phone tower
that is closest to that phone,

72
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,290
it sends out a signal saying,
we have a call for you,

73
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,940
make your phone start ringing so your
owner can answer it and then it connects

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,780
it across this whole path.

75
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,740
But what this means is that
whenever you're carrying a phone,

76
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,160
whenever the phone is turned on,

77
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:59,290
there's a record of your presence at
that place that is being made and created

78
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:03,250
by companies. It does not need
to be kept forever. And in fact,

79
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,350
there's no good argument
for it to be kept forever.

80
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:08,500
But these companies see that
as valuable information, right?

81
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,190
This is the whole big data problem that
we're running into and all this, uh,

82
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,320
information that used
to be a femoral, right?

83
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,160
Where were you when you were eight
years old? You know, um, where were you?

84
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:20,920
Where'd you go after you
had a bad breakup? You know,

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,833
who did you spend the night with?

86
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,030
Who'd you call after all this
information used to be a femoral,

87
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,410
meaning it disappeared, right? Like,
like the morning Dew. It would be gone.

88
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,710
No one would remember it. But
now these things are stored.

89
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,340
Now these things are saved. It,

90
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,100
it doesn't matter whether
you're doing anything wrong,

91
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,070
it doesn't matter whether you even
most ordinary person on earth, uh,

92
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,640
because that's how bulk collection,

93
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,480
which is the government's euphemism
for mass surveillance works.

94
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,960
They simply collect it all in advance
in hopes that one day it will become

95
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:50,381
useful.

96
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:55,381
And that was just talking about how
you connect to the phone network.

97
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,620
That's not talking about all those apps
on your phone that are contacting the

98
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:04,070
network even more frequently. Right? Uh,

99
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,290
how do you get a text
message notification?

100
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,760
How do you get an email notification?

101
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,240
How is it the Facebook knows where
you're at? You know, all of these things,

102
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:13,700
these analytics, uh,

103
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,420
they are trying to keep track through
location services on your phone,

104
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,171
through GPS,

105
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:21,800
through even just what wireless access
points you're connected to because

106
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:24,260
there's a global constantly
updated map. There's actually,

107
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:27,860
many of them have wireless access
points in the world because just like we

108
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:30,890
talked about, every phone has a unique
identifier that's globally unique.

109
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,090
Every wireless access point in the world,
right? You cable modem at home, uh,

110
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,070
whether it's in your laptop,

111
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:42,071
every device that has a radio modem
has a globally unique identifier in it.

112
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,770
Um, and uh, this is standard
term. You can look it up. Uh,

113
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:51,230
and these things can be mapped when
they're broadcasting in the air because

114
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:55,700
again, like your phone says to the
cellphone tower, I have this identifier.

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,940
The cell phone tower responds
and says, I have this identifier.

116
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:02,390
And anybody who's listening, uh,
they can write these things down.

117
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,750
And all those Google street view
cars that go back and forth, right?

118
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:11,290
They're keeping notes on whose
wifi is active on this block,

119
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:15,500
right? And then they build a new giant
map. So even if you have GPS turned off,

120
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,540
right, uh, as long as you're connected
to wifi, uh, those apps can go,

121
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,970
well, I, I'm connected to Joe's wifi,

122
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,530
but I can also see his neighbor's wifi
here and the other one in this apartment

123
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,210
over here and the other
one in the apartment here.

124
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,720
And you should only be able to hear
those four globally unique wifi access

125
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:39,650
points from these points
in physical space. Right.

126
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:44,120
The intersection in between the
spreads, the domes of all those,

127
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,710
uh, wireless access points.

128
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,040
It's a proxy for location and
it just goes on and on and on.

129
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,470
We could talk about this for four more
hours. We don't have that kind of time.

130
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,370
Can I ask you this? Is there a way to
mitigate any of this personally? I mean,

131
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,960
mean even shutting your phone off doesn't
even work, right? Well, so it, it, it,

132
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:03,170
it does in a way. It's yes and no. Um,

133
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:06,140
the thing was shutting your phone off
that as a risk is how do you know your

134
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,230
phone is actually turned off?
Um, [inaudible] used to be a, a,

135
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,930
when I was in Geneva, for example,
uh, working for the CIA. Um,

136
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,580
we would all carry like drug
dealer phones, uh, you know,

137
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:24,090
the old smartphones, the, or, sorry, old
dumb phones. They're not smart phones.

138
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,520
And the reason why was just because they
had removed from the backs where you

139
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,100
could take the battery out. Right.

140
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,870
And the one beautiful thing
about technology is if
there's no electricity in it,

141
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,110
right? If there's, there's no
gold juice available to it.

142
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:40,460
If there's no battery connected to it,

143
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,850
it's not sending anything because
you have to get power from somewhere.

144
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:48,020
You have to have power
in order to do work. Um,

145
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,650
but now your phones are all sealed,
right? He can't take the batteries out.

146
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:56,651
So there are potential ways that you
can hack a phone where it appears to be

147
00:08:56,761 --> 00:09:00,030
off, but it's not actually off.
It's just pretending to be off.

148
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:02,430
Whereas in fact it's still listening
in and doing all this stuff.

149
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,240
But for the average person
that doesn't apply. Right.

150
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:09,510
And I got to tell you guys, they've
been chasing me all over the place.

151
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:13,560
I don't worry about that stuff. Right. Um,

152
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,250
and it's because if they are applying
that level of effort to me, uh,

153
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,850
they'll probably get the same
information through other routes. Um,

154
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,870
I am as careful as I can and I
use things like fair to cages.

155
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:28,500
I turn devices off, but
if they're actually, uh,

156
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,450
manipulating the way devices display, um,

157
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,280
it's just too great a level of effort
even for someone like me to keep that up

158
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:38,700
on a constant basis.
Also. Um, if they get me,

159
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,100
I only trust phones so much.

160
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,530
So there's only so much they
can derive from the compromise.

161
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:47,160
And this is how operational
security works. Uh,

162
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,120
you think about what are the realistic
threats that you're facing that you're

163
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:56,121
trying to mitigate and the mitigation
that you're trying to do is what would be

164
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:01,440
the loss? What would be the damage done
to you if this stuff was exploited?

165
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:06,060
Much more realistic than worrying about
these things that I call voodoo hacks,

166
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:07,710
right? Which are like next level stuff.

167
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:12,300
And actually just a shout out for those
of your readers who are interested in

168
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:16,350
this stuff. I wrote a paper
on this specific problem.

169
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:18,300
How do you know when a
phone is actually off?

170
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:22,080
How do you know when it's actually not
spying on you? Uh, with a brilliant,

171
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,740
brilliant guy named, uh, Andrew Bunnie
Quang, uh, he's an MIT PhD and I,

172
00:10:26,741 --> 00:10:30,300
I think electrical engineering, um, uh,

173
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,840
called the introspection engine, uh,

174
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,360
that was published in the journal of
open engineering. You can find it online.

175
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,770
Um, and it'll go as deep down in the
weeds. I promise you as you want.

176
00:10:40,771 --> 00:10:42,960
We take an iPhone six, uh,

177
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:47,280
this was back when it was fairly new
and we modified it so we could actually,

178
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,790
uh, not trust the device,
uh, to report its own state,

179
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,010
but physically monitor it state
to see if it was spying on you.

180
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,460
But for average people, right?
Uh, this sack endemic, uh,

181
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,700
that's not your primary threat.

182
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:03,570
Your primary threats are these
bulk collection programs.

183
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,130
Your primary threat is the fact that your
phone is constantly squawking to these

184
00:11:08,131 --> 00:11:11,820
cell phone towers is doing all of these
things because we leave our phones in a

185
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:15,510
state that is constantly on.
You're constantly connected, right?

186
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,710
Airplane mode a doesn't even
turn off wifi really anymore,

187
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:22,530
just turns off the cellular modem. Um,

188
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,850
but the whole idea is we
need to identify the problem.

189
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,920
And the central problem with smart phone
use today is you have no idea what the

190
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:35,220
hell it's doing at any given time.
Like the phone has the screen off,

191
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,810
you don't know what it's connected to.

192
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,740
You don't know how
frequently it's doing it. Uh,

193
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,650
Apple and iOS unfortunately makes it
impossible to see what kind of network

194
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:47,460
connections are constantly made on the
device and to intermediate them going,

195
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,190
I don't want Facebook to be able
to talk right now. You know,

196
00:11:50,191 --> 00:11:53,410
I don't want Google to be able to
talk right now. I just want my,

197
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:55,840
a secure messenger app to be able to talk.

198
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,450
I just want my weather
app to be able to talk,

199
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,510
but I just checked my weather
and now I'm done with it.

200
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:03,220
So I don't want that to
be able to talk anymore.

201
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:08,380
And we need to be able
to make these intelligent
decisions on not just an app by

202
00:12:08,381 --> 00:12:12,100
app basis, but a connection by
connection basis. Right? You want,

203
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,610
let's say you use
Facebook because you know,

204
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,850
for whatever judgment we have,
a lot of people might do it.

205
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,190
You want it to be able to connect
to Facebook's content servers. Uh,

206
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,960
you want to be able to message a friend.

207
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,300
Do you want to be able to
download a photograph or whatever,

208
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,610
but you don't want it to be
able to talk to an ad server.

209
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,030
You don't want it to talk to an analytics
server that that's monitoring your

210
00:12:34,031 --> 00:12:34,751
behavior, right?

211
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:37,570
You don't want to talk to all these
third party things because Facebook crams

212
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,800
their garbage and almost every app that
you download and you don't even know

213
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,420
what's happening because
you can't see it. Right?

214
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,060
And this is the problem with the data
collection used today is there is an

215
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:51,940
industry that is built on
keeping this invisible.

216
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:57,350
And what we need to do is we need to
make the activities of our devices,

217
00:12:58,031 --> 00:13:00,610
whether it's a phone, whether
it's computer, whatever, uh,

218
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,410
more visible and understandable to the
average person and then give them control

219
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:05,710
over it.

220
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:09,750
So like if you could see your phone
right now and at the very center of his,

221
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,990
a little green icon, that's your
handset or it's a picture of your face,

222
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:17,830
whatever. And then you see all these
little spokes coming off of it.

223
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:23,260
That's every app that your phone is
talking to right now or every app that is

224
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:26,560
active on your phone right now and
all the hosts that it's connecting to.

225
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:31,480
And you can see right now wants every
three seconds your phone is checking into

226
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:35,050
Facebook and you could just
poke that app and then boom,

227
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,180
it's not talking to Facebook
anymore. Facebook's not allowed.

228
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:41,620
Facebook speaking privileges have been
revoked. Right? You would do that.

229
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,460
We would all do that. If there was
a button on your phone that said,

230
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,780
do what I want but not spy on me,
you would press that button. Right?

231
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,330
That button is not, uh, does not exist
right now. And both Google and Apple,

232
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:59,500
unfortunately Apple's a lot better
at this than Google. Uh, but uh,

233
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:03,640
neither of them allow that
button to exist. In fact,

234
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:07,660
they actively interfere with it because
they say it's a security risk and from a

235
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:11,080
particular perspective, they, they
actually aren't wrong there. Um,

236
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,930
but it's not enough to go, you know,

237
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:17,530
we have to lock that capability off
from people because we don't trust they

238
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:18,670
would make the right decisions.

239
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,340
We think it's too complicated
for people to do this.

240
00:14:21,341 --> 00:14:23,410
We think there's too many
connections being made.

241
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,090
Well that is actually a confession
of the problem right there.

242
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,130
If you think people can't understand it,

243
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,500
if you think there are too
many communications happening,

244
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:36,250
if you think there's too much complexity
in there, it needs to be simplified.

245
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,280
Just like the president can't
control everything like that.

246
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,850
If you have to be the president of the
phone and the phone is as complex as the

247
00:14:42,851 --> 00:14:45,730
United States government,
we have a problem guys,

248
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,650
this should be a much more simple process.

249
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,350
It should be obvious and
the fact that it's not.

250
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,560
And the fact we read story after story
year after year saying all your data's

251
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,380
been breached here, uh, this
company's spying on you.

252
00:14:57,381 --> 00:15:02,030
Here is companies manipulating your
purchases or would your search results or

253
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,220
they're hiding these things from your
timeline or they're influencing you or

254
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:12,221
manipulating and all of these different
ways that happens as a result of a

255
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:15,740
single, uh, problem.

256
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,750
And that problem is in any
equality of available information.

257
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,460
They can see everything about you.

258
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,040
They can see everything about what your
device is doing and they can do whatever

259
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:30,020
they want with your device. You on the
other hand, owned the device. Well,

260
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,390
rather you paid for the device.

261
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,870
But increasingly these
corporations own it. Increasingly,

262
00:15:35,871 --> 00:15:37,040
these governments own it,

263
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:41,120
and increasingly we are living in a
world where we do all the work, right?

264
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,490
We pay all the taxes, we
pay all the costs, uh,

265
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,350
but we own less and less,

266
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,050
and nobody understands this better
than the youngest generation.

267
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:51,401
Well,

268
00:15:51,401 --> 00:15:55,720
it seems like our data became a commodity
before we understood what it was.

269
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:00,490
It became this thing that's insanely
valuable to Google and Facebook and all

270
00:16:00,491 --> 00:16:04,630
these social media platforms. Before
we understood what we were giving up,

271
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,520
they were making billions of dollars,

272
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,730
and then once that money is being earned,

273
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,860
and once everyone's
accustomed to this situation,

274
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,170
it's very difficult to
pull the reigns back.

275
00:16:14,171 --> 00:16:18,760
It's very difficult to turn that horse
around precisely because the money then

276
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:22,180
becomes pout. Right? Right. The
information then becomes influence.

277
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:25,150
That also seems to be the same sort of
situation that would happen with these

278
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,390
mass surveillance States
once they have the access,

279
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,870
it's going to be incredibly difficult
for them to relinquish that.

280
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,860
All right. Yeah. No, you're,
you're exactly correct.

281
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,350
And this is the subject
of the book. I mean this,

282
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,630
this is the permanent record
and this is where it came from.

283
00:16:40,631 --> 00:16:43,510
This is how it came to exist. Um,

284
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:48,660
the story of our lifetimes is
how intentionally by design,

285
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,650
uh, a number of institutions, uh,
both governmental and corporate, uh,

286
00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:00,460
realized it was in their mutual interest
to conceal their data collection

287
00:17:00,461 --> 00:17:03,430
activities to increase, uh,

288
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:08,080
the breadth and depth of their sensor
networks that were sort of spread out

289
00:17:08,081 --> 00:17:12,210
through society. Remember back in
the day intelligence collection, uh,

290
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,480
in the United States, even at Sagan
used to mean sending an FBI agent,

291
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,380
right to put alligator clips on an
embassy building or sending in a,

292
00:17:20,381 --> 00:17:21,950
somebody disguised as,

293
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:26,951
as a Workman and they put a bug in a
building or they built a satellite,

294
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,480
uh, listening site, right? We,

295
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,800
we called these foreign set or
foreign satellite collection. Uh,

296
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:37,360
we're out on the desert somewhere. They
built a big, uh, parabolic collector,

297
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,850
um, and it's just listening
to satellite emissions, right?

298
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,420
These satellite emissions, the satellite
links were owned by militaries.

299
00:17:46,421 --> 00:17:50,880
They were exclusive to governments,
right? It wasn't everybody broadly.

300
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,630
Also valence was targeted
because it had to be,

301
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,790
what changed with technology is
that surveillance could now become

302
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:05,430
indiscriminate. It could become a
Dragnet. It could become bulk collection,

303
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:08,750
which should become one of the
dirtiest phrases in the language. Uh,

304
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:12,930
if we have any kind of decency.
Uh, but we were intentionally,

305
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,210
um, this was intentionally concealed from
us. Right? Uh, the government did it,

306
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:21,570
they used classification.
Um, companies did it. Uh,

307
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,450
they intentionally didn't talk
about it. They denied, uh,

308
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:26,160
these things were going,
they, they said, uh,

309
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,980
you agreed to this and you didn't agree
to nothing like this. I'm, I'm sorry.

310
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,920
Right. They go, we put that terms of
service page up and you clicked it.

311
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,650
You clicked a button that said, I agree.

312
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,970
Because you were trying to open an
account so you could talk to your friends.

313
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,920
You were trying to get driving directions.

314
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:45,300
You were trying to get an email account.

315
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:49,410
You weren't trying to agree to
some 600 page legal form. Uh, the,

316
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:52,380
even if you read, you wouldn't
understand and it doesn't matter.

317
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,740
Even if you did understand, because one
of the very first paragraphs in it said,

318
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:00,360
disagreement can be changed at any time
unilaterally without your consent by the

319
00:19:00,361 --> 00:19:02,080
company. Right. Uh,

320
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:07,570
they have built a legal paradigm that
presumes records collected about us do not

321
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:11,940
belong to us.

322
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:17,070
This is a sort of one of
the core principles on which
mass surveillance from the

323
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:19,710
government's perspective in
the United States is legal.

324
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,010
And you have to understand that all
this stuff we talked about today,

325
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,980
government says everything they do is
legal right. And they go, so it's fine.

326
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,250
Our perspective as a
public should be, we'll,

327
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:32,010
that's actually the problem
because this isn't okay.

328
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,710
The scandal isn't how
they're breaking the law.

329
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:40,110
The scandals that they don't have to
break the law and the way they say they're

330
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:42,480
not breaking the law is something
called the third party doctrine.

331
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,720
A third party doctrine is a

332
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:51,600
legal principle and derive from a
case. And I believe the 1970s, uh,

333
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:54,420
called Smith vs Maryland, um,

334
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,770
and Smith was this knucklehead, uh, who
was harassing this lady, making, uh,

335
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:04,140
phone calls, uh, to her house. Uh,
and when she would pick up, he just,

336
00:20:04,141 --> 00:20:07,350
I don't know who sit there,
heavy breathing, whatever,
like a classic creeper.

337
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:13,290
Um, and, you know, it was terrifying.
This poor lady. So she calls the cops,

338
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:14,641
uh, and says,

339
00:20:14,641 --> 00:20:18,690
one day I got one of these phone calls
and then I see this car creeping past my

340
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:21,900
house on the street and she
got a license plate number.

341
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,910
So she goes to the cops and she goes,
is this the guy and the cops, again,

342
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,310
they're trying to do a good thing
here. Uh, they look up his, uh,

343
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,580
license plate number, uh, and they find
out where this guy is. And then they go,

344
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:37,500
well, what phone number is
registered to that house?

345
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:39,990
And they go to the phone company and
they say, can you give us this record?

346
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:44,490
And the phone company says, yeah, sure.
And it's the guy the cops got there,

347
00:20:44,491 --> 00:20:49,110
man. Right. Huh. So they go
arrest guy. And then in court, uh,

348
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,880
his lawyer brings all this
stuff up and they go, um,

349
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:00,300
[inaudible] you did this without a
warrant. Uh, that was, sorry, that was,

350
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,051
that was the, the,

351
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,170
the problem was they went to the phone
company that got the records without a

352
00:21:04,171 --> 00:21:06,720
warrant. They just asked for it
or they subpoenaed it, right?

353
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,010
Some lower standard of legal review and
the company gave it to them and got the

354
00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:13,170
guy they Marchmont in jail. Uh,

355
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,910
and they could have gotten a warrant,
right? But it was just expedience.

356
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:20,610
They just didn't want to take
the time in small town cops,

357
00:21:20,611 --> 00:21:22,980
you can understand how it happens.
They know the guy's a creeper.

358
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:25,380
They just want to get him off to jail. Um,

359
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,350
and so they made a mistake with the
government doesn't want to let go.

360
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,090
They fight on this and
they go, uh, [inaudible].

361
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,140
It wasn't actually, they
weren't his records.

362
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,230
And so because they didn't belong to him,

363
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:42,740
he didn't have a fourth
amendment right. Uh,

364
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,140
to demand a warrant be issued for them.

365
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:49,220
They were the company's records and the
company provided them voluntarily and

366
00:21:49,221 --> 00:21:49,521
hence,

367
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:52,880
no warrant was required because you can
give whatever you want without a warrant

368
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,550
as long as it's yours.
Now, here's the problem.

369
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,240
The government extrapolated a principle
in a single case of a single known,

370
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:03,740
suspected criminal who had,

371
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:07,610
they had real good reasons
to suspect was their guy.

372
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:09,763
Um,

373
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,390
and use that to go to a company and
get records from them and establish a

374
00:22:14,391 --> 00:22:17,190
precedent that these records
don't belong to the guy. Uh,

375
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,550
they belong to the company.
And then they said, well,

376
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:23,570
if one person doesn't have a fourth
amendment interest in records held by a

377
00:22:23,571 --> 00:22:26,000
company, no one does.

378
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:30,650
And so the company then has absolute
proprietary ownership of all of these

379
00:22:30,651 --> 00:22:33,710
records about all of our lives. And
remember, this is back in the 1970s,

380
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:38,680
you know, the internet hardly exists in
these kinds of contexts. Smartphones,

381
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,310
you know, don't exist. Modern society,
modern communications don't exist.

382
00:22:43,311 --> 00:22:47,060
This is the very beginning
of the technological era. Uh,

383
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,260
and flash forward now 40 years,

384
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,833
uh,

385
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:58,690
and they are still relying on this
precedent about this one. You know,

386
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,400
perfect creeper to go.

387
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:03,310
Nobody has a privacy right for
anything that's held by a company.

388
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,620
And so long as they do that,

389
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:09,040
companies are going to be extraordinarily
powerful and they're going to be

390
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:11,920
extraordinarily abusive. And this is
something that people don't get. They go,

391
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:15,790
Oh, well, it's data collection,
right? They're exploiting data. Uh,

392
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:21,100
this is data about human lives.
Uh, it is state about people.

393
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:26,080
These records are about you. It's
not data that's being exploited. Uh,

394
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,590
it's people that are being
exploited. It's not, um,

395
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:34,690
data that's being manipulated.
It's you that's being,

396
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,530
uh, manipulated. And this, this is a,

397
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:43,030
this is something that I think a lot of
people are beginning to understand. Now,

398
00:23:43,031 --> 00:23:45,160
the problem is the companies and the
governments are still pretending,

399
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,040
don't understand or disagreeing
with this. And this is wrong.

400
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:51,890
My ends me of something that, uh, one of
my old friends, uh, John Perry Barlow,

401
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,860
um, who served with me, uh,

402
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:58,940
at the freedom of the press foundation
on the president of the board, uh,

403
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:03,120
used to say to me, um, which is a,

404
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,170
you can't awaken someone
who's pretending to be asleep.

405
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:13,780
[inaudible].
