1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,700
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,020
Do you see that male who identifies
as a female just broke all these world

3
00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:11,250
records in weightlifting? The
new one just came out. Wonderful.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,340
Congratulations.
Everybody broke everything.

5
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:20,470
Fucking so progressive and so
preposterous that we broke everything.

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,930
You have men that are women when women's
world records in fucking weightlifting,

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,630
which is like the dumbest shit I agree
for men and women compete against.

8
00:00:29,631 --> 00:00:33,480
If there's ever one thing, even though I
like the tennis argument, it's like, well,

9
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:36,090
you know Billie Jean King
beat Bobby Riggs. Yeah,

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,480
but Bobby Riggs was 55 she was 29 and
they say that he threw the match because

11
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:47,250
he bet against himself. I'll write. He
was a big gambler. That was what I heard.

12
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:49,820
But yeah, I would say that
too of I lost. Yeah. You know,

13
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:54,750
let's say I threw the match. Yeah. Well,
yeah. Basketball is 10 is this the woman?

14
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,970
The One? Yes. Says Chelsea, this is, uh,

15
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,100
the women who's winning is not Bruce
Jenner records. Okay, let's get a look.

16
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,370
Oh my goodness. Here we go.
It seems like I go, Huh?

17
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,460
That seems like a very strong man.

18
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,460
Yes. So how much weight is
that? It doesn't look very
a lot of weight. It's like,

19
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,430
oh, this, this is all about,
this is about reps here.

20
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:21,840
300 303 15 yeah. I'm like, okay,

21
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,690
that's a ridiculous amount of weight for
a woman to lift to [inaudible] for if

22
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,980
you're going to be a real woman,
biological woman, excuse me,

23
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,930
and lift that kind of weight. You have to
be a real outlier. Yeah. It's very rare.

24
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:38,730
Yeah, but this is so ridiculous.
Wow. Oh, what is this? This is,

25
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,730
what does this guy's quote? What does
it say? One guy in the comments say,

26
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:43,650
congratulations on your
excellent performance. Screw.

27
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:47,250
Anybody who tries to knock achievements,
the hard work speaks for itself. Hey,

28
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,870
whoever you are, fuck you. Yeah,
fuck you and your nonsense.

29
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,080
You're the reason why this
shit is happening in the
first place because people

30
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,480
tolerate this and that is nuts.
If you,

31
00:01:57,481 --> 00:02:01,080
if you had a daughter that trained her
whole life to be a weightlifter and she's

32
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:03,480
really into it and this
fucking guy decides,

33
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:06,960
he identifies as a woman and then
compete as a woman in weightlifting,

34
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,470
it's just fucking stop.
Everybody just stopped.

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,420
You're in crazy town. This is
officially crazytown. Yeah,

36
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,240
out of our fucking miles and how
it's legal, what is illegal? It's,

37
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,720
it has nothing to do with
being open minded or tolerant.

38
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:25,950
It has something to do with logic.
Just basic reason. This is craziness.

39
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,400
This is you're enabling people to
do something that's preposterous.

40
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,490
This is nothing to do with being
open minded are kind to people.

41
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,620
I'm 100% for people being trans.

42
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,140
I'm 100% for people doing
whatever they want to do.

43
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,380
Just don't hurt anybody and I'm cool
with that same Mary's, but this is just,

44
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:42,020
you're in make believe town.
Why not?

45
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,290
Pretend you're a fox and go
live in the forest you're in.

46
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,340
Make believe this is
make believe you can't.

47
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,840
You can't just decide you're a
woman and compete with women, right?

48
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,990
It's make belief you. Oh,
I, there's no advantage.

49
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,110
Make belief that's make believe it
is. Michael is an advantage. Yeah,

50
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:02,260
I fucking know there's an advantage.
Yes. Everyone knows this is crazy.

51
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,590
I want to uh, see that
in the NFL. You know,

52
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:08,170
you got like what does
that before and after?

53
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,060
Is it two different looks the same
day to see this person is sick.

54
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,760
I don't want to shame this person. Look,
someone's letting her do this. Right.

55
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:17,950
You know, it's nice. The problem.
That's the problem. They should sit,

56
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,130
there should be a transgender league,
right?

57
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,460
Or there should be some rules where you
have to compete with the chromosome,

58
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:26,650
your birth.
You don't have to fucking compete.

59
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,930
Most people don't compete in organized
sports. Most people don't know.

60
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,030
And if you're trans, maybe that
should be something you can't do it.

61
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:36,460
And particularly for girls
who transitioned to boys,

62
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:40,810
you know that school in Texas that won't
let this girl is transitioning to a boy,

63
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,490
they won't let her compete with boys.

64
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,050
So they make her compete with girls and
she's on fucking testosterone. Right?

65
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,650
So she's taking testosterone to be,
or he's taking testosterone,

66
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:53,240
whatever you want to say.
I get so confused. Yeah.

67
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,280
To become a board Zur is taking
testosterone to become a boy. Yes.

68
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,290
And then now is forced to
wrestle with women. Yes.

69
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,110
Young girls. Yeah. In fact, all
jacked. Right Jack? Like a boy.

70
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:09,460
It's like a boy wrestling girls. It's
crazy. Probably pop a boner doing that.

71
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:14,150
I don't think she has one yet. You can get
a little thumb. You grow a thumb. Yeah.

72
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,940
That's what happens. Oh yeah. Yeah. The
clearest gets a little bit bigger. Yeah.

73
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,900
And did the ovary sort of like start
getting suspended in a, I don't know,

74
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,550
they come to these drops.
What do they do?

75
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,340
No wonder the wonder that if they remove
those parts, you know, because they do,

76
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:29,170
hysterectomy is on women
when they have diseases.

77
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:33,700
And what if they do that when a man, when
a man transitions from a woman. Yeah.

78
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,000
When a man transitions from a woman.
Yeah.

79
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:39,730
When you used to be a woman and now
you're going into the dude. Yeah.

80
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:44,200
What do they do? I just can't wait til
the day where they can do it genetically.

81
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,180
Where a woman really becomes a woman,

82
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,020
like a man becomes a woman or a
woman becomes a man. But guess what?

83
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,660
Even if they do,
here's the issue.

84
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:58,020
If you knew that a woman took steroids
for 30 years and developed insane tendon

85
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:01,990
strength and muscle strength
and then stopped doing steroids,

86
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,380
it is a scientific fact that you are
going to keep a very big percentage of

87
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:09,120
those gains.
What are the games?

88
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,220
What is the percentage that 30%
or 40% whatever the fuck it is,

89
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,370
whatever percentage that you would
keep after you get off the steroids,

90
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,340
that is significant in,

91
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:21,490
even if you're not currently on
these performance enhancing drugs,

92
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,760
your body has been artificially boosted
to the superior level through these

93
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:32,400
drugs. Yeah. And you lose a lot of the
feminine and you lose the breast. Yes.

94
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,700
Does it might not come back? Um, well,
I mean I think if you take estrogen,

95
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:39,970
they'll probably call ray. I don't know.
I'm not a fucking doctor. I'm a moron.

96
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,020
I thought what I do know is when this
is, we're in nonsense land. Yeah, okay.

97
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,850
It's not, it's not saying that someone
can't become a woman and be a woman.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,620
I'll talk, I'll call them a woman.
I'll treat him like a woman.

99
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,760
I'm cool with it and I'm 100% cool that
I'm in as open minded as I come with

100
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:59,630
this. But this is, this is
unfair for which is what's
so ironic about this. Yeah.

101
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,580
Cause everyone's supposed
to be looking out for women.

102
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,870
If you're looking out for women,

103
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,830
but you're also blindly progressive to
the point where you let and shit like

104
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:09,140
this fly, well now you're not
looking out for women. Right?

105
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,740
Because now women are in
this weird position where
you're putting them there at

106
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:17,380
an unfair disadvantage. Right.
Fucking crazy. I agree. Goddamn.

107
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,950
And it makes me want
to drink real Heineken.

108
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,980
I'm getting beyond this double zero.
No, they're just sent this stuff to me.

109
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:29,420
It's good. Yeah. Um, I used
to love Heineken light.

110
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,300
I talk about that subject a little
bit too much, but it's just,

111
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:35,090
it's a symptom of a sick society.

112
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,330
It's a symptom of a lack
of rational thinking.

113
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,800
It's a symptom of people just just
be being bending over backwards.

114
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:46,850
So hard to be progressive and
open minded that you're just,

115
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,610
you're giving into these extremists,

116
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:52,660
these crazy people that are looking
at this thing completely delusional.
