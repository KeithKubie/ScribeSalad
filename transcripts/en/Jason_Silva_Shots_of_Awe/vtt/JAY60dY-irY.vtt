00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.470
John Paul Sartre
says, "everything

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.960
has been figured out,
except how to live."

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.770
So perhaps the better
question is not

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.810
what are we to do
with death, but what

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.660
are we to do with life?

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.480
Life exists in individual
moments, and it is up to us

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.240
to make sure that
those moments are

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.250
vast, interconnected and grand.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.280
To make a masterpiece
out of life.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.835
One that we would willingly
live again and again

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:36.770
for all of eternity.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.945
This is what we
could strive for.

00:00:38.945 --> 00:00:40.430
And I love this idea.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.260
This idea of
aestheticing our lives,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.900
of italicizing our
experience, of turning

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.000
our story into THE story.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.210
Of seeing the universal
in the specific.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.120
Sort of aligning ourselves with
the archetype of the hero's

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.710
journey.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.920
Of trying to see a
departure from the ordinary

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.300
in every single instance.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.950
A chance to learn something new.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.134
A chance to leverage
obstacles and learn from them,

00:01:05.134 --> 00:01:07.550
and meet people along the way
that can teach us something.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.008
It's what the movie
Eat, Pray, Love

00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:10.380
talks about-- quest physics.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.700
The physics of the quest.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.840
If you believe, and
you're willing to step out

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.656
of your comfort
zone, life will begin

00:01:15.656 --> 00:01:17.030
at the edge of
your comfort zone.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.890
If you're able to treat what
seems like despair, what

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.680
seems like hardship
as an opportunity

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.460
to reinvent yourself and to
transcend your own limitations,

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.080
as David Johnson says, "the
world is full of clues,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.760
and you can read
your way though it."

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.700
If you're able to turn your
life into an art piece,

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.170
if you're able to turn your
narrative into THE narrative,

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.470
then you become that hero.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.280
You become the god
of your own life.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.700
It's the archetype
in every film.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:47.500
It is the Joseph Campbell hero's
journey, and that's just rad.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.670
That's just a cool idea.
