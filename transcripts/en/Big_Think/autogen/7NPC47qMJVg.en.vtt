now which tendency will win I don't know

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680
now which tendency will win I don't know
 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.240
now which tendency will win I don't know
but I hope that we emerge as a type one

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250
but I hope that we emerge as a type one

but I hope that we emerge as a type one
civilization now in outer space we look

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130
civilization now in outer space we look
 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.400
civilization now in outer space we look
for signs full of intelligent life in

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410
for signs full of intelligent life in
 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.970
for signs full of intelligent life in
outer space so far we find none

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980
outer space so far we find none

civilizations like type 1 should be

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940
civilizations like type 1 should be
 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.580

planetary suicide so maybe that's the

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150
planetary suicide so maybe that's the
 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.570
planetary suicide so maybe that's the
reason why we don't see aliens in outer

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580

day when we have starships and visit

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260
day when we have starships and visit
 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.440
day when we have starships and visit
them we'll see atmospheres that are

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450
them we'll see atmospheres that are
 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.970
them we'll see atmospheres that are
irradiated because they had a nuclear

because they had a runaway greenhouse

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060
because they had a runaway greenhouse

because they had a runaway greenhouse
effect maybe when we go in out of space

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940
effect maybe when we go in out of space
 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.600

we'll see the corpses of type 1

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610
we'll see the corpses of type 1
 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.940
