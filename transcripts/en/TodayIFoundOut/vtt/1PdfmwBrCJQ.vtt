00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.370
Long before the likes of Warren Buffet, Hetty
Green dominated Wall Street through extremely

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.700
shrewd investing, frugality, and exploiting
the lax investment rules of her age, managing

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.400
to amass one of the greatest fortunes in history.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.280
Hetty, born Henrietta Howland Robinson in
1834, was the daughter of Edward and Abby

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.280
Robinson.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.960
The family first made their fortune thanks
to Hetty’s great-grandfather who went to

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.510
sea as a whaler.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.280
Within two generations, the family under the
guidance of Hetty’s father and maternal

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.449
grandfather amassed one of the biggest whaling
fleets in North America, with her father increasing

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.060
the family fortune twenty fold in his lifetime.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.650
Hetty’s business education started early
at the tender age of six years old, reading

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.000
the financial news to her maternal grandfather,
Gideon Howland, whose failing eyesight prevented

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.729
him from doing it himself.

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.500
During these readings, her grandfather also
discussed what she was reading with her.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.270
Two years later, Hetty opened her first bank
account.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.740
Shortly thereafter, she began investing her
allowance.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.140
By 13 years old, she took over management
of the family bookkeeping, which was no small

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.630
thing considering the many business deals
her father was involved in.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.720
Needless to say, between helping her grandfather
and father in their respective business dealings,

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.740
Hetty was receiving a first class education
in the world of business.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.510
As she exited her teen years, her father was
more interested in seeing Hetty married off

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:46.850
than becoming a successful businesswoman,
so purchased a $1200 wardrobe ($30,600 today)

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.990
for her to wear around Boston and New York
to attract wealthy men.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.240
Hetty was “a good looking woman… [with]
angelic blue eyes” so this wouldn’t have

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.010
been a problem, but she had no interest in
it.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.120
Upon receiving the gift of the wardrobe, Hetty
promptly sold off the clothing and invested

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.700
the money from the sale.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.730
While she did well for herself with these
small sums, her “seed money” really jumped

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.459
after the death of her father when Hetty was
30 years old.

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.330
Hetty had previously been supposed to inherit
much of her mother’s estate upon her passing,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.730
but her father took most of it for himself.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.250
Rather than risk losing out on being the heir
to his more significant fortune, Hetty took

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.620
it in stride and did not bring a lawsuit against
her father.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.330
She didn’t have to wait long for the money.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.569
Her father died just five years after her
mother, bequeathing his entire estate to her,

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:38.209
which at this point had risen to about $5-$7
million ($75-$105 million today).

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.069
She promptly took the money she had instant
access too (much of it was left in a trust

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.040
for her to draw from annually) and invested
it in the highly risky (or so others thought)

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.829
U.S. Civil War bonds.

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.690
But even investing the money from her father
wasn’t enough for Hetty.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.540
Her aunt, Sylvia Ann Howland, died within
a year of her father, but rather than leave

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.270
Hetty her fortune of about $2 million as she
had once said she’d do, she left most of

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.310
it to charity, her doctor and caretakers,
and some of Hetty’s cousins.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.800
This didn’t sit well with Hetty, who had
taken to heart something her father had once

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.560
told her, “…never give anyone anything,
not even a kindness.”

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.799
Thus, Hetty challenged the will, even going
so far as forging a new one that stated her

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.400
aunt’s fortune should be left to Hetty.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.620
In the end, Hetty lost the case of “Robinson
v. Mandell” with the court determining the

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.590
signature on the will was a forgery.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.400
However, in the end, Hetty was able to wrangle
approximately $600,000 out of her aunt’s

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.400
estate.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.959
In the interim, Hetty married a successful
businessman, Edward Green, in 1867, but not

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.260
before getting him to agree to keep all finances
separate and that neither of them was entitled

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.900
to any of the others’ money.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.999
The fact that Hetty had tried to swindle away
her aunt’s estate via forging a will didn’t

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:47.040
sit well with a few of Hetty’s cousins.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.579
To avoid the legal troubles that were headed
her way, Hetty and her husband moved to England.

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.809
While there, besides increasing her already
vast fortune by continuing to heavily invest

00:03:55.809 --> 00:04:00.249
in the United States (this time investing
in greenbacks and railroads in the U.S., and

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:04.849
later in U.S. real estate mortgages, among
other things), Hetty also had two children,

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:10.219
Edward “Ned” Green (1868) and Harriet
Sylvia Green (1871).

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:14.359
Once the statute of limitations was up on
her former legal problems, the Greens moved

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.070
back to the United States in 1875.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.260
In 1885, it was discovered that her decision
to keep her finances separate from her husband’s

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.440
was a wise one.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.350
Hetty staunchly practiced principles such
as always keeping large sums of cash in reserve;

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.810
investing heavily when others were being conservative;
cashing out when everyone else was bullish

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.190
(rarely hanging on to investments long term,
selling as soon as something hit the price

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.280
she had originally been looking for when she
bought it); never accumulating any debt; keeping

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.199
a cool head in any crisis; and incessantly
researching any investment before making it.

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:48.570
Her husband went the other way and primarily
speculated, not afraid to borrow money to

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.160
up his potential gain in his high risk investing.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.630
Unfortunately for him, his investments were
high risk for a reason.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.199
He squandered his $2 million fortune.

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.960
To try to dig out of his financial woes, he
got banks to lend money to him with the implication

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.699
that Hetty’s fortune was backing the loan,
even though this wasn’t the case.

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:08.830
He soon amassed massive debts, some of which
were known to Hetty who bailed him out of

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.540
his problems on a few occasions.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.450
However, Hetty finally discovered the extent
of his debt after the collapse of John J.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.560
Cisco &amp; Son’s financial house, which Hetty
was the largest investor in.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.150
It turns out, her husband was the biggest
debtor of the firm.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.990
Needless to say, she gave him the boot.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.310
(However, they remained married and in the
last few years of his life as his health deteriorated,

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.710
she took care of him and even converted to
Episcopalian before her own death so that

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.090
she could be buried beside him.)

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.610
Up to this point, Hetty had exhibited savvy
investing skills, along with a bull-dog like

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.900
business demeanor (fending off many an attempt
by groups of investors to ruin her, often

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.840
ultimately ruining them in the process).

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.689
But after separating from her husband, she
added in a slew of eccentricities, and the

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:51.039
public ate it up.

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:55.580
It’s difficult to separate the myth and
exaggerations from fact, particularly as she

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:01.039
was a woman who’d become wildly successful
in business in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:05.650
This was something not appreciated by many
powerful businessmen; so negative rumors about

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.569
her, probably generally baseless, were rampant.

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:13.680
That said, a few peculiarities that are backed
up with a reasonable amount of documentation

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.849
include that she constantly moved from district
to district in an effort to avoid having to

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:24.770
pay taxes in a given district, generally living
in the cheapest housing available despite

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.189
her fortune.

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:30.500
She also reportedly often used her dog’s
name on the records for her lodging, so as

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.840
to further throw any tax collectors off the
scent.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.690
In addition to that, when her son injured
his leg at nine years old, rather than use

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.439
her fortune to get him the finest medical
care available, she initially took him to

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:41.629
a charity hospital.

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:45.860
However, contrary to what you’ll often read,
she later did take him to other doctors as

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.460
he continued to have leg problems for a few
years.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.189
Ultimately, the leg became gangrenes and it
had to be amputated.

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:57.289
Beyond not liking to spring for medical care,
she also reportedly completely neglected personal

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:00.199
hygiene, and rarely washed or changed her
clothes.

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:03.539
Particularly in the summertime, the media
frequently reported that she stank.

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:06.199
They also reported that she constantly haggled
over the prices she had to pay for anything,

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:08.580
and whenever possible refused to pay if she
could get away with it and keep the item or

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.580
still acquire whatever service.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.720
Perhaps one of her most famous tales had little
to do with her legendary stinginess.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:18.009
In this case, it was a time when she pulled
a gun on railroad tycoon Collis P. Huntington.

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:23.110
Huntington was upset with the exorbitant prices
Hetty charged for small, but critically located,

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.669
railroads she’d acquired.

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:27.060
So he decided to try threatening her.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.919
Specifically, he reportedly threatened to
have police and judges that were on his payroll

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:32.729
have Hetty’s son imprisoned.

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:35.979
Rather than giving in, her response was to
simply pull her gun out.

00:07:35.979 --> 00:07:40.169
This is perhaps not surprising given Huntington
had made the mistake of threatening the only

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:43.789
two things Hetty seemed to care about- her
money and her children.

00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:47.090
hetty-green1For all this, and more to the
point that she was a wildly successful woman

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.340
in the business world in an era where women
were expected to stay at home, she was dubbed

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.880
the “Witch of Wall Street.”

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.129
Perhaps more deservedly, her name became synonymous
with “miser” throughout the United States,

00:07:57.129 --> 00:08:01.430
even later being named by the Guinness Book
of World Records as the “World’s Greatest

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.430
Miser.”

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:06.060
She would say of all this, “My life is written
for me down in Wall Street by people who,

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.550
I assume, do not care to know one iota of
the real Hetty Green.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.550
I am in earnest; therefore they picture me
as heartless.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.880
I go my own way.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:19.449
I take no partner, risk nobody else’s fortune,
therefore I am Madame Ishmael, set against

00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:20.449
every man.”

00:08:20.449 --> 00:08:21.750
While exact amounts aren’t known precisely,
it is generally estimated that for her pre-three

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:26.530
ghosts, Scrooge-like life, by the time of
her death on July 3, 1916 at the age of 82,

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:32.700
Hetty had amassed a fortune of just over $200
million (about $5 billion today).

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.919
While she had groomed her son to take over
her fortune, teaching him everything she knew

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:41.250
about investing, he didn’t inherit her frugality
or aversion to giving to charities.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:45.500
He spent and donated lavishly and despite
savvy investing as well (even weathering the

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:50.510
Great Depression mostly unscathed), by the
time of his death in 1937, his fortune hadn’t

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:54.840
risen at all, still about the $100 million
he inherited from his mother.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:59.020
This all went to his sister, Sylvia, to add
to the $100 or so million she’d inherited

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.020
from Hetty.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:05.590
Sylvia lived to 1951, ultimately leaving her
entire estate of about $200 million (about

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:10.630
$1.7 billion today) to various charities,
hospitals, universities, and churches.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.120
So, in the end, despite Hetty having been
loath to spend, let alone give, away a dime

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.470
of money she didn’t have to, a large portion
of her amassed fortune ended up going to charity

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.540
thanks to her children.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.150
Hetty wasn’t universally cheap.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:25.320
One of the rare instances where she decided
to loosen her purse strings was for her daughter,

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.320
Sylvia.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.220
Not only did she temporarily put her up in
an upscale hotel, but also provided her with

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:34.500
a fine wardrobe, all in an effort to find
her daughter a good husband (one that wasn’t

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.040
simply gold-digging), which she ultimately
did in the great-grandson of John Jacob Astor

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.390
I, Matthew Astor Wilks.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:44.470
Wilks came to the marriage with $2 million
of his own money.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:48.630
A paltry sum by Hetty’s standards, but enough
that she was convinced Wilks wasn’t just

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.310
after Sylvia’s inheritance.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:54.530
Of course, she also made Wilks sign a pre-nup
stating he’d not be entitled to any of Sylvia’s

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:55.530
inheritance.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:56.580
Hetty also sprung for the wedding.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.010
Suitable for the stations of the families
involved, it was a lavish affair.

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:03.990
As for her son, Edward (known by Ned), she
also wasn’t always cheap with him.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:07.970
She sent him to law school, then slowly began
allowing him to manage some of her investments

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:11.300
in order to continue the training she’d
began with him at a younger age.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.720
He was successful at this in the various cities
she sent him.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.472
After seeing this, she allowed him to use
some of the money she gave him to manage to

00:10:17.472 --> 00:10:22.100
put himself up in fancy hotels, as well as
pay for his live-in prostitute Mabel Harlow

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.200
(who lived with him for the rest of his life)
and the steady stream of women Harlow managed

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.440
to procure for him.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.910
Hetty thought this arrangement a good one
as she felt it helped shield her son from

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:34.980
the influences of the various gold-diggers
who were after the family fortune.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:38.560
As his success in business grew, she called
him back home to manage her main investments

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.901
in New York, and didn’t complain when he
once again set himself up with Mabel in a

00:10:42.901 --> 00:10:44.220
extravagant townhouse.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.820
While Ned kept his promise and didn’t marry
while his mother lived, as soon as she died,

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:53.320
he married Mabel, with a pre-nup stipulating
that she’d get $1500 per month ($25,000

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.250
today) for the rest of her life.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:58.580
Being married changed nothing about their
relationship though; she still continually

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.980
found him a steady stream of teenage girls
to serve as “private secretaries.”

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.230
Essentially, he’d grant each girl a trust
fund and pay for her education.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:09.950
In exchange, for the duration of the girls’
schooling, they would stay at Mabel and Ned’s

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:12.480
home in Dartmouth on the weekends.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:18.080
After contracting pneumonia at the age of
77 in one of her “cold-water,” cheap lodgings,

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.820
Hetty finally relented and sought out better
accommodations.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:25.230
Even still, she worked out a deal where she
wouldn’t have to pay any more for the nicer

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.230
room.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.190
She simply moved in with her son, agreeing
to pay him the paltry amount she’d paid

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.410
at her previous lodgings.

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:35.890
Among many other education-based charitable
contributions, Ned funded the building of

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:40.670
a radio transmitter by Dartmouth College which
was used to communicate with Richard E. Byrd

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.720
as he explored the Antarctic (1928-1930).

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.610
Later, after Sylvia had inherited the estate,
she donated Ned’s Round Hill house to MIT.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:12:15.260
Scientists at MIT used the grounds for such
things as building a prototype atom smasher.
