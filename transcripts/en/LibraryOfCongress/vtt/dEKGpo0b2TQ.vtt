&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.550
&gt;&gt; I'm Patrick Anderson.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:09.343
I review fiction for the
Washington Post and all of us

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.526
at the Post are very--
thank you, thank you.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.520
[ Laughter ]

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.520
[ Applause ]

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.520
&gt;&gt; I trust that's for
the Post and not for me.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:20.736
All of us at the Post are very,
very proud to be associated

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.203
with this wonderful event and
we're very grateful to all of you

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.270
for making it such a
success for 10 years now.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.990
It's now my pleasure to
introduce a master story teller

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.783
who for 30 years has been one

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.933
of the world's bestselling
authors, Ken Follett.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.516
Mr. Follett has had an extraordinary
life and I can only touch

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.216
on a few highlights briefly.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.566
He was born in Cardiff, Wales
and a son of a tax inspector.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.703
He was educated at state schools
and University College London.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.163
In his 20s, he first worked as
a newspaper reporter and then

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.500
as an editor for a publishing house.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.906
He was also writing in his
spare of time and in 1979,

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.083
his novel Eye of the Needle
became a worldwide success

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.120
but please note this.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.986
Eye of the Needle wasn't
Mr. Follett's first book.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.970
It was his 11th book and
he was still in his 20s.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.170
This is a very determined man.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.893
[Laughter] That initial success
has been followed by 30 years by--

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.776
for 30 years by a whirlwind of
international bestsellers, movies,

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.690
mini series, prizes, and acclaim.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.846
A partial list of his novels
would include the Key to Rebecca,

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.700
The Man from St. Petersburg,
Lie Down with Lions,

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.780
On the Wings of Eagles,
The Pillars of the Earth,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.920
and its sequel World Without End.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.656
Moreover, Mr. Follett has a
life away from his computer.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.920
He plays guitar in a group called
Damn Right I Got the Blues.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.940
[ Laughter ]

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.570
&gt;&gt; Chicago Blues are
their specialty.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.676
And he and his wife who was a
member of parliament have been--

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.523
long been active in England's
Labour Party as well as in civic,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.373
educational, and charitable
activities.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.943
His new novel, Fall of Giants,
is the first volume of a trilogy

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.213
that will carry five
families through many

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.110
of the great events
of the 20th Century.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.123
It will be officially published next
Tuesday although I suspect a number

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.716
of you already have copies and in
14 countries it will be officially

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.623
published next Tuesday.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.916
And we're very fortunate to have
him here today to discuss it.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.063
Let's welcome Ken Follett.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:39.830
[ Applause ]

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.400
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.733
Thank you very much.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.400
Thank you.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.600
It's a great pleasure to be here.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.600
In fact, I can't think of
anywhere better to be--

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.000
I think I'd be worried
if I wasn't here.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.600
I mean where else should
an author be [laughter],

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.333
you know, on a day like this.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.200
All these people, it's
a wonderful occasion

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.400
and I'm very happy to be here.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.773
I'm gonna talk a bit
about Fall of Giants.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.876
My last book World Without End
kind of spoiled me in two ways.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.563
I didn't-- it was like
running a marathon.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.396
It's very long-- it's the
longest book I've ever written

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.510
about 420,000 words and I didn't
wanna go back to writing thrillers

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.376
which seemed like going from
the marathon to the sprint.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.530
And also, you responded so
warmly to World Without End.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.996
People all over the world
liked it so much that I wanted

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.376
to do something like that
again, but I didn't want

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.013
to write another medieval story.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.990
The Pillars of the Earth and
World Without End both set

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.506
in the Middle Ages and I'm thrilled
that readers liked them so much,

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.940
but I also don't wanna be the guy
that writes medieval books partly

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.483
because I've always kind of chalked
and changed a bit in my career

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.843
and it-- that's good for me
because it keeps me infested,

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.400
and I think it's good for
readers because if, you know,

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.153
if the material fascinates
me and excites me,

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.486
then I think that helps me to make
it fascinating and exciting for you.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.953
So I wanted to change, so what
could I do that would have the kind

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.360
of sweep of World Without End?

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.160
World Without End is
about the Black Death.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.700
The Pillars of the Earth is
about building a cathedral.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.043
What could I write that would
have that kind of scope?

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.130
And I thought about the 20th Century
because it's the most dramatic

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.513
and violent century in
the history of human race

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.233
and it's also our history.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.300
I lived through half of it.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.573
All of my readers will have lived
through some of the 20th Century

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.220
and our parents and grandparents
lived through the rest of it

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.220
so it's where we came from.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.813
As well as being very
dramatic in its own right.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.943
I also think that it's
the kind of book

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.990
that isn't written much anymore,
a sort of long meaty tale

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.610
that describes an entire society.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.156
And I thought of-- there
are some other books that do

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:16.596
that whose subject is an
entire society, one that sprang

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.496
to mind funny enough
was Peyton Place.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.963
Do you remember Peyton Place?

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.030
[ Laughter ]

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.076
&gt;&gt; It was-- it was notorious
really because it was so sexy,

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.383
but it kind of described that whole
town and then by a huge contrast,

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.960
Middlemarch by George Eliot

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.376
which also describes a whole
town although she leaves

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:40.660
out all the bit that-- bits that
Grace Matellios [phonetic] has put

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.560
in about the kind of
sleazy underside of life.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:47.863
I think the charm of
books like that is

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.063
that they describe a whole society.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.360
The Last Days of Pompeii, a
classic book by Bulwer-Lytton,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.533
same sort of thing, it
describes the whole society.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.546
So I've got a feeling that one of
the things that readers like is

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.453
that sense of painting
on a big canvas.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.343
Now, I said the 20th Century
is very dramatic and bloody.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.183
It's also too long for one book
so I've decided to write a trilogy

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.800
and divide it into 3 by 3
wars, the First World War,

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.483
The Second World War,
and the Cold War.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.230
And I looked around for
a novel that I could read

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.276
that would show me how
another author had dealt

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.743
with writing something like this
from an international point of view.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.706
And I discovered that
nobody's done that.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.393
There are books like this.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:47.890
The book I read with most interest
was the Winds of War by Herman Wouk

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.533
which I imagined many people
in the room have read.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.126
He wrote two books.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:57.060
He also wrote War in Remembrance.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:59.860
But that tells the story
of World War 2 really

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.526
from a very American point
of view and I wanted to write

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.260
from an international point of view.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.346
So I-- so how was I
gonna-- I developed--

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.720
I decided they would need to be
five families to tell a story

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.176
of the 20th Century from an
international point of view.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.303
So we have an American
family, of course, a young man,

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.440
a young American man
who's a very minor aid

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:26.976
in the White House working
with Woodrow Wilson.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.836
We have a Russian family,
two brothers one--

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:32.100
two brothers who wanna
go to America.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.040
One goes to America and
the other stays behind

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.293
that becomes a revolutionist.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.806
Actually, that part of the story is
based on a true story that a friend

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.580
of mine told me years
ago about how his mother

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.360
and her two brothers had been
saving up to leave Russia in 1914.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:50.860
They got enough money
for one ticket.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:52.860
They sent their sister,
the youngest,

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:55.126
and the other two brothers
never made it.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:56.726
They were recruited into the army.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:58.793
They fought in the First World War.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.326
They became revolutionaries.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.326
They became commissaries
in the Soviet Union

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.593
and they led terrific
career in the Soviet Union

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.113
and never went to America.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.046
And my friend's mother,
at the age of 90,

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.550
saw an ad in Los Angeles Times
saying, from a private detective,

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:17.646
"I will put you in touch with your
long lost relatives in Russia.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.480
Send me 100 dollars."

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:22.590
And she did and my
friend said this maybe--

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.563
you're never gonna see your 100
dollars and you're never gonna see

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.710
that detective, but he was wrong.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:28.783
She got in touch with her brothers.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:31.060
So the Peshkov family is kind
of based on a true story.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.193
And just to finish that story, when
my friend's mother finally went back

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.273
to Russia and met up
with her brothers,

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:42.326
you'll never guess
what they said to her.

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.460
They were retired by then and
they said, we're still powerful

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.326
and we think we can
get you over here.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.360
[ Laughter ]

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.240
&gt;&gt; They really felt quite guilty.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.290
She'd been the unlucky one.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.290
She'd spent her life living

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:00.623
in California driving a Cadillac
wearing a mint coat [laughter]

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.690
and she missed out on everything.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.350
Anyway, that was the-- that was
the inspiration for the Peshkovs

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.416
and we have a German
family, a young spy,

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:09.416
a young German diplomat who's
also a spy, an English family

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.470
of Aristocrats, and the
family of Welsh coal miners.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:19.810
Now, some of you know that
I'm Welsh and so the--

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.390
and my grandfather was a coal miner.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.960
So the-- that part came natural--

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:26.796
naturally to me writing the
family of Welsh coal miners.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.530
And so we see the seismic
events of world history

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:37.070
through the eyes of these people.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.106
Some of them, very ordinary
people from very poor families,

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.286
some of them very powerful
people, very upper class people,

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.246
very wealthy people,
and we see them all.

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:48.066
And the other thing I wanted
to do, I could've written kind

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:50.390
of five parallel novels about
these five families as they passed

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:55.110
through these events, but I
thought it would be more interesting

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:02.430
and more fun for me to write and
for you to read if they all met

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:03.773
and inter-linked, and they-- some
of them fell in love and some

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.566
of them came to hate
one another, and so on.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.273
&gt;&gt; So the five families
all interlink as they go

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.933
through these-- these great events.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.420
Now, I will-- I'm gonna
read you a short scene

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.216
which I'm kind of pleased with.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.150
I hope you like this
scene as much as I do.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:26.750
And it's set-- it's set
towards the end of the book.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.373
Fitz is the Earl-- Fitz Herbert.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.493
He's called Fitz and he was in--
he was supposed to be the villain

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.350
of this story, actually, but I got
to kind of liked him in the end.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.296
So he's not that villain.

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:43.903
He does some bad things, but
he's not that villainous.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:46.153
So this is one of his scenes
and I'll read you this

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.300
and then I'd be very
happy when I've read this

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:49.690
to answer questions 'cause
that's always the most fun part

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.283
of a-- an occasion like this.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.683
And there are two microphones here.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:59.350
So if you wanna ask questions,

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:00.483
all you have to do is
come up to the microphone.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:02.550
Fitz was outraged.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.683
That summer of 1920.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:06.393
When a Russian trade delegation
came to London and was welcomed

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:08.593
by the Prime Minister David Lloyd
George at #10 Downing Street.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:12.906
The Bolsheviks was still at war
with the newly reconstituted country

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.260
of Poland and Fitz thought Britain
should be siding with the Poles,

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.806
but he found little support.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:22.830
London dockers went on strike
rather than load ships with rifles

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:26.626
for the Polish Army and that Trades
Union Congress threatened a general

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:28.886
strike if the British
Army intervened.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.793
However, he could not keep quiet

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:33.213
when he learned what the Russians
Kamanev and Krasin were up to

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.206
as they went around Britain.

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:39.346
Room 40 still existed or
be it in a different form

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:42.966
and British intelligence
was intercepting

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.900
and deciphering the telegrams
the Russians were sending home.

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:50.576
Lev Kamenev, the Chairman

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:51.760
of the Moscow's Soviet
was shamelessly putting

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.993
out revolutionary propaganda.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:59.793
Fitz was so incensed that he berated
Lloyd George early in August at one

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:00.703
of the last dinner parties
of the London season.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:03.740
It was at Lord Silverman's
house in Belgrade Square.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.340
The dinner was not as lavish as Lord
Silverman had thrown before the war.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:09.860
There were fewer courses with
less food sent untasted back

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:13.976
to the kitchen, and the
table decoration was simpler.

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:16.623
The food was served by
maids instead of footmen.

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:22.156
No one wanted to be
a footman these days.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:22.480
Fitz guessed those extravagant
Edwardian parties were gone

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.680
for good.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.123
However, Silverman was still able
to attract the most powerful men

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:32.236
in the land to his house.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:35.676
Lloyd George asked Fitz
about his sister Maude.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:37.666
That was another topic
that enraged Fitz.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.303
"I'm sorry to say that she's
married a German and gone

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.656
to live in Berlin," he said.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:44.990
"I heard that" said Lloyd George.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:51.056
"I just wondered how she was
getting on, delightful young woman."

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.880
The Prime Minister's liking

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:57.280
for delightful young women was
well known, not to say notorious.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:58.683
On another subject,
Prime Minister said Fitz,

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.810
"This fellow Kamenev
is a Jew Bolshevik.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.046
You ought to deport him."

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:06.336
The Prime Minister was in
mellow mood with a glass

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:09.356
of champagne in his hand.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:10.106
"My dear Fitz," he said amiably,
"The government is not very worried

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:17.406
about Russian misinformation
which is crude and violent.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:17.726
Please don't underestimate
the British working class.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.333
They know clock trap
when they hear it.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:27.886
Believe me Kaminev's speeches are
doing more to discredit Bolshevism

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.906
than anything you or I could say."

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.066
Fitz thought this was
complacent rubbish.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.026
He had even given money
to the Daily Herald.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.290
It is this discourteous, I
agree, for a foreign government

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.553
to subsidize one of
our own newspapers.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:42.586
But really, are we
frightened of the Daily Herald?

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.423
It's not as if we Liberals and
Conservatives didn't have papers

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:52.790
of our own, but he's contacting the
most hardline revolutionary groups

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.783
in this country, maniacs
dedicated to the overthrow

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.933
of our entire way of life.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:00.476
The more the British get
to know about Bolshevism,

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:04.490
the less they will like it.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:05.890
You mark my words.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:11.490
It's formidable only when seen it at
distance through impenetrable mists.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.200
Bolshevism is almost a
safeguard to British society,

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.146
but it infects all classes with
a horror of what may happen

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.906
if the present organization
of society is overturned.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.320
I just don't like it.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.120
Besides, Lloyd George went on.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:27.426
"If we throw them out, we may have

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:29.313
to explain how we know
what they're up to?

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:32.640
And the news that was spying on them
may inflame working class opinion

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.573
against us more effectively than
all of their turgid speeches."

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:42.083
Fitz did not want to continue to be
lectured on political realities even

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:46.146
by the Prime Minister and he
persisted with his argument

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.966
because he felt so angry.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:54.396
"But surely, we don't have
to trade with the Bolsheviks.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.856
If we refuse to do business with all
those who use their embassies here

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:58.333
for propaganda, we wouldn't
have many trading partners left.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.593
Come, come, Fitz.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.593
We trade with cannibals
in the Solomon Islands."

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:05.593
Fitz was not sure that was true.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.103
The cannibals of the Solomon
Islands did not have much to offer

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:11.950
after all, but he let it pass.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:16.016
"Are we so badly off that we
have to sell to these murderers?"

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:17.870
"I fear we are.

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:20.796
I've talked to good many businessmen
and they have rather frightened me

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.276
about the next 18 months.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:25.610
There are no orders coming in.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:26.943
Customers won't buy.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:29.410
We may be in for the worst
period of unemployment that any

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:30.356
of us have ever known,
but the Russians want

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.663
to buy and they pay in gold."

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.750
"I would not take their gold."

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:39.236
"Ah, but Fitz," said Lloyd George.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:39.706
"You have so much of your own."

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.040
[Laughter] Thank you.

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:44.890
[ Applause ]

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:46.890
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:49.890


00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.210
I'll say one more thing about
that 'cause people often ask me

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.923
about the dividing
line between fiction

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.256
and real history in
stories like this.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:05.150
And in that little scene, obviously,
there's a fictional character, Fitz,

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:05.840
having a conversation with a real
historical person David Lloyd George

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:10.823
and the way I handled that was that
everything that Lloyd George said

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:17.656
in that conversation was
something that he did actually say

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:18.360
in other circumstances
on that topic.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:20.856
He wrote, in fact, the long
memo about the visit to England

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:24.153
of Kamenev and Krasin, and
he said all of those things

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:26.623
about Bolshevism being best
seen through impenetrable mists.

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:30.950
He said all of those
things in the memo.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:35.816
So his side of the
conversation is all accurate stuff

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:37.516
that he would have said
in that conversation

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:41.096
and did actually say in a memo.

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.230
Gentleman here has a question.

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:48.630
&gt;&gt; Yes. In the recently produced
television series based on Pillars

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:52.650
of the Earth, there are quite
a few changes in the TV version

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.233
than as compared to the book,

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:59.300
not the least of which was
completely ignoring the King Henry

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.280
II-Becket controversy which
did not provide for the last--

00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:11.270
dramatic last line in your book
where Philip was handed the cane

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:16.143
to take part of Henry's punishment.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.926
My question is which of the changes
do you most regret them having made

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:28.316
[laughter] and how many
fist fights did you get

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:28.643
into [laughter] with
the screenwriters?

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:31.706
And have you learned something
that's gonna be different

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.926
from when they put on
the World Without End?

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:44.020
&gt;&gt; Well, you know, they tell a
story in pictures and I tell a story

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:44.463
in words, and so I
know from the outset

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:47.530
that when they make a miniseries,
they're gonna change it.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:50.903
They have to change it.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:52.000
There was-- in the miniseries-- in
the book it was clear, for example.

00:17:56.140 --> 00:18:00.540
It was clear why Regan had such a
hold over her son William Hamley.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.090
Now, I don't think that was
difficult to understand in the book,

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:10.990
but on TV they felt that
they needed a shorthand way

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.026
of making her hold clear.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.666
So they invented an incestuous
relationship between the two

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:16.470
which wasn't in the book and I
didn't particularly like that.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:22.036
If there was anything,
I mildly regretted

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:25.730
that because it didn't
seem quite right to me,

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:29.143
but I understood why
they had to do it.

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:29.806
And the ending I also understood
even at eight hours, there was--

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:33.103
the miniseries of Pillars
was eight hours,

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:37.963
even at that length
it's very much reduced

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.043
from the book there's an awful
lot in the book that isn't

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:41.536
in the miniseries, and I could
see why it made much more sense

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:46.830
to end it in King's Bridge.

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:50.430
If they went into the whole
Becket-Henry II's story,

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.640
it would take, you know, they
would have need another hour

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:57.083
and it would have taken the story--

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:02.220
it takes the story sort of
into a new area and I could see

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.320
that in trying to economize,
they chose to leave that out.

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:09.113
And I thought the ending that they
had actually worked quite well.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.153
I didn't-- if you read the book, you
might have missed the Becket story,

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.486
but if you didn't read the
book, I think you would think

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:16.220
that was quite a satisfactory
ending.

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:18.020
So I'm not upset about it at all.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:20.933
In fact, I was really pleased
with the miniseries, good script,

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:23.846
great actors, well directed, and
most of the people that I've talked

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.386
to here who watched it in
July and August when it was

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.880
on Stars here have really
enjoyed so I'm pleased.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.580
What's your question ma'am?

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:35.113
&gt;&gt; Well, I just want a say on that.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.180
I have to say I didn't know
you as an author before.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:39.603
I actually saw the miniseries which
I loved and found fascinating.

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:43.290
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:46.156
&gt;&gt; And I actually loved it and
now I wanna read your books.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:47.290
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.290
&gt;&gt; So I'm the reverse of that.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:51.290
&gt;&gt; Okay good.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.490
&gt;&gt; But my question to you is when
you write what's your process?

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:56.290
Do you get up in the morning--

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:56.956
I mean, and start writing
in the morning?

00:19:58.290 --> 00:19:59.756
Do you write at night?

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:01.956
Do you write over a year?

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.156
Well we call it garage here.

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:04.690
I'm not sure what you call it there.

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:07.290
But--

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:09.290
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:20.113
&gt;&gt; What's your process?

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000


00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:14.290
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm a morning person.

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:16.356
I like to start early and I don't
like to work in the evening.

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:17.556
So I usually-- I usually
wake up with the next bit

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:18.556
of the story very much on my mind.

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:22.623
And really, all I want to do is
get on with writing the next scene

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:22.690
that I-- so I don't
even get dressed.

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:25.846
I put on a bathrobe and I
make tea because as, you know,

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:26.800
Brits can't do anything without tea.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.400
[ Laughter ]

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:30.800
&gt;&gt; You got that-- he's got it right.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.533
&gt;&gt; I take my mug of tea
to my desk and I often--

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.136
I'm usually writing by about 7
o'clock in the morning and then

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:37.913
with the usual breaks for things
like shaving and walking the dog.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:42.410
I usually work through 'til
about 5 o'clock in the afternoon,

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.416
then I do business for an hour.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.283
I do e-mails and phone calls.

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:51.403
And then at 6 o'clock I quite

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:52.463
like to have a glass of
champagne [laughter].

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:55.036
&gt;&gt; Perfect [laughter].

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:56.570
&gt;&gt; Or two.

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:58.570
[ Laughter ]

00:20:59.570 --> 00:20:59.703
&gt;&gt; And that's my working method.

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:02.036
Sebastian Faulks wrote
the James Bond.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.036
You know, the latest James Bond
book was written by Sebastian Faulks

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:05.946
and he looked up-- in Fleming's
working method which was to write

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:10.073
for a couple of hours in the
morning, go scuba diving,

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:16.513
have a cocktail, have lunch, take
a nap, go scuba diving again,

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:19.110
write a little more, have some more
cocktails, and then have dinner

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.483
and Sebastian Faulks said, "I
followed that routine exactly except

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:25.400
for the cocktails and
the scuba diving."

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:27.860
[ Laughter ]

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:29.860
&gt;&gt; That's--

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:31.860
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.726
&gt;&gt; What's your question sir?

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.126
&gt;&gt; Yes [inaudible].

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:37.926
Thank you, I've enjoyed
your books ever since--

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:39.860
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.593
&gt;&gt; A Place Called Freedom.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.860
And I wanna know, what's the
best advice you've ever received

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:45.860
as a writer?

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:47.860
&gt;&gt; Let me see.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.193
My agent once read one of
my early books and said--

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:50.993
none of these people has a past.

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:53.460
And I thought about
that for a long time

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:55.193
and that was a very good criticism.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:57.096
One of the faults with my early
books that weren't successful was

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:04.556
that people had no life
outside the story and I realized

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:06.260
that people have to have
a life outside the story

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.600
to seem real to the reader.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.846
Obviously, you're focused
in the danger there--

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.136
they're in at the moment or
whatever their fears and hopes are

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:16.486
at the moment, but you sort of need
to say, you know, about a character

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:20.863
and what their mom and dad were like
and what kind of childhood they had

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:23.276
and when was, you know, what was
it like the first time they had sex

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:27.693
and all that, you know, all
these really important things

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.526
about our lives.

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.096
You need to think about them and
you need to know and you need

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:33.823
to say something about
that for the character

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:35.356
to seem real, so that
was good advice.

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:37.890
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:39.890
&gt;&gt; Yes sir.

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:42.623
&gt;&gt; Hi. In Eye of the Needle,
what did Die Nedal mean by--

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:46.356
at the end of his messages
he wrote regards to Willy.

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:47.956
What did that mean?

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:51.490
&gt;&gt; Oh, it was a kind
of cheeky joke by him.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.013
I said this is long time
ago by the way [laughter].

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:00.536
I wrote that book 33 years ago.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.813
But the head of German intelligence,
the head of the Abwehr,

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:09.210
was called Wilhelm Canaris and
so regards to Willy was regard

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.920
to Wilhelm Canaris, the head
of the naval intelligence.

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:16.353
Of course, the Kaiser's
name was also Wilhelm

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:21.486
so it might have been a
little bit of subversive--

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:22.773
a little undermining of the Kaiser.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:24.660
But anyway, it was meant to show
that he was very independent

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.620
and he didn't [inaudible]
to anybody.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.516
Ma'am, what's your question?

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:35.250
&gt;&gt; I love Pillars of the
Earth and I was just wondering

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:39.116
with all the research you
did on building a cathedral

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:43.570
and also writing the sequel has
shift you on religion change?

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.880
&gt;&gt; Well, no, not really.

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:52.163
That was one of those things that I
made my mind up about as a teenager,

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:54.790
you know, when I was about 17 or 18.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:55.453
But the interesting thing
about writing the Pillars

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:01.846
of the Earth was it-- although
I'm not religious, and I'm--

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:05.216
partly because of my very
religious upbringing.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:07.130
I'm kind of hostile to
all that kind of thing.

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:10.840
In writing the Pillars of the
Earth, it was about the building--

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.100
building a church so,
clearly, there had to be

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:18.790
in that story some sympathetic
characters whose view

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:18.870
of religion was different from mine.

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:23.396
And so Prior Philip was really one

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.693
of the most difficult
characters for me to write ever.

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:27.986
And for one thing, he's
cheerfully celibate.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.760
I've never written a character
[laughter] who was celibate

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.573
and happy about it before.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.640
And clearly, he had to be--

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:40.476
Prior Philip had to be
a very sincere Christian

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:47.496
and so I modeled him on the kind
of Christians that-- that I admire.

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:48.040
In our political life,
Barbara, my wife and I have--

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:54.906
we often worked with clergymen and
their agenda is the same as ours.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:55.456
They're concerned or some of
them are concerned about material

00:24:58.810 --> 00:24:59.100
and spiritual poverty
in their congregation

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.503
and that's basically the
agenda of the Labour Party

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.670
that Barbara and I belong to, so.

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:06.313
We worked with clergymen and
I modeled Philip on the kind

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.626
of clergymen that I really admire.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:15.163
Philip, you'll notice, never says
to anybody you're suffering now,

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:18.323
but it'll be alright in
the afterlife in heaven.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:18.976
He always tries to solve
their problems here and now.

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:25.743
He's a very practical Christian
in that respect and the kind

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:26.673
that I've often come
across and admire,

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:32.473
and I'll finish answering the
question by telling you about a monk

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:37.113
who came up to me at a book
fair in Switzerland in Basel,

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:37.510
German language, book fair in Basel.

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:40.320
But this guy spoke very good English
and he came up to me and said,

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:47.140
"I love the Pillars of the
Earth and all my brothers

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:48.566
in the monastery also
loved the book."

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:50.896
And I said, "I'm very
pleased to hear that."

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:52.343
Although a little surprised
because I feel

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:55.250
that it's not really
a very spiritual book.

00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:58.716
It's about the material
problems of building a cathedral

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:04.850
and Prior Philip is a very practical
Christian and not really a very--

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:05.873
he's not interested in theology.

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:08.480
He's in a way not very spiritual
and this monk said, "Yes,

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:10.933
that's why we like him so much."

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:13.800
[ Laughter ]

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.733
&gt;&gt; So I guess I pleased them.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.533
Sir, what's your question?

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.050
&gt;&gt; Vince [inaudible] good
to see you in person here.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:21.950
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:25.350
&gt;&gt; I just wanna say The Man from
St. Petersburg is my favorite book

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:26.293
that you wrote and it was
probably one of your earlier ones.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:28.540
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:30.206
&gt;&gt; And it was just
such a fantastic book.

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:33.273
I rated it in my top five.

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.540
Thank you.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.073
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:38.273
That was my fourth
book written in about--

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:40.606
I guess in about 1981,
1982, and I'm very glad.

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:42.806
I'm very pleased that
people are still reading it.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:45.340
What's your question ma'am?

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:45.806
&gt;&gt; Hi. So you're raising a trilogy

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:48.940
of about five families
that's for this very century.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:50.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:51.940
&gt;&gt; I was wondering,
how do you manage

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.540
to keep all the different pieces
of the story and the details

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:55.806
in your mind while you're writing?

00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.206
&gt;&gt; With great difficulty.

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.966
[Laughter] It's-- so first of all
I'm writing it one book at a time.

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:05.313
I have a general outline of
the whole three, but that's--

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:10.740
it's pretty vague and I've realized
that if I wrote a detailed outline

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:15.163
for the whole trilogy it might
take me years and I kind of--

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:19.660
I didn't want to spend that
long without writing something

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:20.613
that you guys could read, you know,

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.946
'cause an outline is
only for me to read.

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:27.690
So I wrote the Fall of Giants.

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:33.416
I finished it, and then I
started on the outline for book 2

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:34.356
and I've written about a
hundred pages of book 2 now.

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:38.696
The other thing I do,
I've done recently,

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:39.216
and I found it very helpful,
I never used to do this,

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:45.263
but I make a spreadsheet
in Excel on my computer

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:50.943
and every time I introduce a new
named character, I put the character

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:55.676
on the spreadsheet with his age or
her age, and any description I paste

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.613
into the spreadsheet and that
really helps me keep track.

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:00.173
I never used to do
this and it might be

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:02.933
because I'm writing longer
books now or it might be

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.706
because I'm getting older

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.640
and I don't remember things
quite as well as I used to.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:08.486
But anyway, I found
that very helpful.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:10.983
And of course, the outline
that I write before I start

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:13.533
to write chapter 1 says what
happens in every chapter,

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:15.473
and says who the characters are.

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.806
So that also helps
me keep hold on it.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:20.103
And finally, the other thing
I do which I find helpful

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:27.243
in a funny way is, early in
the story, I cut out pictures

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:31.126
from magazines and art books,
and so on, of people who look

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:33.176
like the characters
that I've got in my mind

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.290
and I stick all these
pictures up on a big board.

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:39.426
So when I'm writing, I can look at
the board and I can see the faces

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:45.486
of the characters more or less
as I imagine them and I find

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.673
that that really helps
to make them vivid to me.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.940
So one way or another, I just
about managed to keep track.

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.580
So what's your question?

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:56.380
We better-- we do these
two questions

00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:59.846
and then I have to go, but--

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:00.646
&gt;&gt; It's actually a
very similar question.

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:02.456
I was just gonna ask if you have any
advice for aspiring writers of how

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:08.770
to balance many, many,
many story lines,

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.933
just kind of juggling
them all at once.

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:15.696
&gt;&gt; Well, that is quite
difficult and it's important to--

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:19.863
not to make the scenes too
short, not to jump from one

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:24.996
to the other too quickly
but also if you leave one

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:26.803
of the story lines untouched
for 100 pages then we've got

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:29.900
to remember the readers
probably forgotten about it.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:35.186
So, I mean my touch stone
in all these questions--

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:42.036
my touch stone is that the reader
must be emotionally engaged.

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:47.270
And that's all you need to do,
you know, if the reader cares,

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:52.526
if the reader is happy or sad,
or anxious or angry, indignant,

00:29:55.740 --> 00:30:00.406
anything, then he or she will turn
the page and read what happens next.

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:05.036
&gt;&gt; You have to-- whatever
you do, you have to have

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:05.333
that emotional engagement
and if you don't have it,

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:09.620
then no matter how good the book, no
matter how well written the book is,

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:11.973
how intelligent, how clever, if the
reader isn't emotionally engaged,

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:16.326
then it's gonna be
quite hard to read.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:22.753
So in answering that question, I
don't have very good specific advice

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:25.650
about balancing storylines,

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:26.913
but my underlying advice
would be the only thing

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.653
that matters is are
you making people care

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:31.470
about what's happening
to these people or not.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:34.336
And if you're not, then you're doing
something wrong and if you are,

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:38.216
then it's probably
gonna be a bestseller.

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:40.550
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:43.083
&gt;&gt; Last question Madam.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:44.560
&gt;&gt; It's interesting to hear
that you formed a visual image

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:47.190
of the person 'cause we
do that too as readers

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:48.756
and it would be interesting that--

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:51.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:52.890
&gt;&gt; But my question
is about research,

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:56.556
when you're researching historical
events, I mean that's easy,

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:56.890
but how do you research perspective?

00:30:58.490 --> 00:30:58.916
How do you research the American
perspective to World War I

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:03.663
as opposed to the Russian?

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:04.863
&gt;&gt; Well, on that question,
it's very useful--

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:06.663
I start with general history
books, but what I find

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:12.796
so valuable are things like diaries
that people wrote at the time

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:18.293
or memoirs of ordinary people, or
letters home, there are quite a lot

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:25.303
of collections of letters home
from men who were fighting

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.006
in the trenches, home to their
wives and girlfriends, and mothers

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.966
and fathers, and that tells
you the real everyday.

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:33.736
That gives you the
everyday feel of it, I mean,

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:35.350
talk about perspective, you know.

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:41.016
That's the man who is actually
sitting in that muddy trench

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:41.816
with a pencil and a piece of
paper writing home to his mother.

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:44.513
That will give you the real feel
of what it must have been like

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:52.266
or a diary that he wrote
everyday sitting in his dugout.

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:56.230
That's the kind of material
that's most valuable to me.

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:58.656
Thanks everybody for coming.
