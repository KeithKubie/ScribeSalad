miles away from where we're going by
 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.120
miles away from where we're going by
plane and then the rest of the way we

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130
plane and then the rest of the way we
 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.150
plane and then the rest of the way we
need to go on snow machines hauling

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160

sleds with some of our gear we are right
at the edge of the peninsula so we'll be

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800
at the edge of the peninsula so we'll be
 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.610
at the edge of the peninsula so we'll be
traveling over sea ice for the next

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620
traveling over sea ice for the next
 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.969

coming together let's be moved by the
 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.749
coming together let's be moved by the
tides and by the wind and it's a little

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759
tides and by the wind and it's a little
 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.790
tides and by the wind and it's a little
bit dangerous but we've mitigate those

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800
bit dangerous but we've mitigate those
 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.300
bit dangerous but we've mitigate those
dangers by making a good plan and taking

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310
dangers by making a good plan and taking
 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.890
