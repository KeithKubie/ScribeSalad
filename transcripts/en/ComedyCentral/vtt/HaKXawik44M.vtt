OK guys, in my pocket I have
some Broken Lizard trivia

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:07.606
questions.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.276
Whoever answers these questions
correctly is going to walk

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.245
on part in the next movie.

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:13.112
Exciting, right?

00:00:13.145 --> 00:00:14.280
OK, here we go.

00:00:14.313 --> 00:00:16.783
Shitface, you're first.

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:18.684
The first question is a
"Super Troopers" question.

00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:20.319
Have you seen "Super Troopers?"
-Oh yeah.

00:00:20.352 --> 00:00:21.254
All right, you're
going to great.

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:22.522
You're going to do great.

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:26.392
All right, Shitface,
between Kevin and Steve,

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:30.496
which of us would
you rather [bleep]?

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.633
[laughter]

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.836
Don't shout out the answer.

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:42.241
Which of us would
you rather [bleep]?

00:00:42.274 --> 00:00:43.409
Shitface?

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:44.544
I want a mustache ride.

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:45.545
I'm going with this
guy right here.

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:47.513
There you go.

00:00:47.546 --> 00:00:49.816
I feel a little
hurt by that, but--

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:56.722
By the way, Shitface,
that answer is correct.

00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:58.424
One nothing Shitface.

00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:00.426
All right, Sugar
Tits, you're up buddy.

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:02.528
Your question is a
"Beerfest" question.

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:03.763
Have you seen "Beerfest"?
-Absolutely.

00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:05.198
You're going to do great man.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:06.232
You're going to do great.

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:09.769
Sugar Tits, between Kevin
and Steve, which of us

00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:14.640
would you let [bleep] you?

00:01:14.673 --> 00:01:16.042
It's a little different.

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:19.512
Which of us would
you let [bleep] you?

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:21.414
Sugar Tits, before you
answer this question,

00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:22.715
I would just like
to say to all of you

00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:25.585
that this game was way
better with chicks.

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:27.186
[laughter]

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:28.454
Good game with chicks.

00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:29.455
A lot of fun with girls.

00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:31.257
Very good game with chicks.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.158
OK, but we make do.

00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:35.094
OK, Sugar Tits,
what's it going to be.

00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:36.329
Steve.

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:37.396
Oh, [bleep] yeah.

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.732
What the [bleep]
is going on here?

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:42.298
I think he's afraid
of falling in love.
