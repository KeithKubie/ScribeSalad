really good and I also like the fact

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130
really good and I also like the fact
 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.670

robotic arm because otherwise they'd

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930
robotic arm because otherwise they'd
 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.330
robotic arm because otherwise they'd
just be like oh they're in our world

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340
just be like oh they're in our world
 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.580

else there it looks like our world but
 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.870
else there it looks like our world but
the robotic arm still shows what

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880
the robotic arm still shows what
 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.120
the robotic arm still shows what
something's up something's that this

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130
something's up something's that this
 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.450

and there he saw himself but he had that
 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.010
and there he saw himself but he had that
robotic arm in the this rocks a clue he

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020
robotic arm in the this rocks a clue he
 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.930
robotic arm in the this rocks a clue he
had the remote

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940
had the remote
 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.690

Shamir coming to really the fact that's

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700
Shamir coming to really the fact that's
 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.730
Shamir coming to really the fact that's
the right arm possibly cuz it was the

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740
the right arm possibly cuz it was the
 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.890
the right arm possibly cuz it was the
right arm in the mirror it's the right

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900
right arm in the mirror it's the right
 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.650
right arm in the mirror it's the right
arm here yeah it's the exact same image

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660
arm here yeah it's the exact same image
 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.390
arm here yeah it's the exact same image
that was in the mirror yeah and don't

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400
that was in the mirror yeah and don't
 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.230
that was in the mirror yeah and don't
you say that mirrors are a gateway to

by with it yeah mmm the cosmic owl said
 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:15.940
by with it yeah mmm the cosmic owl said
so okay um and yeah so I really that's

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:15.950
so okay um and yeah so I really that's
 

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.320
so okay um and yeah so I really that's
like the one element where you can't

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:17.330
like the one element where you can't
 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:18.760
like the one element where you can't
just be like oh they're in reality

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:18.770
just be like oh they're in reality

you're like oh a parallel universe and
 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.780
you're like oh a parallel universe and
we're the other universe whatever but by

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:25.790
we're the other universe whatever but by
 

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.430
we're the other universe whatever but by
having a robotic arm it's just all the

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440
having a robotic arm it's just all the
 

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.050
having a robotic arm it's just all the
more wait what is that

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:29.060
more wait what is that
 

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.870
more wait what is that
well what's going on with that um so

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:31.880
well what's going on with that um so
 

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.930
well what's going on with that um so
yeah I really enjoyed it I like uh I

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:34.940
yeah I really enjoyed it I like uh I
 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.640
yeah I really enjoyed it I like uh I
liked sorry this uncomfortable feeling

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:36.650
liked sorry this uncomfortable feeling
 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.650
liked sorry this uncomfortable feeling
throughout the whole thing and I like

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:38.660
throughout the whole thing and I like
 

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.110
throughout the whole thing and I like
the imagery and I thought it came across

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120
