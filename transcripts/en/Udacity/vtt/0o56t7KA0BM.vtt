00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The answer is we should, and this is related to the homework problem on Unit 4

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
where we saw that you could forge an RSA signature by multiplying two signatures.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In this case, the message that's being signed might be used to produce other messages.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We need to be very careful when we output the result of RSA decryptions.

00:00:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We might be signing something different from what we think we're signing.
