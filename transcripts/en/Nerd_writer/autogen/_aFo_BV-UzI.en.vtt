00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.160
 But is not it wrong to discriminate against people based on their religion? 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.540
 But, Jamie, the problem 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.500
 Uh, I mean, I'm with her 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.020
 But, see ... 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.640
 There are people coming to our country 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.680
 They want to do a lot of damage 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.880
 You look at 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.440
 Look at Paris 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.620
 Look at what happened in Paris. 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.420
 I mean, these people, they did not come from Sweden 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.160
 Concept? 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.700
 Look at what happened in Paris 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.640
 And what happened in California last week 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.460
 With ... with, you know, fourteen dead people 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.840
 The others will die 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.520
 They are badly infected 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.120
 We have a serious problem. 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.500
 There is tremendous hatred abroad. 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.280
 - And what I want to do is to know what 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.980
 You know, you can not solve a problem 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.680
 So you know the root cause 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.440
 I want to know what the problem is 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.360
 what is happening 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.580
 This is temporary. 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.360
 I had a lot of people call me and say thank you. 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.780
 Now, as you remember, when you did it a week ago 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.980
 It was like chaos. 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:52.700
 Suddenly.. 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.040
 And you watched last night 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.380
 And I saw them talking 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.640
 They say, "Well, Trump has a point 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.680
 We have to get to the problem. " 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.700
 Friends who Accidentally, 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.200
 They said 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.440
 "Donald, I've done our tremendous service, 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.640
 Because we have a problem 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.820
 - And we must know what 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.040
 And we have to know what you are - you might have been phone dumps 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.280
 Those were probably telephone dumps-no-no 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.060
 One of the charming things I found in Donald Trump 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.700
 Is how his language is used 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.980
 Different from the other candidates for the political post 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.240
 Especially the President of the United States 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.760
 While his opponents and the political class generally seem more aware that 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.980
 Their words will be picked up and used against them 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.060
 Trump deliberately underestimates this fact 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.980
 As a lifelong seller, he has a bargaining talent to sell feeling 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.740
 Even if the ideas and facts that confirm that they are false or racist or unclear 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.840
 So I think it would be obvious to take a look at Trump answers to simple questions 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.240
 In this case Jimmy Kimmel asked Trump whether it was wrong to discriminate against people based on their religion 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.480
 In reference to a temporary proposal to block all Muslims from entering the United States 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.520
 220 words, exactly one minute to answer 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.800
 I think, a bunch of things that Trump is using all the time in his speech 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.320
 The first thing to know is how simple this language is 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.480
 Of the 220 words, 172, or 78%, in one section 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.420
 They often come in a rhythmic series like a ball of footage ending with one of his buzzwords 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.920
 "We must get to the problem" 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.460
 39 words, or 17%, are two long sections 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:37.040
 Only 4 words have three sections, 3 of which are massive, massive, and massive 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.600
 And only two words are of 4 long clips 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.340
 California, was forced to use it because it contained a lower section than San Bernardino 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.920
 And temporarily, it is devouring 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.880
 "And temporarily, I had a lot of people .." 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.260
 This stop interferes with a study done by Boston Hearts 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.420
 Which laid out all the presidential candidates' 2016 presidential candidates 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.140
 Through the Fleisch-Kinkaid readability test to determine their grade level classifications 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.820
 Donald Trump's speech came in fourth place from reading level 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.240
 By reference, between Carson came in sixth 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.900
 Hillary Clinton and the Bush-Kanu pocket speak eighth in the reading level 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.560
 Bernie Sanders was in high school, in the second year, to be exact 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.540
 Now this is not just for choosing a word or clip 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.820
 It's about syntax as well 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.340
 Trump's favorite simple sentences like: 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.900
 "We have a real problem there, there is a huge number of hatred" 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.020
 The sentence is rarely used as complex or independent sentences 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.060
 He also prefers the second person most of the time, addressing listeners clearly with commands 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.380
 "Look at Paris, look at what happened in Paris, look at what happened in Paris, see what happened in California last week" 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.140
 Or involve us in what he will say as if we have already agreed 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.600
 "And you saw yesterday, and I saw people talking" 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:58.140
 Is really wonderful in this, framing the negative response as an overreaction that was later recognized as such 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.400
 "As I remember, when I did this a week ago it was like chaos 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.880
 Suddenly .. - You saw yesterday, and I saw people talking 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.700
 They say, "Well, Trump has a point, we have to get to the problem." 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.080
 Perhaps the most important method used by Trump and do it better than anyone I have heard 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.240
 Is to end his sentence with strong words 

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:22.380
 Many times the sentence is initially arranged inappropriately, to enable it to end strongly 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.480
 For example, here, perhaps it would be natural to say 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.540
 You can not solve a problem until you find what is the root cause of it 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.980
 But it brings them at the beginning to finish on the root cause 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.300
 He does the same here 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.760
 He seems to have done the same thing before Kimmel passes it 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.900
 For these final words are important 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.440
 They are routed and categorized together to draw the whole subject of the answer 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.580
 "Damage, death, death, serious injury, problem, root cause 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.140
 Thank you, mess, point, problem, service, problem " 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.420
 In a sense, these are the words that the audience remembers 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.320
 Especially when the rest of the speech is incoherent 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.200
 Like the best seller, Trump keeps it simple, he repeats a lot 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.620
 "We have a real problem, what is the problem 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.040
 We have a problem, the problem must be reached " 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.740
 He uses his favorite word repeatedly 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.960
 "Massive, tremendous, tremendous service" 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.100
 He always seems to have friends who are part of the group he is currently violating 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.320
 They talk to him and thank him for excellence 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.240
 "Many of them have happened to me and they said, Did you know, Donald? You're right, we have a problem and I see there's a problem." 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.080
 Donald Trump knows when it sounds painful or strong ... 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.240
 He has a good comic instinct, you can even call him a comic 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.040
 But you can not give him intelligence or knowledge 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.980
 The best seller may sell you a TV without knowing anything about it 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.740
 Because television does not matter 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.020
 Important, it is you. 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.580
 And if you are an American citizen, for years 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.940
 The politicians may have listened to the sound of sophistication while doing nothing 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.060
 You may be just getting ready for something 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.040
 That's not all. 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.180
 But next time if I feel that Donald Trump has a point 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.160
 Do yourself a service 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.320
 And look at his words. 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.600
 Hi everyone, Thanks for watching. I want to point you in the direction of my friends, Wise Crack 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.960
 They did a great job, and fantastic article videos. If you like what you have, you will certainly 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:27.140
 She likes what they do. They talk about books, movies, and my favorite personally is the 8-bit philosophy 

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:32.860
 It is like philosophy illustrated with Nintendo graphics. Very good. I wish I had thought about it. 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:38.240
 Anyway, go to them, sign up, watch a clip, if you want to help me as usual. 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.780
 You can click here, and donate $ 1, 2, 3, or $ 5 to my channel. 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.580
