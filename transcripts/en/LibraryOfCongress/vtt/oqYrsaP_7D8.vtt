00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:21.510
&gt;&gt; Please welcome to our stage,
Carla Hayden and David Ferriero.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.510
[ Music ]

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:42.670
[ Clapping ]

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:43.970
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Well --

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.680
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
How have you been?

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.800
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: We call
ourselves partners in crime.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.170
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: We are
though we're not going to talk

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.290
about the crime part
of it, right?

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.190
[Laughter] We're just going to
talk about the partner part.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.900
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Well, what's
been really interesting

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.700
since I've been in the position

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.790
of Library [inaudible] is the
fact that people ask me well,

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.600
what does the National
Archives do?

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.380
You know --

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.680
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
What do you mean?

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.980
What does that mean?

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.650
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: What
does the archivist do?

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.820
You're the Library of Congress.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.140
And then this -- there's a
confusion about the histories

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.960
and the roles of each
of the institutions.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.940
And I've learned a lot in that
even about the tank coming

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.390
up to reclaim the
Declaration of Independence,

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.670
the Bill of Rights,
and was there a third?

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.240
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: We
call it the Constitution.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.470
[ Laughter ]

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.700
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: That were
held by the Library of Congress

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.000
and that type of thing.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.300
So could you --

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.350
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Well you got
an earlier start than we did.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.540
It wasn't until the 1930s

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.870
that the United States got
serious about its record.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.360
And it was Franklin Roosevelt
who was passionate about records

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.490
that we actually created the --

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.690
he signed the legislation that
created the National Archives.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.540
The charters that Carla
is referring to had been

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.670
in the custody of the
State Department and then

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.260
at the Library of Congress.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.860
And when the Archives
building was built,

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.890
a beautiful tabernacle
was created

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.950
for the Declaration
of Independence.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.700
Doors opened in 1935 but the
librarian of Congress refused

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.060
to release the Declaration.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.100
[ Laughter ]

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.770
And I've held that against
you [laughter] ever since.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.070
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
I wasn't born then

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.510
but I knew this was
going to happen.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.690
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: And it
wasn't until Harry Truman came

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.180
into office that he, you know,
kind of laid down the law

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.230
with the new librarian of
Congress that they really needed

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.180
to deliver that document
where it belonged.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.880
So as Carla describes it, it
was a really military ceremony

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.530
with tanks and military people
lining the steps of the --

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.520
and she claims she always
describes it as a grab

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.290
for the Declaration
[laughter] but it --

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.590
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
Tanks literally --

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.890
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: -- was the
only transfer of the document

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.630
to its rightful place.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.400
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And
we have photographs.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.700
Photographs --

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.000
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: We do.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.300
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
-- of the people.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.170
The tanks with the
-- what are those?

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.470
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Howitzers.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.290
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yes.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.060
[Laughter] Right there waiting
and you can imagine the curators

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.020
and the librarians thinking
well maybe it's time.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.360
And who was the librarian
of the Congress then?

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.660
Do you remember?

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.960
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Oh I forget.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.260
Someone here must remember.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.560
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Someone here.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.860
Winston Tab is here.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.160
He is my check on all the time.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.460
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Oh Winston.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.760
You were here.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.060
What was the --

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.360
[ Laughter ]

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.430
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: But that
was the start of the kind

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.010
of clarification of roles and
to really divide up things.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.340
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: The
Archives was created to collect

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.590
and protect and made
available the records

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.020
of the United States government.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.850
So anything that was
created by the government.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.880
So the question -- the natural
question is what about the stuff

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.460
that was created before 1934
when the legislation was signed?

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.140
A lot of it is in our custody.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.820
Some of it is at the
Library of Congress.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.770
Since the materials were stored
in attics and basements all

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.370
over town, a lot of it was
lost through the fire and theft

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.040
and flood but what we have
now is a dividing line

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.130
between everything
the government creates

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.200
and that's me, and everything
they don't create which is you.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.000
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And
sometimes I like to --

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.220
and there are times when
I'm glad you're you.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.980
[Laughter] I've learned that.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.350
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: And there are
times when I wish I were you.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.410
[ Laughter ]

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.990
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And I've
described it in another way too

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:01.620
that for instance, Truman and
his official records might be

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.330
with the Truman Library
and I'd really like to get

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.530
into those things too with the
Presidential Libraries and some

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.230
of the letters that he
wrote to his family.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:18.240
So the person is where you might
-- the things that the person,

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.330
the diaries, all of the things
like that, the personal part

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.260
and the personal life
of an official might be

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.740
at the Library of Congress.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.130
And so the papers
of 23 presidents

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.430
from George Washington
to Coolidge are

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.460
at the Library of Congress.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.770
And we were both in
Starkville, Mississippi.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.230
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
Starkville, Mississippi,

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.320
where Ulysses S. Grant is still
probably revolving in his grave

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.620
through [multiple speakers].

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.920
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And
the Abraham Lincoln.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.220
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Yes.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.520
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Collection.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.010
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Ulysses S.
Grant Presidential Library --

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.470
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
Library is in Starkville.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.770
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
At -- in Mississippi.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.070
Can you believe it?

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.380
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
And we were there.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.680
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: We were.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.980
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And
[multiple speakers].

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.280
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: It
turns out there are more

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.190
than 200 Presidential
sites around the country.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.070
People beyond the
Library of Congress

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.640
and the National Archives who
have some kind of responsibility

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.340
for some aspect of a President's
life and they're all meeting

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.510
in Washington in August.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.810
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And
what's interesting

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.400
about the Presidential
Libraries,

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:27.080
the Library of Congress has
custody of the actual papers

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.710
and documents of Ulysses
S. Grant and what some

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.740
of the Presidential Libraries
do is what they will collect

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.520
and make copies of things
from different collections

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.150
about a President and
put them in [inaudible].

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.450
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:44.750
Those Presidential
cites, that's right.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.050
Yes.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.350
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Place
and that's how the --

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:48.920
some of the Presidential
Libraries have --

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.220
been established.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.520
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: So when
Franklin Roosevelt created the

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.070
National Archives,
he also decided

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.500
to have a Presidential Library.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.050
So technically his
was the first --

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.220
I'm convinced he was
a closet archivist.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.990
He was really passionate
about his papers

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.280
and understood the
importance of archives.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.070
Spent a lot of time hiring the
first archivist and spent a lot

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.110
of time supporting
that first archivist,

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.640
Robert Connor [phonetic], in his
work as he was trying to figure

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.620
out where the records
are, and more importantly,

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.840
to convince the agency heads
to give up their records

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.140
because that wasn't something

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.880
that people were
interested in doing.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.960
So Roosevelt created his
own library or Herbert --

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.580
whoever decided he wanted
a library at that point

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:31.880
but this was all voluntary.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.530
It was all voluntary up
until 1972 when thanks

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.900
to President Nixon
and his thoughts

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.070
that he owned his own records
that legislation was passed,

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:44.370
the Presidential Records Act,

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.330
which made it government
property.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:52.180
So 1972 is kind of our marker
for you have to donate.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.570
You have to give your papers
to the National Archive.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.430
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And so the role
really became official then.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:59.730
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Yeah.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.220
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And then
the other departments

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:05.860
and that's another confusion
that happens sometimes.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.160
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Well
it's a separate set of laws.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.440
Presidential Records
Act was 1972.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.590
The Federal Records Act was
created much earlier than that.

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:16.160
And that guides all of the
records management activities

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.560
for the Executive Branch.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:22.300
So all of the 275 Executive
Branch Cabinet level

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.370
and agencies and departments.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.290
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: What
about congressional records

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:28.590
of [multiple speakers] --

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:29.890
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: We provide

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.890
by a gentleman's
agreement way back when,

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.850
we provide courtesy
storage for the records

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.830
of Congress and service them.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:43.360
They are the records of
Congress but they aren't

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.680
at the Library of Congress.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.980
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And you --

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.170
and I want all of the people
watching and listening

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:55.550
to realize that the joy of
working with your colleagues.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:56.850
Some that you've known.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:01.180
I've known David his time at
New York Public and all of that,

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.400
is that you have this
kind of friendly,

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.970
kind of historical
whatever competition.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:10.270
[Laughter] So when
you talk about your --

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.570
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
And some grudges.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:12.870
Still carrying --

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.170
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And grudges.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.470
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
-- some grudges.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:16.770
[Laughter]

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:18.070
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: So
when you talk about

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:19.370
and I know you've seen that
movie, National Treasure.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:20.670
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Yes.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:21.970
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: You
got all the kids.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.270
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Yes.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.570
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And they're
doing it but the Library

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.960
of Congress has that
first printing

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.840
that just had John
Hancock on it.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.520
And then they send it out.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.820
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: It wouldn't
have been that first printing

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.780
if those original signors
didn't sign something.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.080
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: See.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.380
[ Laughter ]

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.680
And --

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.980
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Which I have.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.280
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And
David Ferriero --

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.580
[laughter] right, right, okay.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.880
It's okay.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.180
It's okay.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.460
And the Gettysburg Address, you
know, that he took on the field.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.760
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: That's right.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.060
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: The contents

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.050
of Abraham Lincoln's pockets
the night he was assassinated.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.250
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
[Inaudible] I know.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.510
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Four locks
of Thomas Jefferson's hair.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:07.160
[ Laughter ]

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.460
Just saying.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:14.240
[Laughter] You know, so there
is kind of fun to have this kind

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.300
of historical back
and forth with people.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.600
Oh those Tony Marks [phonetic].

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.480
He's got a few artifacts
too at New York Public.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.780
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Yeah.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.250
The [inaudible] stolen from
the Vatican by Napoleon.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.700
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Okay.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.000
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Yeah.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.940
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: There are
a few things over there.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:35.400
So everybody's -- and let's not
even bring up Hamilton, right?

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.430
[Laughter] Let's -- okay
let's bring up Hamilton.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.550
[Inaudible] how did
you pull that off?

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.850
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
We have Hamilton's --

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.580
oh it's through the New York
Public Library actually.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.660
Tommy Kale [phonetic]
[laughter] who was the Director

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.510
of Hamilton was a
member of the Library

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:55.700
for the Performing Arts
Visiting Committee.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.760
And he and I became good
friends and when we decided

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.390
to honor Ron [inaudible]

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:04.310
and Lynn Manuel [phonetic]
it was through Tommy Kale --

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:05.900
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh
was that really good.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.000
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: -- we got
all three of them in house.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.300
Yes.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:12.920
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Well, we're
not going to name drop.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.220
Okay.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.520
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Not at all.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.820
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: We're
just going to let that go.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.120
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Not at all.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.420
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: We're
going to let that go.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:20.720
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: But we
do have Hamilton's Oath

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.020
of Allegiance signed at Valley
Forge by George Washington.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:26.590
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And [laughter]
we just digitized the last note

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.510
to his wife, Eliza.

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:34.030
[ Laughter ]

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:36.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.840
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Not yet.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.350
[ Laughter ]

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:43.150
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
It's so much fun.

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:46.330
And then you get
Tony on the side --

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:47.630
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
We have [inaudible]

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:52.920
to the government outlining
her poverty asking for support

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.280
from the federal government.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.400
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And we just
are finishing digitizing all

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.550
of her correspondence
of the rest of her life

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:04.290
when she did his -- and made
-- unburnished his reputation.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:05.590
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Yeah.

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:06.890
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
So we could go on.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.190
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: What else are
you doing in the digitization?

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.490
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: We can go on.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:10.790
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Okay.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.090
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: You just
name a historical figure.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:14.350
If they were official,
that's what you have though.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:15.650
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: That's right.

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:16.950
So what are you doing in --

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:18.670
what are we doing together
in the digitization?

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.640
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Well, we
are doing some cool stuff.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.020
Why don't you tell them
a little bit about that?

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.820
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: We're
working on the Terrific Exhibit

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:30.230
with the BNF tracing the French
role in the American Revolution.

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.090
Working with, I think
you guys are involved

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:33.390
in the New York Public Library.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.690
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: New York
Public's very involved.

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.550
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: The BNF,
Library of Congress, and the --

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.270
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And the
BNF, just in case people --

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.190
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
And another project

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:44.420
with the British
Library, George --

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:45.720
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
The two Georges.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.520
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Two
Georges about the beginnings

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.300
of this country, King
George and our King George.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.830
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: We're
calling it the two Georges

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.000
because it's their
George, George the Third,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.050
and George Washington.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:01.560
And the cool thing about it
is that they were reading some

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.000
of the same books
at the same time.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.920
They had similar interests and
so it'll be a joint exhibit

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.820
with the Royal Archives.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.120
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: That's right.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.420
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Windsor.

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.780
We didn't go to the wedding

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:19.880
but [laughter] our research
timing didn't coincide

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:24.330
but the Royal Archives,
Kings College,

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.540
and William and Mary here.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:30.990
So that type of collaboration
happens all the time

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:34.820
and we keep -- and we mentioned
Tony Marks and New York Public

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:40.260
because in terms of a public
library that has a collection

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:44.600
that complements some of the
things that we're involved in.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:48.070
New York Public is the
library that we work closely

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:49.600
with in different ways.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.890
So the burning question that
people have asked me already

00:13:54.890 --> 00:14:00.470
and it came up at a session, one
of the sessions, what do we do

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:05.280
and how do we deal with
technology going forward?

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.570
Some of the historical
records now are going to be

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:10.090
in a different format.

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:11.390
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
They already are.

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:14.680
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And you've been
really on the forefront of that

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.400
with your -- you were
putting a hard stop

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.990
on collecting in analog.

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:25.000
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: I'm sure
you've read in the press

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.830
about the President's
Reform Plan

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.980
that was just issued last week.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.810
If you go to page 103, you'll
see a two page description

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.660
of the National Archives
contribution

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.460
to that reform plan.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.530
And what it spells
out is the message

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:42.020
that we've already
delivered to the agencies

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:48.580
that we are no longer accepting
paper at the end of 2022.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.730
They have until 2022 to
get their paper to us.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:56.000
That they -- that's in their
custody now that is scheduled

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.470
to be transferred but after
2022, it's digital only.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:03.590
So the agencies have already
been prepared for this.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:07.070
They've already -- many
of them 85% of them

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:11.330
about have been already
digitizing their records.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.840
So we're in pretty
good shape that way

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.560
but the most important factor is

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.460
that those agencies are
already creating their records

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.410
electronically and they
have been for some time.

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:28.970
So this is not, you know, a
great surprise, a great shock.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:32.320
And just a data point, since
I know there are some people

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.860
who are confused about what's
going on with the Obama --

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.130
the planning for
the Obama Library.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:42.120
It turns out that more than 80%

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.460
of the Obama records
are born digital.

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.940
There is no paper equivalent.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.270
So the plan is with
the agreement

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:55.200
of the Obama Foundation that
we will create the first all

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.510
digital Presidential library.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:00.500
The money would have
been invested

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:04.850
in creating a physical
facility in Chicago is going

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:08.530
to be devoted to
digitization of that 15%

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:11.470
that isn't already digital.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.130
And that's, you know,
a very different model

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:15.500
for Presidential libraries.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:19.760
It's a very different model
for how we deliver information

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.950
and service the Presidential
records

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:24.840
but it's an exciting
opportunity for us

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:29.040
to rethink a whole new
way of communicating,

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.560
connecting with our users.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.650
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Are you going
to be borrowing some techniques

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:38.860
from museums and things in
terms of how you display --

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.610
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: The plan is

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.080
that the foundation
has already designed

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.330
and will build a museum.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:49.140
And we will loan
to them artifacts

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.180
because the Presidential
libraries are a combination

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:57.970
of paper or film, photographs,
and lots of artifacts,

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.100
gifts from foreign
heads of state,

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:03.440
gifts from the American
people, more macaroni pictures

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.180
than you've ever
seen in your life.

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.480
[Laughter]

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.780
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: The
things from children.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.080
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Yes.

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.380
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Hopefully.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:11.680
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Oh yeah.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.980
Yeah. Yeah.

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:14.280
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Okay.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.580
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Every one

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:16.880
of the Presidential libraries
has this kind of collection.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.180
So those are the kinds
of things that will end

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.480
up in the museum part of the --

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.780
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: What about
letters from young people?

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.080
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
That's part of --

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.380
those are all digitized now.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.680
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
Oh that's going --

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.980
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
They're all digitized.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.280
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
to be very cool --

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.580
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Yeah.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.880
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: --
to see all the letters

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.180
and I know that's a big part.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.480
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Well
that's important to me

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.780
because when I became
the archivist and met

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.080
with the Directors of the
Presidential libraries

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.800
for the first time that Director
of the Kennedy handed me a copy

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.180
of a letter that a kid wrote
to the President asking

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:43.060
for information about
the proposed Peace Corps.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.030
And it's a letter from me.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:47.040
[ Laughter ]

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.340
Two weeks later the
Eisenhower called

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.640
to say they had found
two letters from me

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.590
to President Eisenhower and when
I visited the LBJ Library they

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:55.490
gave me a copy of the
letter that I sent

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:58.550
to LBJ congratulating him for
signing the Civil Rights Act.

00:17:58.550 --> 00:17:59.850
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: David,

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:01.580
you've been working
on this for a while.

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:04.510
[ Laughter ]

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:07.300
[ Clapping ]

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.510
That is cool.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:12.540
[ Clapping ]

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.290
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: So
I'm sure you've heard

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:15.680
about our sleepovers and one

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.790
of the activities during our
sleepovers is an opportunity

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:21.180
for the kids to write a
letter to the President.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.040
And we deliver those
letters to the President

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.340
on the next Monday morning.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.620
And the White House then
supplies us with a letter

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:32.350
that we can send back to
them thanking the kids

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:37.680
for their interests and some
words of encouragement signed

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.820
by the President which
is a pretty nice touch.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.510
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
And I must tell you,

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:45.080
there have been wonderful
moments and things

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.090
that have been challenging
but one

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:50.210
of the most challenging
has been trying to figure

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:53.370
out as a former children's
library, right?

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:57.880
How I can top this
wonderful thing that you do

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.040
with children in the Archives?

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:05.510
They sleepover by the
Constitution, right?

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:09.050
[ Laughter ]

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:11.670
In that wonderful
place, there they are.

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:13.470
It's night and they're spooky

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.130
and they're all really
having fun.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:17.990
And then the next
morning and I've heard

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:21.110
so many people tell me
this, you know the Archivist

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:23.590
of the United States
makes pancakes

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:26.810
for the kids the next day.

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:29.200
[Laughter] So now
I don't worry --

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:33.480
we have Thomas Jefferson's
recipe for macaroni

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.780
and cheese [inaudible].

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.600
I'm trying to get
David and David --

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.980
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: She has been
trying to horn into this event

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.030
since she arrived [inaudible].

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.860
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: [Laughter]
And this is really true

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:46.910
because I have -- I said okay,

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:48.240
maybe we can make a
progressive weekend.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.740
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: A
progressive sleepover.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.630
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: See he knows.

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:55.310
[Laughter] I've got him -- at
least you're saying it, David.

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:56.610
[Laughter] Right?

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:57.910
Don't you think that'd be neat?

00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:59.690
So we have a new gang of
three, you know, in Washington.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.430
They have gangs of four and
five and eight, everything.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.730
So there's a new gang in
town, it's the gang of three.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:09.350
It's David Skorton, David
Ferriero, and Carla Hayden.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:13.110
And we, the Smithsonian, the
Archives, and the Library,

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:16.310
and we've actually met
and we talk about this.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:19.430
And we might have what
if the kids started

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.620
out at the Natural
History Museum, right?

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:25.230
With all that stuff and
then [laughter] I think

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:28.630
that would be -- or they slept
there because I think, you know,

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:31.030
that's -- and so we're
trying to figure this out.

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:33.060
And I think evenings
should be with us

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.460
with the macaroni and cheese.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.270
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: I think
Air and Space, I think Air

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:38.270
and Space already
does a sleepover.

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:39.570
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: See.

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:40.870
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: See.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.170
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: See we're
working together now.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:43.470
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: But you
did the mention the fact

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:45.380
that David Skorton, that's
an important thing --

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:46.680
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yes.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.980
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: -- thing
that we should talk about.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.280
And that is the close working
relationship that the three

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.640
of us had which is unlike --

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.940
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Any --

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.240
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: You
know, I've been there

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.170
for eight years almost nine
years and this is the first time

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.620
that the three institutions
have really gotten serious

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:00.920
about working together.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.240
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And
it's fun because when --

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:07.320
and so I invited the two
Davids over to the Library

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.530
of Congress for the luncheon.

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:12.460
And of course, our
curators and librarians put

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.330
out the good silver, we call it.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:17.090
You know, all of
our stuff, right?

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:18.430
And they're in there.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:23.500
And we knew that this
David was opera buff.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.650
So we had one of our
music librarians bring

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:30.300
out this wonderful -- these
just opera things that --

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.050
tell them some of the
stuff because you know.

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:33.460
I don't --

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.380
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: It
was the first printing

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:39.260
of the first liberto
for an opera.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.560
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Right.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.170
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
Which I had never --

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:43.470
I've never even heard of
which was [inaudible].

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:44.940
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: He
had never heard of it.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:48.410
And then David Skorton
is a jazz fanatic.

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:51.120
So we brought out the
Billie Strayhorn things

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.630
that we had just gotten and
all the Jelly Roll Morton.

00:21:54.630 --> 00:22:01.660
And then the curator was so
good, he knew opera and jazz.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:02.960
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
And could sing it.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.260
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: So he was --

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.560
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
And he sang --

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.860
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And he sang.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.510
[Inaudible] Plus we had
the chicken salad thing

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:09.810
and all that.

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:11.110
It was very nice.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:12.410
It was very nice.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:16.870
And so this curator had a
piece by Jelly Roll Morton

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:25.460
who is known for jazz that
bridge the two types of music

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.190
because Jelly Roll Morton
did an operetta or --

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:29.490
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: That's right.

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:30.790
That's right.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:32.090
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: --

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:33.390
did something and so he
just slid right into that.

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:36.440
Now David Skorton and I
think we can reveal this,

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:39.120
wanted to get the
card of the curator.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.420
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Oh yes.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.720
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: So there is
some poaching [inaudible].

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.020
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: He was
trying to steal the curator.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:44.320
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Right there.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.620
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
Right in front of her.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:46.920
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: [Laughter]
Right in front of me.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.220
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: How
long have you been here?

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.520
Are you happy here?

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.820
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Are you happy?

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.430
[ Laughter ]

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:53.730
Yes he's happy.

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:55.190
And I had to talk to the guy --

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:56.970
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Yeah,
you told him he was happy.

00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:58.270
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yeah.

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:00.100
I had to talk to
the guy afterwards.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:03.270
So are you happy?

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:07.290
So that kind of -- but
it's really a lot of fun

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:08.590
when you start joining forces.

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:09.890
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
Yeah but the pressure.

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:11.190
See we're doing the next one.

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:12.490
We're doing the next lunch.

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:13.790
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I'm afraid.

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:15.090
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: And
the pressure is already

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:16.670
on about what are we
going to show you.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:18.960
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And
that's the really cool stuff

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.540
because women suffrage is
coming up and you have a lot

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:23.930
of things and Smithsonian.

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:25.400
We're doing an exhibit.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:29.340
We even talked about it as you
mentioned Air and Space Museum.

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:33.320
You have for the Wright Brothers
some pretty cool things.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.620
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: The
Wright Brothers patent.

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:35.920
Yes.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.220
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: The patent.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.740
And the Library of Congress
has the actual papers.

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.040
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: That's right.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.340
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: David
McCullough did his book

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:44.730
on the Wright Brothers
was really based on that.

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:46.700
And then the Smithsonian
has the plane.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.000
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: The model.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.300
Yeah.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.600
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yeah.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.900
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Yeah.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.200
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And
so we're really working

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.530
to see what are some of the
things that we have that each

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:57.950
of us can bring together
for special exhibits

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:03.120
to really put things when one is
having an exhibit on something,

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.120
put something about it
in our own institution.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.420
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: That's right.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:08.860
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And
the Smithsonian we were

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:10.160
very pleased.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.930
We went halvies [phonetic]
to purchase the first photo,

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:16.920
known photo, of Harriet Tubman.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.830
And it's going to be exhibited
in the new -- we digitized it,

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:23.660
took care of it, and it's
going to be on exhibit

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:26.690
at the new Museum of
African American History

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:27.990
in College Town.

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:29.290
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: That's great.

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:32.270
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
So that type of --

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.570
[clapping] And you'll
see more of it.

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:35.310
Now we'll still have
the friendly rivalry.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:36.630
It's always fun.

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:40.330
And when Tony comes to play
and puts his thing down there

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:45.520
and all of that but just getting
this community of history

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.780
and culture seems to be growing.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.810
And we work together for that.

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:56.070
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: So what
has surprised you about --

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:58.970
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: At the
Library of Congress?

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:01.260
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: About
working in Washington?

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.060
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh.

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:07.080
[ Laughter ]

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:12.030
And Tony's over here
going don't say anything.

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:14.880
Tony's like [inaudible].

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.950
I still live in Baltimore and --

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:19.250
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
That says it all.

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:20.550
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: -- I commute.

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:21.850
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
That says it all.

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:23.150
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: No,
no, no, I commute

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:27.230
and it's really interesting
because I've lived in other --

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:32.310
when I lived in Chicago, there's
so many commuters that came in.

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:35.890
People would come into Chicago
from Gary, Indiana, every day.

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:41.970
And so this idea that people
come in from different states,

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:45.950
different places every day
and I'm taking the train now.

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:50.730
And you just see how many
people come in to the city

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:54.800
and then it goes --
it's like elastic.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.350
And I didn't get a
sense of that before.

00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:59.410
You know, you go in and you
think no, there are people

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:00.710
who live there and it grows.

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:02.010
And it really expands.

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:06.490
And how many -- and there's
an energy there that's similar

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:08.680
to New York where
you go into New York

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:13.280
and you just feel a
pace and it changes.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.760
And that's why when I go back to
Baltimore it's like, you know,

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:21.800
we have the Baltimore
[inaudible] and it's different.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.100
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: It's --

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.400
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: It's --

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.700
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: And there
are a lot of young people

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.000
in [inaudible] which
is really --

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.300
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And
they all walk fast

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:31.800
and they have [laughter]
two or three devices.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.210
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Yeah.

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:34.510
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
And they're just --

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.810
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
But they're all smart.

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:39.890
And they're all passionate
about what they're doing and --

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:41.190
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yeah.

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:42.640
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: It's
really rewarding --

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.940
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: The brain --

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:45.240
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
-- to work with them.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.540
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: -- power --

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:47.840
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Yeah.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.140
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: --
there is something.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.440
And so the Library
of Congress --

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.740
oh, you probably already do it.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.040
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Probably.

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.340
What is it?

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:55.640
Another idea you've
stolen from us?

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.940
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yes.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.270
[Laughter] Because we're going
to talk briefly about one

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:02.290
and in the public
citizen archivist

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:05.320
and the citizen historian
because that is really cool.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.980
So we're working on -- here
you have in Washington, D.C.,

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:11.910
literally some of the brightest,

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:15.090
smartest young people
you will ever ever meet.

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:20.050
And they are just -- some look
like they're 12 years old.

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:21.870
[Laughter] And they
are policy --

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:23.820
I mean they're just something.

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.330
And so we have tried to think

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.840
of how can we get
these young millennials

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:32.210
or they're not even
millennials, some of them.

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:33.510
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Right.

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:34.810
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: They're --

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:36.110
engaged because they
are so smart.

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:37.610
So they want to do -- so
we've had scavenger hunts

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:42.030
and a little Jeopardy and
some really cool things

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:43.330
to engage them.

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:45.270
We have libation
sometimes and things

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:48.740
like that but they -- yes.

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.510
Thomas Jefferson was
a wine connoisseur.

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:54.040
[ Laughter ]

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.510
You know, we work it.

00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:00.130
To get these young
people engaged in things

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:05.110
because they want
to still learn.

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:08.210
A lot of them are coming from
these colleges and they're right

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:11.240
out of college and they're --
you know still in Georgetown

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.660
and they're doing
all this stuff.

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:16.820
So they will sit and listen to
someone talk about something

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.140
or author or something.

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.440
They will.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.430
And they want to meet people.

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:24.490
One young congressional
staffer said, you know, we're --

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:27.760
you know our salaries
might, you know, we're here.

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:31.300
And so this is like date night.

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:34.210
They -- to go and
do something kind

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:37.080
of just [inaudible]
in the summer.

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.520
Free popcorn.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.700
How about that?

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.000
[Laughter] Big screen --

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.300
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
Ooh, free popcorn.

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:44.600
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: -- on the lawn.

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:45.900
With the machine.

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.200
It's not just --

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.500
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Oh my
God with a machine too.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.800
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
With the machine.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.890
[Laughter] With the machine free
popcorn and so then they get

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:55.300
to see -- oh I think we might
have you a little bit on that.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.620
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
No I don't think so.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:57.920
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Wait a minute.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:59.220
Okay. Wait a minute.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:02.150
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Let me
talk about the Young Founders.

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:03.450
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
Not fundraising.

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:05.010
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: This
is an idea that I took

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:08.420
from New York Public
Library, the Young Lions.

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:14.080
A similar kind of group really
interested in the library.

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.530
Been in existence for what?

00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:18.510
Twenty-five years or so.

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:25.160
Some fun day an award, fiction
award for a young author.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.420
And so I took that
idea to the New York --

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:31.660
to the National Archives and
we have a group, similar group

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:36.400
that we're working with, the
Young Founders Society trying

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:40.460
to engage them in the life
of the National Archives.

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:42.870
This is a group of folks
who are drawn in all kinds

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:44.170
of different directions.

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:47.790
So getting them to focus has
been the challenge but --

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:49.520
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: We
don't have a name yet.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.820
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Oh well.

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:53.100
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: So
we're working on that.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.420
I like Young Founders
because then you feel --

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:56.720
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Well
it's already been taken.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.020
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I know.

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:00.240
I'm saying this is -- but
that's the good thing.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.540
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Yeah.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.840
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
So we are working

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.240
on how we can get this
group and it's going

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.470
to be really though --
actually it's the same group

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:08.800
of kids -- or young people.

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.100
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Probably.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.400
Probably.

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.700
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
That will be going

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.000
to these types of
things and that --

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.300
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Well, if you
have any literature you want me

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.640
to share with my group I'll --

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.940
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Well let's talk

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.140
about your citizen
archivist because that one --

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:22.440
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Sure.

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.200
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: -- we
just took almost verbatim

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.140
and made it citizen historian

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:28.640
because of the transcription
and things.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:35.020
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: So when I was
hired in 2009 by President Obama

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:39.030
and on his first day in
office, he told his senior staff

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:41.420
that the government doesn't
have all the answers and we need

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.240
to figure out ways to
engage the American public

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:48.190
in solving some of
those problems.

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:51.800
And I took that to heart and
worked with the staff to think

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.540
about ways that we could
engage the American public

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.330
in the work that we do.

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:58.160
And the result of
that was the creation

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.060
of the citizen archivist
dashboard which has a number

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:06.420
of activities that you
can help us do our work.

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:08.950
Tagging photographs.

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:15.250
Identifying this is
become fairly standard now,

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:18.330
identifying people in
places in photographs.

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:21.400
But I think the centerpiece,
the thing I'm most excited

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:26.450
about is the transcription
project that we have going

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:30.550
on where we've loaded
thousands of records.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:34.050
Kids aren't being
taught [inaudible].

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:35.350
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Cursive.

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:36.650
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
[Inaudible] or -- in schools.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:38.770
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
Definitely not [inaudible].

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:43.880
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
[Laughter] And I have billions

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.440
of records in cursive.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.070
So we're, you know,

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:49.950
disenfranchising an
entire generation

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:53.420
and future generations because
they can read this stuff.

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:55.800
So we have people all over
the country and actually all

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.560
over the world who are
helping us transcribe

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:02.940
in this citizen archivist
dashboard activity.

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:06.750
So that's a way that we're
trying to engage the public

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:08.410
in helping do our work.

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:12.470
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And we just put
citizen historian and took it

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:15.080
because the model is so great.

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:19.580
And there is the same need
at the Library of Congress.

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:20.880
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: That's right.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.180
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Susan
B. Anthony's papers.

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.480
All these people.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.780
Frederick Douglas.

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:27.050
Some of the things
that are in cursive

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:31.920
that literally young people
and because of the writing,

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.240
sometimes other people
can't read these documents.

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:38.400
So the Library of Congress is
launching citizen historian

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.740
and we even reference
and say it started

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:44.390
with the National
Archives, citizen archivist

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:46.800
because we want people
that are doing one to think

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.740
about doing the other too.

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:50.170
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Well and
we're also working together

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:52.630
on are history hub
site where we're --

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:56.190
our reference folks are
sharing, collaborating --

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:57.490
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Right.

00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:58.790
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: -- and
providing reference service

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:01.460
to anyone who has a
particular reference question.

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:06.330
We're fielding and
sharing information

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:10.600
from our own collections
to solve the research needs

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.580
of the people who are
using history hub.

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.840
So that's another -- and
we're bringing the Smithsonian

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.750
on board with that also.

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:20.050
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Right.

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:21.350
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: And I
noticed that your folks were

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:23.720
at the National Archives
last week

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.590
for an editathon [phonetic],
a Wikipedia editathon.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:27.890
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yes.

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:29.190
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: So we're
working together on Wikipedia.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:30.490
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yeah,
working together.

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:36.220
And I also want to share
what I know we've talked

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:37.860
about a little bit.

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:41.280
The concern about
history going forward

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:46.950
and records being created
digitally and how we deal

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:50.830
with storage issues,
security, technology,

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:54.610
keeping up in the future, and
there's real concern at time.

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:59.920
That future historians
how will get these items

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:03.440
as history's being made
in a different format.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.080
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
It's the one thing --

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.500
of all the things that keep me
up at night, this is the one --

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:08.800
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: That's the one.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.100
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: --
that keeps me up at night.

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:13.420
Yeah. It's ensuring that, you
know, our mandate is to ensure

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:17.450
that people have access to
the records in perpetuity

00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:21.790
and you know, we're barely
able to guarantee that in paper

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:23.420
but being able to guarantee

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:27.360
that in the electronic
environment is our

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.720
biggest challenge.

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.020
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Is --

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:31.320
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: And I
always have in the back

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.840
of my head the work
that Nicholson Baker did

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.440
in a book entitled Double Fold.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.740
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yes.

00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:40.270
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
Where he chastised us

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:45.070
for microfilming all of those
early American newspapers

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:47.240
and throwing out the originals.

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.690
And leaving us in a
situation where here

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:52.680
in the United States
we did not have copies

00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:55.040
of our own newspapers.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.340
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: That's right.

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:57.640
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Because
the microfilm was --

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:02.650
and the microfilm is so poorly
created and disintegrated

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:05.250
in some cases but
there was no --

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:08.190
in lots of reels
no quality control.

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:12.660
So the images weren't perfect
and the worst thing was

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:19.690
that many of the -- The New York
Herald was the first, I believe,

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:21.850
newspaper to introduce color

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:26.480
into the comics on
Sunday editions.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:29.310
And the newspaper
microfilm is black and white.

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:37.200
So we lost the whole sense of
our history in a flawed project.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.500
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And that --

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:42.390
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: But I am
happy to report Nicholson Baker,

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:47.530
the month that the
book came out,

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:50.610
Nicholson Baker's book came
out, the librarian community,

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:52.000
of course, have circled
the wagons

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.980
and Nicholson is our enemy.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:58.250
[Laughter] And I was opening
a new storage facility

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:00.870
at Duke University and
I needed a speaker.

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:04.760
And I invited Nick to come
and be our speaker to open

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.760
because here is this
warehouse of paper.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.770
Isn't this wonderful, Nick?

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:13.480
And we had dinner --
Nick had raised the money

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:16.460
from his borrowing
from in-laws to buy

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:20.370
from the British Library the
only paper copies that existed.

00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:22.280
The British Library
was [inaudible] them.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:26.930
And Nick bought them and setup
a warehouse in New Hampshire.

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:30.410
He became a newspaper librarian
and was providing photographs

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:33.190
and things, scanned images
from this collection.

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:35.840
So and I invited Nick
to be our speaker.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.640
He came. We had dinner.

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:41.930
And I told him when you get
tired of newspaper librarian,

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:43.450
this wonderful new facility

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:46.590
that you just dedicated would
be a great place to house them.

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:49.580
And so those newspapers
are at Duke University now.

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:50.880
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Right.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.180
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Thank God.

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:54.710
So I always have that in
my mind when I'm thinking

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:56.010
about what we're dealing

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:59.730
with with this electronic
information.

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:02.370
So that we don't get
into the position

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:05.100
where we've lost everything

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.810
because of the security
things --

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:09.110
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Sure.

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:12.010
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
Technology, all kinds of issues.

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:14.910
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And
the security thing

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:19.990
that becomes even more of an
issue with the technology.

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:25.520
The Library of Congress, for
instance, has storage modules

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.220
and they are modules
but think Amazon

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:31.290
and what those warehouses look

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:35.170
like in Fort Meade,
military base.

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:36.470
[Inaudible] that.

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:42.660
The electronic environment
in terms of security

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:47.360
and making those transitions
as technology progresses.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:53.920
So there's that fiscal part
that's a major challenge too.

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.990
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Exactly
and we're doing a lot of work

00:37:55.990 --> 00:38:00.360
with the industry to educate
them about what the needs are

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:05.680
around tools that -- for, in
my case, the agencies need

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:10.620
to create and maintain
their records.

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:13.710
The situation in the federal
government is very much the

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:17.220
situation that I remember
from the university settings

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:22.270
where every agency -- I mean
every faculty was able to go off

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:24.620
and build their own system or
buy something off the shelf.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:26.810
And there was no
interoperability.

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:30.930
There was no enterprise
approach to technology

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:33.520
and that is clearly
the description

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.750
of the federal government
that --

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:37.090
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: So
each department --

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:38.390
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Yeah.

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:39.690
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: --
has its own way --

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:40.990
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Right.

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:42.290
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: -- of
sealing [inaudible].

00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:43.590
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: So the state

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:46.340
of information technology
infrastructure is not

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:49.480
where it should be and that's
another issue that's outlined

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.930
in the reform plan.

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:56.320
Another point that is
in support of the work

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.960
that we're trying to do.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.260
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: What about
the resources to keep up?

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:01.820
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
Well that's -- yeah.

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:03.120
How's your budget?

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:04.650
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Ah.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:09.420
[Laughter] Well the technology,
it actually been very supported

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.710
in terms of the technology
effort and bringing the Library

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:16.340
of Congress to be a
modern and very efficient.

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:21.280
And that's been very heartening
coming in and seeing that

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.520
and having that kind of support.

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:25.810
And you know, that you
have to maintain it

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:30.490
and also the staffing
that you need to have

00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:33.530
that digital strategy
that's going to be able

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:35.250
to look forward and keep going.

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:40.970
So we just hired a digital
strategy manager and are going

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:43.970
to do more with that
because we have to.

00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:48.260
We have to look at and also
look back at the same time.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:49.560
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Exactly.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:53.410
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: So it's a fun
time in a lot of ways because --

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:54.710
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: You should --
we should actually put that --

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:57.580
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: -- we're
getting a lot of people

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:01.520
from the technology sector that
are coming into the library

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:04.880
to work and to help us to try
to solve some of these things.

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.670
And that's brought a --

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:09.710
some energy and some
cross fertilization.

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:11.770
That's been real
exciting for us.

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:13.110
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: That's
something we should put

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:16.350
on our agenda for the
three of us when we --

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:17.650
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: The technology.

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:20.170
And we even had and I
referred back to Tony.

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:23.340
One of his -- he hired someone

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:25.930
from Great Britain
to come over --

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:27.230
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: BBC.

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:28.530
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: The BBC.

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:32.480
That is a technology digital
guru and we had him come

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:35.050
to the Library of Congress
and talk to our staff

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:38.950
about what New York
Public is doing.

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:42.730
They're -- we're a little
jealous of some of the stuff

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:45.090
but they're doing a
lot of cool things.

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:46.390
And we had him come.

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:50.120
So just this cross fertilization
between institutions,

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:55.700
between types of libraries,
archives, has been, I think,

00:40:55.700 --> 00:41:00.420
helpful for us to share and
say hey we have common problems

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:02.570
and what could we do together.

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:05.750
Now the -- we have the
young professionals.

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:07.580
We have the children.

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:10.690
Are you working on
things for seniors?

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:12.590
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
Things for seniors.

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:14.390
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh good.

00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:21.280
[ Laughter ]

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.300
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Yeah we're
planning a sleepover for --

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:24.600
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: No --

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.400
[ Laughter ]

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:30.050
[ Clapping ]

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:32.830
Well we have a wonderful
partnership

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:34.850
with AARP, I must say.

00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:38.850
They've supported the Book
Festival and some other things.

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:40.150
And --

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:41.450
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: We have a
lot of support from them also.

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:43.000
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I know you do

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.700
but what can we do
to engage seniors?

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:53.180
And as I'm mature, that becomes
a particular interest as well.

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.480
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: We do have --

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:58.800
it's been interesting to watch
this transcription project

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.700
because there are a number

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:05.140
of senior centers
and nursing homes.

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:08.630
There's a nursing home in Lynn,
Massachusetts who has adopted us

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:10.370
and is doing transcriptions.

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:11.670
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yes.

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:12.970
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Which
I think is wonderful.

00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:15.610
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And see that's
in terms of retired professors

00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:17.610
and people that want
to keep engaged.

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:18.910
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Yeah.

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:20.800
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And because
you can do it remotely

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:25.330
that with limited mobility
with a lot of seniors.

00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:28.680
This is a way that they can
keep involved and keep that

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:32.580
but we're going to have -- I
won't even -- well I can --

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:33.910
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
What are you doing?

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:35.470
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
About cooking to --

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:37.030
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero:
Macaroni and cheese.

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:38.730
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Stay tuned.

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:40.030
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Probably.

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:41.330
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Stay tuned.

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:42.650
The Library of Congress has one

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:44.300
of the world's largest
collections

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.760
of historical cookbooks.

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.710
So imagine what programming
you could do with that.

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:51.510
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Amazing.

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:52.810
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Not
going to say anything

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:55.930
because he'll steal it because
he probably has the patent

00:42:55.930 --> 00:43:02.280
to whatever the mixer [laughter]
or something like that.

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.580
You do. You do.

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:06.330
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Well before
your time we had a blockbuster

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:08.040
exhibit called What's
Cooking Uncle Sam

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.400
about the government's role in
food which told the story --

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:16.730
a horrible story about testing
preservatives and the changes

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:20.350
of the food groups over time.

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:22.730
Did you know butter
used to be a food group?

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:24.030
Butter.

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:25.330
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I
still think it is.

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:27.190
[ Laughter ]

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:29.770
Yeah I'm for that.

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:35.200
Yeah. Well the -- and I have
to talk about your shop.

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:39.620
You just renovated and you
have a new education center

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:44.280
and your shop is to die for.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.580
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Yeah, I know.

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:49.110
I heard you were trying
to steal my shop manager.

00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:50.410
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I was scouting.

00:43:50.410 --> 00:43:52.910
You know? We're renovating
our shop.

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:54.290
We're renovating our shop.

00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:59.670
I had to do a field trip and
I did talk to the nice lady.

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:02.510
She seems moderately happy.

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:07.640
[ Laughter ]

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.880
I mean she did your shop.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.480
She's ready for a new challenge.

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:12.780
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: We stole her.

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:14.570
You know we stole
her from the zoo.

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:17.060
[ Laughter ]

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:19.950
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I'm not
saying a word with that one.

00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:21.370
I'm letting that go.

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:23.880
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: In her first
year, she introduced socks

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:27.470
into the repertoire
and $100,000 worth

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:28.820
of socks in the first year.

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.120
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: That's right.

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.420
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: Your shop --

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:35.150
the really cool thing about
the Archives and the shop is

00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:38.240
that when you're in a
section and they have sections

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:43.190
that are just wonderful
about subjects and eras,

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:46.770
the World War II,
and all of this.

00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:51.150
There are the terminals
right there that connect you

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:54.060
to the collections and
what else you can do.

00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:58.680
So right when you're making
that decision about purchasing,

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:02.580
you also are being tied
to the Archives and that.

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:09.670
And that's what really makes it
not just a retail experience.

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:13.810
Those are great but the
tie in to the content

00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:16.300
of the Archives is
what really got it.

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:17.690
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: So
then if you've never been

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:19.910
to the National Archives,
there are two entrances.

00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:22.360
One on Pennsylvania Avenue and
one on Constitution Avenue.

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:24.430
The Constitution side is
if you want to come in

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:26.020
and see the charters
and the exhibits

00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:28.610
and the museum side
of the house.

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:30.880
And the other side
is for research.

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:35.170
You come in that door to use
the collection to do research.

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:37.430
And I've been -- since I
got there trying to figure

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:39.630
out ways to break that wall.

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:45.290
Break a hole through that wall
so that there's more interaction

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:49.860
on both sides so that you get
a taste on the museum side

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:51.160
about what's possible.

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:54.730
Genealogists -- genealogy
is our biggest market.

00:45:54.730 --> 00:46:00.900
Most -- [cheering] --
genealogists than anything else.

00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:05.780
Genealogists then Veterans and
then everything else after that

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:10.860
but some way to use
the experience --

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:13.130
immediate experience
from the museum

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:15.170
on the other side
in the research.

00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:18.530
On the research side to
get people more interested

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:20.360
and excited about
not just genealogy

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.550
but our records in general.

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:25.990
Learning more about
our history and more --

00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:29.060
most important, learning
about civics

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:30.360
and how the government works.

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:31.660
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Yes.

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:32.960
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: And what the
three branches of government are

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:36.810
and what their responsibilities
are as American citizens.

00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:38.130
That's what --

00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:39.430
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Right.

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:41.010
&gt;&gt; David Ferriero: --
I'm trying to figure out.

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:43.430
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
[Clapping] Well we all are.

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:47.110
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
