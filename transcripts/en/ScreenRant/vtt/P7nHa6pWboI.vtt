No matter how much time is spent writing the
perfect script, or assembling the perfect

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.450
cast, a single celebrity appearance can wind
up being the only thing audiences talk about.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.949
Whether it's adding to the story, delivering
an unexpected gag, or just an incredible moment

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.150
that fans might not even catch, the right
cameo can take a movie from good to great.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.560
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Amazing Movie Cameos
You've Never Seen.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.840
Jurassic World (Universal)

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:37.260
Corporate branding was a major plot point
in the Jurassic Park reboot, which meant the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.399
bigger, better dinosaur park featured an IMAX
theatre, and even Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville,

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.340
the chain of restaurants founded by the famous
singer. When the customers are sent scrambling

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.420
by attacking pteradons, it's hard to miss
one man who doesn't want to lose his margaritas

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.199
in the chaos. The best part: that's Jimmy
Buffett himself, apparently more worried about

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.640
keeping his costs down than a pack of killer
dinosaurs.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.309
Star Trek Nemesis (Paramount)

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.199
Some directors like to keep their favorite
TV shows and movie franchises to themselves,

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.850
but director Bryan Singer was an obvious Star
Trek fan long before he helmed the big screen

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.330
reboot. He even included a nod to the original
series in his X-Men universe, but it was Next

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.790
Generation star Patrick Stewart who scored
him a cameo in Star Trek: Nemesis officially

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.240
making him an in-universe crew member of the
USS Enterprise.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.759
Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel/Disney)

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.810
From the moment James Gunn got the job of
writing and directing Marvel's space adventure,

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.320
fans knew that actor Nathan Fillion would
have to make an appearance, having starred

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.100
in Gunn's previous movies Slither and Super.
Rumors spun out of control claiming the Firefly

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.460
star would play one of a dozen cosmic heroes,
but in the end, most casual fans probably

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.430
missed his cameo altogether. The actor's sense
of humor wasn't used to play an outlaw, Ravager,

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.020
or goon - just a prison inmate promising to
put Star-Lord through a night he'd never forget.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:56.909
It's a 
smaller role than fans hoped for, but you

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.780
can't say it's not a memorable one.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.960
Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom (Paramount)

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.090
Raiders of the Lost Ark was a universal hit,
but fans are a bit more divided on its prequel,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.010
Temple of Doom. So some Indiana Jones fans
may not have realized that Ghostbusters star

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.690
Dan Akroyd makes a blink-and-you-miss-it appearance
sending Indy onto an airplane out of Shanghai.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.230
The actor made the cameo since he was a close
friend to director Steven Spielberg - who

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.580
can also be spotted, along with producers
George Lucas, Frank Marshall and Kathleen

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.330
Kennedy dressed as missionaries in the same
scene!

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.660
Ghostbusters (Columbia Pictures)

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.840
Ron Jeremy may be better known for his career
in&nbsp;adult&nbsp;films, but he's made at least one

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.560
Hollywood appearance worth watching. When
the containment unit at Ghostbusters headquarters

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.030
is turned off in the first movie, it releases
every ghost, spectre or spirit the team has

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:49.060
caught. It sends the movie to its climax,
and Ron Jeremy is there to see it firsthand,

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.819
in an uncredited cameo among the New Yorkers
gathering to see the explosion.

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.510
Hot Fuzz (Universal/Rogue)

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.550
Seeing a famous actor or director in the background
of a movie is a fun thing to watch out for,

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.940
but what about celebrities put right in the
spotlight without fans ever noticing? Director

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.110
Edgar Wright packed too many cameo to count
into his buddy-cop action comedy, but two

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.560
stand out for their&nbsp;eyes&nbsp;alone. The man
dressed as Santa Clause putting a knife through

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.230
the hero's hand in flashback is Lord of the
Rings mastermind Peter Jackson, and his masked

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.260
girlfriend--make that ex-girlfriend--is played
by none other than Oscar-winning actress Cate

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.120
Blanchett.&nbsp;

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.290
Spaceballs (MGM)

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:39.459
The Star Wars parody from Mel Brooks is filled
with inside jokes and slapstick humor, but

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.480
it wasn't just George Lucas's trilogy that
got sent up in the movie. When the hero Lone

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.879
Starr and his partner Barf stop in at a space
truckstop, they get a front row seat for a

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:52.120
horror show. Reenacting the chestburster scene
from Alien would have been a good enough joke,

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.739
but actually having Oscar nominated actor
John Hurt reprise his role as the alien's

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:02.650
victim is too good a cameo to believe.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.220
Dumb &amp; Dumber To (Universal)

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.900
The original Farrelly Brothers movie starring
Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels was a hit from

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:16.709
the start, but the sequel released twenty
years later... wasn't. Oscar winner Jennifer

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.459
Lawrence may have had her brief scene cut
from the movie completely, but one incredible

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.320
cameo made it through. Most viewers will recognize
that Harry's new roommate, Icepick, is a crystal

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.560
meth cooker torn right out of AMC's Breaking
Bad - what they won't recognize is that it's

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:38.290
one of the directors' friends under the mask:
Bill Murray.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.830
Mallrats (Gramercy Pictures)

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.320
Today, every fan of X-Men, Spider-Man, or
Marvel's Avengers universe knows Stan Lee,

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.620
the creator of some of the most famous superheroes
in comic book history. That's thanks to his

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.979
almost mandatory cameos that fans know to
watch out for. But long before his characters

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.130
were dominating the box office, it was director
Kevin Smith who knew a brief appearance from

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.889
the Marvel icon in his second movie would
send comic book nerds into a frenzy. Lee's

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.930
scene is probably the funniest, and most dramatic
one he's ever turned in, playing along with

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:12.560
the movie's crude humor, and even delivering
a heart-to-heart for the ages - even more

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.110
impressive since he made it all up.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.840
Hook (TriStar Pictures)

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.550
This re-imagining of Peter Pan was meant to
be a children's movie, but there were plenty

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:28.330
of kid who couldn't handle the infamous "Boo
Box" - Captain Hook's punishment for men in

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.449
his crew who doubted his plan. But the pirate
who wound up locked in the box with some scorpion

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:37.280
friends wasn't a man at all, but actress Glenn
Close in disguise. Apparently it pays to have

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.460
Steven Spielberg as a director, since he also
roped in George Lucas and Carrie fisher to

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.710
play the kissing couple accidentally sprinkled
with fairy dust.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.699
Those are the best celebrity cameos we noticed
in our favorite films, but which ones do you

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:52.280
think we missed? Be sure to name them in the
comments, and remember to subscribe to our
