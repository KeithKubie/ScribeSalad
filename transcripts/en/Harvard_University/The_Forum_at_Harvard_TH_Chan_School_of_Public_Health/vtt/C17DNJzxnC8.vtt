[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:56.048 --> 00:00:57.788
MICHELLE A. WILLIAMS:
Good morning.

00:00:57.788 --> 00:00:59.241
AUDIENCE: Good morning.

00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:00.990
MICHELLE A. WILLIAMS:
Welcome to The Forum

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.069
at the Harvard T.H. Chan
School of Public Health.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.940
I'm Michelle Williams, dean of
the faculty here at the school,

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.000
and I'm delighted to
see you all here today.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.470
I'm also delighted to
welcome our online viewers

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.980
around the world,
including those tuning in

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.230
from India, Hong Kong,
and other sites globally,

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.570
as well as those
in our community

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.230
who are spread across
the campuses in Boston

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.330
and in Cambridge.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.650
Today, we are gathered to
discuss an essential concept

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.350
that, at times,
may feel elusive,

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.980
and that concept is well-being.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.950
I'm deeply honored and
really humbled to welcome

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.970
our distinguished guest,
Dr. Deepak Chopra New York

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.600
Times bestselling author
and founder of the Chopra

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.190
Foundation.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.870
Dr. Chopra is a world-renowned
expert on well-being.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.330
He has recently
published a new book,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.960
The Healing Self, A
Revolutionary New Plan

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.010
to Supercharge Your Immunity
and Stay Well For Life.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.850
This is a book that's coauthored
with Harvard's own neurology

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.760
professor, Dr. Rudy Tanzi.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.910
This event this morning
is presented jointly

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.690
with PRI's The World and WGBH.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.650
And I am pleased to
welcome The World's Carol

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.590
Hills, our moderator for today's
conversation with Dr. Chopra.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.530
We are streaming live on the
websites of The World and The

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.470
Forum, as well as other
social media platforms.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.740
We will look at our
world today as we

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.090
tend to focus on the
problems that many of us

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.360
confront here at the
school and beyond.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.780
For example, think about
the problems we confront--

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.140
chronic and infectious
diseases undermining the health

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.880
of populations; natural
disasters strike, often

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.720
hitting hardest the most
vulnerable populations;

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.220
social injustices and
health disparities

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.210
sadden and frustrate us
all; and mental health,

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.120
a key part of overall
wellness, tends

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.580
to go under-appreciated or even
unappreciated in some contexts.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.890
Yet, psychosocial
stress, depression,

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.210
and anxiety impact
hundreds of millions

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.190
of people around the world.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.880
So what can public health
do about these challenges?

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.580
How can public health help?

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.580
Let me offer a few
examples to illustrate

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.890
how public health can help.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.750
We can recognize that healthy
lives across the life course

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.490
are not just those lived
without sickness and disability.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.930
We can help people engage in
wellness across their life

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.190
spans.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.910
What do we mean by that?

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.990
We can help people
by easing access

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.320
to affordable and
nutritious food.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.329
We can help by promoting
social connectedness.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:25.810
We can help by offering access
to good quality health care,

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.080
and we can help by
educating people

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.350
about the importance
of managing stress

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.340
and getting enough
sleep and exercise.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.850
We can also encourage
an holistic approach

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.290
that supports these
foundations with respect

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:50.110
to personal health, as well
as within healthy communities.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.050
And perhaps most
importantly, we can

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.620
help to bring evidence
that drives policy

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.160
to promote systems
and approaches that

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.080
bolster the well-being
of entire populations.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.060
We here at the
Harvard Chan School

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.870
consider well-being as
such an important part

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.030
of what constitutes a healthy
world that we have identified

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.200
well-being and nutrition as
key components of our research

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.240
mission.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.770
We will begin today with Dr.
Chopra giving brief remarks

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.500
here at the podium,
and then he will join

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.740
Carol Hills in a conversation.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.190
We have already received a
large number of questions

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.100
in advance of our
session, and Carol

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.170
will share some
of those with you,

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.160
along with questions contributed
by our local viewing audience

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.510
here.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.200
To start today's program
I get to do an Oprah.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.260
I'm sure she'd like to know
that her name is a verb as well.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.430
[GIGGLING]

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.120
I have an opportunity
to have a little fun.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.940
And what I'd like to
do is ask everyone here

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.700
in the auditorium to
look at the postcards

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.250
at the desk in front of them.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:11.500
And if your postcard has a
sticker on the reverse side,

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.440
then I'm happy to
share with you that you

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.600
will receive a complementary
copy of The Healing Self

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.280
after our program.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.610
So read it, enjoy it,
be well, have fun.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.100
It is now my great
pleasure and honor

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.751
to welcome Dr.
Chopra to the podium.

00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:35.697
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.010
DEEPAK CHOPRA: Well,
thank you, Dr. Williams--

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.970
Dean Williams.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.385
And thank you all
for being here.

00:06:51.385 --> 00:06:54.910
I'm very honored,
privileged, and always

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.850
happy to come back to Boston.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:02.920
My training was here in internal
medicine, endocrinology,

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.670
and then neuroendocrinology.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:09.920
So I was telling Dean Williams
that my career has spanned

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.640
internal medicine,
endocrinology,

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.690
discovery of neuropeptides
as molecules of emotion,

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:20.380
getting into mind-body
medicine, integrative health,

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.220
and well-being, and today,
addressing the hard problem

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.300
of consciousness.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.110
So I'd like to
start off by saying

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:36.220
that as biological organisms, we
are already a holistic process.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.350
All biological organisms
function holistically.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:44.620
The human body has more
than 60 trillion cells,

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.460
which is more than all the
stars in the Milky Way galaxy.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.820
A human body can think
thoughts, play a piano,

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:56.550
kill germs, remove toxins, make
a baby all at the same time,

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:01.510
while monitoring the
movement of planets and stars

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.870
as its own biological
rhythm-- circadian rhythms,

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:10.330
seasonal rhythms, gravitational
rhythms, even lunar rhythms.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.020
That homeostasis,
or self-regulation,

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.030
is our natural state.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:20.050
And the extreme end
of the spectrum--

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.330
if homeostasis of
self-regulation, which

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:27.540
is a dynamic process of
non-change within change

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:32.169
is one extreme, then
low-grade chronic inflammation

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:38.650
is the other extreme,
which leads to disease.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:44.020
Only 5%-- only 5% of
disease-related gene mutations

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:48.740
are fully penetrant, which
means they cannot be stopped.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:49.840
5%.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.180
If somebody has a BRCA gene,
for example, for breast cancer,

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.690
that's a fully-penetrant gene.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:09:00.920
And one needs to do remedial
measures as prevention.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:06.460
Angelina Jolie has gone public
with her preventive mastectomy

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.110
and so forth, because
she had that gene.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:11.380
Now, what most
people don't know,

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.350
other than those who
are really involved,

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:20.260
is that's true of 95% of
chronic illness in our world.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.920
Even mutations that
lead to disease

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.280
are not fully penetrant.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.840
So if you have,
say, 30 identified

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.280
genes for Alzheimer's, only
three are fully penetrant.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:37.090
Hundreds of genes are involved
in various types of cancer.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.270
Less than 5% are
fully penetrant.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:43.780
And the fact that
the risk factors

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:48.220
for heart disease,
stroke, inflammation,

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:53.300
cancer autoimmune illness,
infectious diseases

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.860
are actually common, they're
the same risk factors

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.550
that we've been looking at
for cardiovascular disease

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.960
for the last 35 years.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:08.720
So with that understanding of
our body as a holistic process,

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.750
a body as a verb--

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:15.380
and I'd like to say that nouns
are conventions of language,

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.830
but they do not reflect reality.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:20.700
Reality is always an activity.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.630
A body is an activity.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:26.650
Even this is an activity at the
level of atoms and particles.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:31.250
But biological organisms are
so dynamic at maintaining

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:35.680
self-regulation that if we put
attention to just a few things,

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:40.270
so the neural sciences
of neuroplasticity--

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:44.080
neuroplasticity means that
your conscious choices

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.180
regulate your neural networks.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.710
And if you make
something a habit,

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:51.460
you create something called
long-term potentiation

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:55.070
of neural networks
that basically

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:59.070
help to regulate
your own biology,

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.910
and so neural feedback,
cardiac feedback.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:06.110
But just simple
things like meditation

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:12.290
will change the way you look
at self-regulation and healing.

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:14.750
The word "healing" comes
from the word "holy."

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:19.330
Healing, holy, wholeness,
health are the same word.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:24.020
It's reminding yourself of
your connection to wholeness.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:28.020
So with what we know of
neuroplasticity, epigenetics,

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.450
which means we--

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.849
every experience that you
have-- every experience,

00:11:31.849 --> 00:11:33.890
including the experience
you're having right now,

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:37.370
even if you're online and
watching it from India--

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:42.260
every experience is modulating
not only your neural networks

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.660
but your gene activity.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:48.070
And similarly, your
microbiome, which

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:51.890
is two million extra genes, is
responding to every experience

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:57.200
you have, whether it's sleep or
food or exercise or meditation

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.820
or yoga.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.310
So over the years,
I've identified

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:04.850
what I call the six
pillars of well-being.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:10.660
These are not necessarily
in order of importance.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:11.910
They're all equally important.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.240
So the first is sleep.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.270
We can go into details
at any time on that.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:21.410
Second is stress management--
mindfulness, meditation,

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:25.310
and many other
contemplative techniques

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:29.240
that have been part of wisdom
traditions all over the world.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.940
And we have now
original research

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.760
to show that even
a week of practice

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:39.380
of mindfulness and meditation
will up-regulate your gene

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:39.980
activity.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:43.100
Some genes will go up 17-fold--

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.800
genes for wound healing,
genes for homeostasis.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.660
And genes that are responsible
for inappropriate inflammation

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.400
will go down.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.580
We have shown that
telomerase, the enzyme that

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:59.090
regulates your genetic
clock, in some cases,

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:03.380
will go up by 40% in people
who practice contemplative

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.870
self-inquiry, mindfulness,
and meditation.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.950
There's no drug
that will do that.

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:09.230
So that's the second pillar.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.610
The third is movement.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:14.600
And if you add to that
practices, like yoga

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.060
and breathing prana
and practices,

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:21.440
you can specifically target
several different organs

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.080
in your body.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.840
Because yoga has the knowledge
of which visceral nerves are

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.390
activated with which
kind of movement-- yoga

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.840
postures, or asanas,
as they're called.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.460
So movement is the third pillar.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.350
The fourth pillar is emotions.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:42.350
So we know that stress,
and anger, and hostility,

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:47.150
and guilt, and shame,
and depression all

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:51.370
aggravate inflammation,
and raise blood pressure,

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:54.830
and cause sticky platelets,
and everything that goes wrong

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:58.290
when homeostasis is disrupted.

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:02.600
But we now also have evidence
that love, compassion, joy,

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:08.360
equanimity, a peaceful mind, and
even keeping a gratitude list

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.880
will decrease
inflammatory markers

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:15.290
and activate the genes that
are responsible for homeostasis

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.150
and self-regulation.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:23.360
So emotions become very
practical as a way to harness

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.330
emotional and
social intelligence

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:29.090
for optimal self-regulation.

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:33.770
And finally, two more things,
which one is nutrition--

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:35.300
Michelle mentioned.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.380
When I was training
in internal medicine,

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.890
people called me and said,
you know, I changed my diet,

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:44.884
and my arthritis went away,
or my asthma went away.

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:45.800
I didn't believe them.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.820
I had no basis to understand
how that happened.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:52.940
But now that we know that the
microbiome, two million genes

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:56.090
in your gut, the first
thing they see is food.

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:58.150
And if your food
is contaminated,

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:02.000
has too much fat, too much
sugar, too many chemicals,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.960
or pesticides, or petroleum
products, or processed food,

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.940
then you have dysbiosis,
inflamed microbiome that causes

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.300
inflammation in the body.

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:17.210
Your microbiome, your genes,
and your epigenetic mechanisms

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.130
are all influences--

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:22.820
the metabolic activity
in your body right now.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.050
So nutrition becomes
very important.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:28.790
And then, Carol was asking
me, I think, earlier,

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:32.840
do I experience jet lag
because I travel so much?

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.970
And I think this is a
very important point,

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:36.680
that our biological
rhythms are very

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.010
important in self-regulation.

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:43.700
And so that we now know that
if you eat within the eight

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:49.080
hours of daylight, if you
get good sleep at night,

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.520
and if you ground yourself,
even by touching a tree

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.090
or walking barefoot
on the earth,

00:15:55.090 --> 00:16:01.190
or on grass, or on the beach, or
even using a grounding device,

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:04.060
that will decrease
inflammation in your body,

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:09.340
avoid disruption of
circadian rhythms, which

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.750
is what jet lag is all about.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.350
So with these six
pillars that I mentioned,

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:19.300
you can hone in on your
biological sustainability.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.670
But if you want to go
beyond that to what,

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:25.460
essentially, is the mission of
the School of Public Health,

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.210
then you have to
address bigger problems.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:33.810
There is no social well-being
or community well-being

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:35.790
in the absence of
personal well-being,

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:39.490
because we are units of society.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:42.180
So if we want to move in the
direction of some of the things

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:47.880
that were mentioned
by Dr. Williams,

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.840
if you want to move in the
direction of a more peaceful,

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.000
just, sustainable,
healthier, and joyful world,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.840
then we have to look at what
creates for purpose-driven

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.650
well-being, or what we
call career well-being,

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:05.819
people who have happy
careers, who are on purpose,

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:08.819
who are engaged with other
people who complement

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:12.720
their strengths, who have shared
vision and are emotionally

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.579
bonded--

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:16.859
create for extremely
successful careers.

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:22.230
Then, you have social and
emotional and community

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:24.599
well-being, which
is, do you have

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:29.550
a close group of family and
friends that you can rely on?

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.160
Are you socially engaged?

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.680
As far as communities
are concerned,

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:39.450
do you offer some
service as a volunteer?

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:42.870
Do you gather in a
community to envision

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:44.920
the future of your community?

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.690
Do you have some kind of
practice, spiritual practice

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:50.430
that you do together?

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.520
In India-- and I know people
are watching in India--

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.840
we use these three words,
Seva, Satsang, and Simran.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.750
Seva means service.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.030
Satsang means a
gathering of people

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:07.710
who are looking for ways to
improve well-being and search

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.470
for what is called reality.

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:15.270
And Simran is some kind of
contemplative self-inquiry.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:19.530
Those are the essence
of community well-being.

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:22.110
Social well-being,
career well-being,

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:24.150
community well-being,
and, ultimately,

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.460
financial well-being are linked.

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.080
Financial well-being
doesn't have

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:32.310
to do with how much money you
make, but the security that you

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:39.390
have if you have default ways of
ensuring that you will be fine

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:42.810
if you fall sick, that you
have employment, that you have

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.440
disability, that
you have insurance,

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:50.850
and that you can look forward
to security as you get old.

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:52.650
And finally, the
spiritual well-being,

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:54.360
which is another topic--

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.070
who are we?

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.170
The hard problem
of consciousness--

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.450
is consciousness a
byproduct of our brain,

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.450
or is it more
fundamental in nature?

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:06.570
Is consciousness the
source of all experience?

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:12.000
And that's what I'm focusing
my work on now totally, looking

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.040
at the hard problem
of consciousness

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.310
and understanding
our consciousness

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:23.500
both personal and collective as
a source of insight, intuition,

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:29.040
imagination, creativity,
vision, higher purpose,

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.830
and the power of intention.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.110
So when we look at well-being--
and it's measurable.

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:37.770
Everything I've said is
measurable-- social well-being,

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:40.110
community well-being,
financial well-being,

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:42.870
physical well-being,
emotional well-being.

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:48.030
In fact, now, in addition to
doing perceived stress scores,

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:52.590
we're also doing spiritual
well-being stress scores called

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:58.660
understanding your relationship
with the ecosystem at large--

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:02.670
not just the social
ecosystem, but our connection

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:06.810
to nature and, ultimately, our
connection to the universe.

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.480
It's a big topic.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.330
Public health should be
the number one discipline

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:18.540
for anyone wanting to go into
the future of well-being,

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:21.060
because it's going
to be predictable.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.860
It's going to be precise.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:27.520
It's going to be
preventable, in many cases.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.560
It's going to be
participatory, and it's

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.170
going to be processed-oriented.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:38.370
And it's going to require more
than academic institutions.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:44.790
It's going to require a
global public awareness

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:50.910
and require a global
action plan, which

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:54.780
I think is feasible
through blockchain

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:59.010
technologies and
other social networks,

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:05.100
so that we can collectively not
only envision but practically

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:09.120
embark in the direction
of a more peaceful, just,

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.940
sustainable, healthier,
and joyful world.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.520
I was sharing with Michelle
some of our research

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.980
now at the Chopra Foundation
through meta-analysis

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.330
of big data.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:26.500
It seems the number one epidemic
of our civilization is stress,

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:30.210
but it's also connected
directly or indirectly

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:31.920
to almost every
illness that you can

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:35.730
think of and even to social
violence and conflict.

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:39.960
And ultimately,
even climate change

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.970
can all be linked to
our collective behavior.

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:47.280
It's time to take
schools of public health

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:51.480
with leadership such
as this here at Harvard

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:55.410
School of Public Health,
come together collectively,

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:59.280
and bring about a
shift in well-being.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.070
And I'll just end there.

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:02.820
Well-being is more
than wellness.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.880
Wellness is having a
good cholesterol level

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.860
and good blood pressure.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:12.660
But well-being is a
state of consciousness

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:16.530
where you measure the
quality of your life in all

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:19.270
the different buckets that
I've mentioned-- physical,

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:25.210
emotional, spiritual, community,
social, financial, and career.

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:25.710
Thank you.

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:29.182
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:48.752 --> 00:22:50.460
CAROL HILLS: Well,
It's great to be here.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.170
I welcome everyone.

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:53.310
I'm Carol Hills.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:56.580
And I wanted to
unpack a lot of what

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.580
Dr. Chopra is talking
about in his new book

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:00.645
and in his remarks.

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:08.400
I think most of us in this
room are familiar with wellness

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:13.530
and mindfulness, and there
is a whole genre of books

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:16.680
and films and documentaries.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.700
And in many ways, it's
focused on the individual

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:24.240
and what individuals can
do to take responsibility

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.710
for their own health.

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:28.370
And I wonder, how do we--

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:32.700
I want to frame this
conversation by thinking about,

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:36.970
how do we apply these things
in the world of public health

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:40.000
and where we're talking
about populations?

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.610
And we're talking very
often about populations

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:46.280
without access,
living in poverty,

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.340
people whose lives
are full of stress

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:52.000
and have very
little to work with.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.760
And so I wanted to start with--

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.210
you mentioned one thing
in your opening remarks

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:00.700
about blockchain technology.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.190
And I wonder if you
could elaborate on that

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:05.005
and where it concerns
public health.

00:24:05.005 --> 00:24:07.330
DEEPAK CHOPRA: Well,
blockchain technologies

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:11.770
are self-regulating
movements and technologies

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:13.700
for just about everything.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.450
So one can create blockchain
technology-- in fact,

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:17.890
I'm in the process
of doing that,

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:21.370
and I was talking to
Dean Williams about it--

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:24.310
that you could create
a social movement

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:27.700
where you have reward
systems for well-being

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:30.250
and social engagement
and service.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:34.540
And those reward systems could
be recognition from, say,

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:37.900
the Harvard School of Public
Health or opportunities

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:42.910
to serve or get a job in
the area of well-being.

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:48.790
And I think it takes
well-being and democratizes it,

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:52.210
whether it's through
blockchain technologies

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:56.970
of cryptocurrencies that can
it be used as a reward systems.

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:58.660
CAROL HILLS: Give an example.

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.630
DEEPAK CHOPRA: So we create
a well-being community

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:04.120
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.850
And everybody here
is part of it.

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:12.730
And they have access to
it through a private code.

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:16.600
And they share
ideas, and they share

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:21.640
goals, whether it's optimizing
nutrition, weight loss, better

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:26.470
sleep, service to the
community, spiritual practice.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:32.020
In exchange, they get money
for it, cryptocurrency,

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.390
that can be used
only for improving

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:36.882
well-being and service.

00:25:36.882 --> 00:25:38.590
CAROL HILLS: Are there
examples or models

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:42.619
for that approach in other
countries or among populations?

00:25:42.619 --> 00:25:44.160
DEEPAK CHOPRA: It's
a very new model,

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.860
and it's moving very
fast, especially

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.530
among the millennials.

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:54.790
I see a future even for
democracy in the future

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:58.720
globally, where as global
citizens and global citizen

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.680
scientists, we can
contribute both our services

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:07.480
and also get back advice
and participate even

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:13.450
in the electoral process
by voting on values

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:15.637
rather than on personalities.

00:26:15.637 --> 00:26:17.470
CAROL HILLS: And do you
see this translating

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:21.750
among populations
that live in poverty?

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:24.385
Are there ways to introduce
this kind of thing

00:26:24.385 --> 00:26:26.385
among the populations
that-- the people involved

00:26:26.385 --> 00:26:27.070
in public health?

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:29.319
DEEPAK CHOPRA: It's not in
that demographic right now,

00:26:29.319 --> 00:26:32.440
but it could be, especially
in places like India,

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.910
where everybody
has a mobile phone.

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:37.490
So it could be part of that.

00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:44.120
But as far as managing
stress in impoverished areas,

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.260
as Dean Williams knows,
we have a program

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:51.670
in New York in very
impoverished areas.

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:56.680
It's called Urban Yogis, where
regular practices such as those

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:01.080
I mentioned are bringing the
community violence and murder

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.470
rate down just by doing this.

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:05.920
Now, that could be
incorporated, ultimately,

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.710
through a blockchain
technology as well.

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:11.210
But I think for
impoverished areas,

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:13.300
especially in
school systems, it's

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.630
very easy to introduce
some of these ideas.

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:21.340
And meditation doesn't have
to be a complicated process,

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:25.430
or mindfulness doesn't have
to be a complicated process.

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:28.400
It's just getting in touch
with your inner self.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.660
In fact, we could try
an experiment right now.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:31.900
We should take five seconds.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:32.733
Are you game for it?

00:27:32.733 --> 00:27:33.772
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:33.772 --> 00:27:35.230
DEEPAK CHOPRA: Are
you game for it?

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:38.140
So everyone who's
watching us, I'm

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:40.400
going to ask you a question.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.880
And the answer is yes.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:47.110
I'm giving you the answer before
I ask you the question, OK?

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:50.450
So please say yes after
I ask you the question.

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:52.345
Are you aware right now?

00:27:52.345 --> 00:27:52.929
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:52.929 --> 00:27:55.136
DEEPAK CHOPRA: Can you be
a little more enthusiastic?

00:27:55.136 --> 00:27:56.224
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:56.224 --> 00:27:58.047
Are you aware right now?

00:27:58.047 --> 00:27:59.180
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.730
DEEPAK CHOPRA:
OK, now, I'm going

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:02.200
to ask you the same question.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:07.570
But don't answer it till
I lift my hand up, OK?

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:09.610
So same question, and
then you can say yes

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:11.410
when I left my hand up.

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:12.025
Are you aware?

00:28:16.756 --> 00:28:18.167
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:18.167 --> 00:28:20.000
DEEPAK CHOPRA: So are
you aware is a though.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.620
The answer is yes is a thought.

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.740
In between is you as awareness.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:28.880
People are so overshadowed by
their thoughts and perceptions

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.730
and experiences in
the external world

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:34.350
that they never get in
touch with themselves.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:37.990
So now, I'm going to ask you the
same question, are you aware?

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:41.030
And this time, just be aware
of that, which is listening.

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:41.900
Are you aware?

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:51.670
This presence is who you really
are, not your thoughts, which

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:58.820
recycle in social media, but
the presence in which experience

00:28:58.820 --> 00:28:59.950
occurs.

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:04.530
You can stop anytime and
ask yourself, am I aware.

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:07.090
Shouldn't be a
complicated process.

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:08.590
CAROL HILLS: I want
to remind people

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:12.820
that we're going to have
a Q&amp;A from online viewers

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:16.240
and all of you here in
the form of e-mails.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.180
If you want to
email questions, you

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:24.670
can email them to
theforum@hsph.harvard.edu.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:28.930
Or you can post them on
Facebook @HarvardPublicHealth,

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:32.940
or post them on live
chat at The Forum site.

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:36.520
And in terms of introducing
questions, I wanted to--

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.560
we have some
questions in advance

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:41.680
from people who have written
in prior to this event.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:45.620
And this was from Jasmine hall.

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:48.920
And she asks, in some ways,
what I'm trying to get at.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.680
What practical steps can we
take to promote well-being

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.150
to communities
that do not always

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:56.420
have basic needs met,
to be more inclusive

00:29:56.420 --> 00:30:00.770
of socioeconomic status and
less-privileged populations?

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:03.920
DEEPAK CHOPRA: Yes, I think
that's the major challenge

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:08.910
we have both in academia
and outside of academia.

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:10.910
I think it is to
create partnerships,

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:14.090
to create social
networks, to engage people

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:17.840
through social media, but
focus on those three things

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:22.490
that I mentioned,
volunteering, community service

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:26.060
as part of the volunteering,
gathering together

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:29.920
to discuss issues for
the communities of what

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:34.220
are challenges, having
a vision for the future,

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:41.370
and a spiritual or mindfulness
or awarefulness practice,

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:43.100
if I can call it that.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.310
But these movements are
happening right now,

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:48.710
because people are
fed up of waiting

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:52.940
for the government, of
waiting for even institutions

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:54.350
to take action.

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:58.100
And when we discuss well-being
in most places outside

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:01.340
of Schools of Public Health,
it's about insurance.

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:02.960
It's not about well-being.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.580
Health reform is not
about health reform.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:07.190
It's about health insurance.

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:08.150
CAROL HILLS: But
health insurance is--

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:09.540
DEEPAK CHOPRA: --is very
critical, of course.

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:10.370
CAROL HILLS: It's critical.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:11.000
And I would argue--

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.541
DEEPAK CHOPRA: And
we are one country

00:31:12.541 --> 00:31:13.720
where it is unavailable.

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:14.511
CAROL HILLS: Right.

00:31:14.511 --> 00:31:17.810
And particularly in a
country like the US,

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:22.240
it is actually a source of deep
stress if you don't have it.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:24.470
DEEPAK CHOPRA: I mean,
I spent my childhood

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:29.000
in a developing country, and
we never had to think about it.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
We never had to think
about education or health

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.980
or well-being,
because it was taken

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:37.460
care of by the public sector.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.170
CAROL HILLS: Yes.

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:40.085
For some Indians,
but probably there's

00:31:40.085 --> 00:31:41.960
millions of other Indians
who didn't have it.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.190
DEEPAK CHOPRA: Yeah, but
India has a huge volunteer

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:48.832
force as well and more NGOs
than the United States.

00:31:48.832 --> 00:31:50.540
CAROL HILLS: I want
to talk about stress.

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.760
It's a big topic in
your book, and it's

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:56.860
a real concern for people in
the field of global health

00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:00.170
and a concern of Dean Williams
and the School of Public Health

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:01.850
here.

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:04.220
You talk about ways
to reduce stress--

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:06.420
getting out of overdrive,
connecting with nature,

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:09.260
making time for yourself,
confiding in a friend.

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.720
And you talk, as you did
in your opening remarks,

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.560
about how lifelong stress can--

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.910
or managing lifelong
stress can really

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:20.570
reduce the incidence
of chronic disease.

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:21.730
But how do we--

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:24.590
are there examples either
in the United States

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:27.770
or overseas of
other places where

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:31.160
it's, again, outside of
the realm of the individual

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:34.040
who's learning and
taking responsibility?

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.920
Are there health
care systems that

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.280
are addressing stress
and reducing stress

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:44.960
as a primary concern that
maybe the US could look to?

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.080
DEEPAK CHOPRA: There are no
health care systems officially

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:52.040
in the world that are looking at
stress, which is the number one

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:56.180
epidemic of our civilization,
which is directly

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.750
or indirectly connected to
almost every chronic illness,

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:02.210
even risk for acute illness.

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:03.410
So there are no programs.

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:07.100
But there are many
volunteer organizations.

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:09.770
I'll mention one
because I'm close to it.

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:13.550
The Urban Yogis in
Queens, in New York,

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:16.100
they've done a
remarkable job not only

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.680
of improving their
well-being in a very

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.800
impoverished
African-American community,

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.930
but they've become
leaders in their field.

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:26.550
They're now teaching
this to other people,

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:28.130
and the crime rate
is coming down.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:32.030
There's a direct correlation
between social violence

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:34.107
and individual stress as well.

00:33:34.107 --> 00:33:35.940
CAROL HILLS: But crime
rates are coming down

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:37.490
for a lot of other reasons too.

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:38.150
DEEPAK CHOPRA: Say that again.

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:39.170
CAROL HILLS: Crime
rates are coming down

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:40.160
for a lot of other reasons too.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.050
DEEPAK CHOPRA: In this
particular demographic

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:44.110
we're looking at,
we're attributing it

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:50.060
to the self-organization
of the community itself

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:51.357
in this particular community.

00:33:51.357 --> 00:33:52.940
CAROL HILLS: One
thing I wanted to ask

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:56.260
is it seems like in
the '60s and '70s

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:59.140
in its various parts of,
certainly, American history,

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:01.190
there were group
political movements,

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:05.270
and it was the group that was
moving toward political ends

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:07.190
and political ideals.

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:09.739
And for the past 20
or 30 years, it's

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:12.620
really been about kind
of self-realization,

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.929
taking charge of one's self--
whether it's working out,

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:17.330
whether it's fitness,
whether it's mindfulness.

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:22.130
And is there a role for
politics and sort of group

00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:24.800
behavior in trying to achieve
these things since they

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:28.699
are so critical for the
health of individuals

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:30.339
for their entire life?

00:34:30.339 --> 00:34:32.690
DEEPAK CHOPRA: So I
started my career in Boston

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:35.429
in the early '70s.

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:36.679
And there was busing.

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:39.170
There were racial
riots in Boston.

00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:42.210
You probably remember them too.

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:47.520
There were a lot of issues
right then that were emerging.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:50.520
Feminism-- Gloria
Steinem was marching

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.310
the streets of Cambridge.

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:53.949
There was the peace movement.

00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:56.880
There was the green movement.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.560
And in my naive day--

00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.880
I was 24 years old--

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:03.190
I thought we were going to
change the world in the next 10

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.690
years.

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:06.020
And look where we've
gone now, we've

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:09.040
regressed by 60
years I would say.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.780
So we are, right now,
not in a position

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:16.680
where we can say that this
is the ideal situation

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:20.850
for a society or a community
or a nation or the world.

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:25.880
And we need to revive
that kind of zeitgeist

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:30.120
where politics
ultimately will be

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:35.100
influenced by social
opinion or public opinion,

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.480
as it is always.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.030
You see right now
is what is happening

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:41.970
in the political world.

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:46.440
It's being influenced
by social opinion.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.750
And I think in
order for well-being

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:51.360
to be part of the
political arena,

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:56.130
it's young people who
should now be both voting

00:35:56.130 --> 00:36:01.554
and getting involved in the
issues we're talking about.

00:36:01.554 --> 00:36:03.720
CAROL HILLS: I'm going to
introduce another question

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:08.010
from someone who sent it in
in advance, Archana Basu.

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:11.280
She asks, how can current
systems of health in the US

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.710
move to a more
preventative model of care?

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:16.710
DEEPAK CHOPRA: I think
current systems in the US

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:18.930
have to listen to
what is happening

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:20.700
in schools or public health.

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:23.310
Schools of public
health need to get

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:25.680
better funding, which is
not happening at the moment,

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:26.620
by the way.

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:29.070
Even though everyone's
aware that public health is

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:34.270
the number one issue both for
prevention and for prediction

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:37.950
of what happens in a society,
the funding is not happening.

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:42.450
So we need a political
movement in that direction that

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:46.920
can only come from the public.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:50.430
And I think we have an
advantage in the fact

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:52.980
that we can use
social media as well

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:57.180
to bring these ideas to
everybody's attention.

00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:59.370
The internet, if
you look at it, it's

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:01.830
the global brain right now.

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:04.200
And it's a very
active global brain.

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:07.050
You can send somebody a
tweet in South Africa,

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:10.820
and you can give
them a dopamine hit.

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:13.210
Or you can be abusive
on the internet

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:15.070
and raise their blood pressure.

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:19.150
So we are all connected.

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:25.620
We are inseparably woven into
the fabric of being and living.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.780
We are monitoring
each other's brains.

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.360
We are being monitored
by each other.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.760
And we are regulating
each other and being

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.670
regulated by each other.

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:37.320
There's no such thing
as a separate self.

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.740
So even self-realization
and all these movements

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:45.486
that started with it's all
about me ultimately leads to we.

00:37:45.486 --> 00:37:47.550
CAROL HILLS: The me
leads to we, but it also

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:49.120
leads to a lot of stress.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:52.050
I mean, the digital age is--

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:55.650
online life is also
a big distraction.

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:59.769
And so how do we
kind of counter that?

00:37:59.769 --> 00:38:01.560
People are really never
away from work now.

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.310
DEEPAK CHOPRA: Two
things-- one is technology

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:04.350
is not going to go away.

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:06.840
So if you don't like
what's happening

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:12.270
in the world of technology
and social media

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:16.170
and you don't adapt,
then Darwinian principles

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:18.855
say that you will
become irrelevant.

00:38:18.855 --> 00:38:20.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:24.750
So you cannot stop that
technology movement.

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:25.950
How do we use it?

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:27.855
Right now, it's being
used by trolls--

00:38:27.855 --> 00:38:28.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:36.540
--AND by gangsters posing as
political leaders globally.

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:40.300
We need to get involved
in using social media,

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:44.940
SO we can actually bring
awareness about these issues--

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:49.140
violence, social justice,
economic justice, peace,

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:52.060
conflict resolution,
climate change.

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:55.350
This is the best
use of social media.

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:58.020
And I use social media,
rarely prolifically,

00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:59.770
but I have times when I use it.

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:05.100
So I have media time, exercise
time, meditation time,

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:06.340
and work time.

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:10.500
And I do one thing at a
time, because multitasking,

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:11.550
your brain can't do it.

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:13.080
It's a myth.

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.730
Your cortical brain
cannot multitask.

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:19.080
Only your reptilian
brain, which is

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:22.320
taking care of your
autonomic nervous system,

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:25.640
it's already multitasking
anyway without your help.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:30.900
But your conscious choices
have to be made mindfully.

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:34.560
And if you're multitasking, if
you're looking at your phone

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:38.330
and speaking to me at the same
time, you're doing neither.

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:39.660
So it's a myth.

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:41.850
And it's the one
thing that actually

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:45.490
ruins your neural
networks, because they

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:48.880
get confused if you try
to do too many things

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.230
all at the same time.

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:54.780
That's the bane of media
and being seduced by it.

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:56.230
Technology is neutral.

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:58.880
Are you going to use it
for destructive purposes?

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:02.060
Or can you help
create a better world?

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:05.440
CAROL HILLS: I think you and I
and many people in this room,

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.900
we have the luxury,
if we're willing,

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:11.770
to compartmentalize and create
separate spaces for our life.

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:15.220
But again, putting it into
a public health context,

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:18.010
are there other
examples or models

00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:21.010
where these kinds of things are
really being taken seriously,

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:22.750
even at a very micro-level?

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:24.520
DEEPAK CHOPRA: In
the United States,

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.590
everything becomes political.

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:30.860
So if you want to introduce
something to a school system,

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.050
it becomes political.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:34.360
So it's a huge problem.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:39.520
But the best use of
knowledge is education.

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:44.110
And education is easily
accomplished in schools,

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:48.200
and education for
well-being should

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:51.650
be the most important
aspect of education.

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:57.470
The word education, the word
comes from [? "educor" ?] which

00:40:57.470 --> 00:41:01.280
means to bring out what's
already at the core of a child

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:05.052
or a human being, which
is infinite creativity.

00:41:05.052 --> 00:41:06.010
And we're not doing it.

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:09.650
We're giving them information
overload, which right now,

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:11.870
who needs that
with the internet?

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:14.000
We can look up anything.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.390
So it has to be-- public
health and education have

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:18.890
to go together.

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:22.351
In many parts of the
world, education is free.

00:41:22.351 --> 00:41:23.850
CAROL HILLS: And
are there any parts

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:28.260
of the world where that
kind of thinking is going on

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:29.510
DEEPAK CHOPRA: To some extent.

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:32.750
In India, it is
happening to some extent.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:37.430
It's happening in
urban societies

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:43.061
in New York and other
cities, but not enough.

00:41:43.061 --> 00:41:45.560
CAROL HILLS: We have another
question we received in advance

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:48.320
from Marie Andre Lopez-Gomez.

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:51.440
She asked, what is the
role of work in well-being,

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:54.770
and how is the work culture in
the US affecting well-being?

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:56.750
And she adds, are
there any examples

00:41:56.750 --> 00:42:00.440
of work cultures around the
world that offer examples?

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:04.400
DEEPAK CHOPRA: Well, here's the
unfortunately depressing data.

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:10.460
Only 20% of people
in the United States

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:12.560
are fully engaged
in their work, which

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:16.400
means they enjoy
going to work, they

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:19.910
enjoy working with
the people at work,

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:23.870
they are complementing
and being complemented

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:27.140
in their strengths,
they have shared vision,

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:29.810
and they are
emotionally connected--

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:32.090
only 20%.

00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:35.090
80% of people in the
American workforce

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:38.180
are either disengaged
or actively disengaged.

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.340
So disengaged means you
just go because it's

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:41.900
a job you have to do.

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:45.460
Actively disengaged means
that you are unhappy,

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:47.570
and you go to work to
make other people unhappy.

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:50.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:57.040
This costs the United States
about $300 billion a year,

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.540
job disengagement.

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:03.230
Unfortunately, this is true
all over the world, by the way.

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:06.320
There are some countries
where they're ahead

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.430
of the United States.

00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:10.440
If you look at overall
well-being in the buckets

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:13.380
I mentioned-- work well-being,
social well-being, community

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:16.024
well-being, the United States
is about 14th in the world.

00:43:16.024 --> 00:43:17.940
CAROL HILLS: What are
the countries that are--

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:19.280
seem to be doing a bit better?

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:23.577
DEEPAK CHOPRA: Denmark,
Canada, even Panama.

00:43:23.577 --> 00:43:24.410
CAROL HILLS: Panama?

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:25.020
DEEPAK CHOPRA: Panama.

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:26.220
CAROL HILLS: What
are they doing there?

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:27.594
DEEPAK CHOPRA:
Well, I think it's

00:43:27.594 --> 00:43:30.020
a burgeoning economy
right now, and so they're

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:31.890
doing very well right now.

00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:34.650
But there are other
countries Costa Rica,

00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:36.740
other Scandinavian countries.

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:38.870
Of course, if you bring
up the Scandinavian model

00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.990
and these countries--

00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:41.115
CAROL HILLS: They're always
doing everything right.

00:43:41.115 --> 00:43:44.116
DEEPAK CHOPRA: --it becomes
a political issue again.

00:43:44.116 --> 00:43:45.454
[CHUCKLING]

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:51.080
CAROL HILLS: Your
book, The Healing Self,

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:53.270
which I read-- and I'm
actually taking some steps

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:56.380
and trying to reduce the
clutter in my own mind.

00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:59.360
But your book, this
one and others,

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.490
they put a lot of
responsibility on individuals

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:02.990
to take charge of
their health care,

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:05.870
to be an informed,
inquisitive patient.

00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:09.560
You have checklists,
things people can do.

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:14.180
In the public health
sector, should we

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:16.790
be thinking about
it differently?

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:19.010
Is the individual
approach and the burden

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:21.650
of the individual to make
things happen and take

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:23.859
charge, is that the right
approach in a public health

00:44:23.859 --> 00:44:24.358
setting?

00:44:24.358 --> 00:44:25.610
DEEPAK CHOPRA: Not completely.

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:27.980
But of course, there can
not be social well-being

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:30.110
in the absence of
personal well-being.

00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:32.210
That's a given.

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:37.080
But when you have social
engagement around anything,

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:43.080
whether it's losing weight,
or providing a service,

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:48.900
or exercise, or
mindfulness practices,

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:51.510
then the more socially
engaged you can get

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:57.010
and the more you can do
participation in a group,

00:44:57.010 --> 00:45:00.640
the more likely you
are to be successful.

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:04.860
Now having said, that I've
created something which

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:07.100
I call the internet
of well-being,

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:11.940
where I bring together
experts in all these areas

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:15.720
we mentioned, including
conflict resolution,

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:18.480
personal relationship
management.

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.960
It's free, and you get
people to participate,

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:24.540
create their own
groups, and, ultimately,

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:27.480
create a blockchain movement--
which we haven't done,

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.420
but we're in the process--

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:33.420
so that there's a system
where people are rewarded even

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:36.780
for little nudges,
standing up every hour

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:42.690
or making sure that you get
10,000 steps a day or getting

00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:43.590
sleep.

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:48.510
If we can participate as a group
and create a reward system,

00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:49.140
it works.

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:53.940
CAROL HILLS: You've had a
long and storied career,

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:56.510
and you've become your
own brand, really.

00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:58.860
You're this huge figure
in the wellness movement.

00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:02.835
And there's other people,
Andrew Weil and Dr. Oz,

00:46:02.835 --> 00:46:04.210
there's lots of
people out there.

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:06.600
And do you ever
feel like there's

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:09.320
something paradoxical
about that,

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:13.200
of being sort of a brand name
in this field of wellness

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.240
and mindfulness?

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.342
You know what I mean.

00:46:15.342 --> 00:46:16.800
DEEPAK CHOPRA:
Well, fortunately, I

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:19.050
have a wife and kids who
don't take me seriously.

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:21.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:22.770
That helps a lot.

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:24.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:27.990
Secondly, I've
learned over the years

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:31.680
not to believe in
my public persona.

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:36.420
Because for everything that's
said about you that's good,

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:38.220
somebody's saying
something about you

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:40.350
that's the extreme opposite.

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:45.420
So as you grow older, you learn
to handle it in a better way.

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:47.700
And it wasn't planned.

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:50.604
I was planning to be
an internist and--

00:46:50.604 --> 00:46:52.020
CAROL HILLS: Right
here in Boston.

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.520
DEEPAK CHOPRA: Right
here in Boston.

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:54.570
And that's what I did.

00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:58.860
But then, I couldn't help notice
that I had two patients who

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:02.190
had the same illness,
received the same treatment,

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:05.220
saw the same doctor, and had
completely different outcomes.

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:06.540
This person died.

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:08.760
This person
recovered completely.

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.400
So I knew there was
something missing

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:16.680
in our mechanistic
approach to our well-being

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:20.100
or even looking at our
biological organism.

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.440
We were looking at our
biological organisms

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:25.420
as a physical
machine, and it's not.

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:29.000
You can interfere with
mechanisms of disease,

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.710
but if you don't address
the origins of disease,

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:37.330
no amount of mechanistic
interference is going to help.

00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:41.700
So it was my journey, which
was accidental-- neuroscience,

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:45.600
endocrinology, neuropeptides,
mind-body medicine,

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:49.110
integrative well-being, and
now trying to figure out,

00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:51.100
what is it all about?

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:53.100
CAROL HILLS: We're going
to turn to Q&amp;A in about

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:55.450
a minute from online questions.

00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:58.740
But my last question to you
is, what is the research

00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:01.560
that either you're involved in
or other people are involved

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:04.562
in that you're most excited
about in the field of wellness?

00:48:04.562 --> 00:48:06.270
DEEPAK CHOPRA: The
most exciting research

00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:10.470
is what I mentioned,
epigenetics,

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:13.797
where you can see how
your genes are activated

00:48:13.797 --> 00:48:15.380
through every
experience, whether it's

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:18.690
a perceptual experience
or a mental experience--

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:20.130
so epigenetics.

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:25.380
The microbiome, looking at the
two million genes that you.

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:27.780
You have only
25,000 human genes,

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:31.440
but you have two
million bacterial genes

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:35.490
that respond to every experience
but particularly to nutrition.

00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:38.160
So for me, that's very exciting.

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:45.220
And the third is how we
can change and amplify

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:48.880
the coordination between the
reptilian, emotional, and

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:52.930
intellectual brain, which
is my work with Rudy Tanzi

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:54.700
here at Harvard.

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:59.030
Now that he and I have worked
so many years together,

00:48:59.030 --> 00:49:02.290
actually we are so aware of
what's happening in our brain,

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:05.050
even in a conversation
like this,

00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:10.000
I know which part of my brain
I'm looking at right now.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.070
CAROL HILLS: We're going
to move to questions

00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:14.320
that have come in online.

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:18.760
And the first one
is from Emmanuel.

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:22.750
And she asks, what is the
single most threatening problem

00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:25.360
facing a child's health
and security today and

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:26.470
in the near future?

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:28.630
And how can we as
parents and a society

00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:31.390
equip our children to
avoid this problem?

00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:36.260
What can we do today to change
the course of their future.

00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:38.370
DEEPAK CHOPRA: Well,
unfortunately again,

00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:42.890
childhood trauma and
childhood abuse--

00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:45.440
whether it's sexual
abuse, physical abuse,

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.510
emotional abuse--

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:51.000
all leads to problems
in adulthood.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.550
It sets also something
called the brain set point

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:58.000
for happiness or unhappiness.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.370
If a child is given what I
call the Four As-- attention,

00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:08.290
deep listening; affection, deep
caring and love; appreciation,

00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:11.560
noticing the child's
strengths; and acceptance,

00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:15.820
not trying to conform their
behavior to how you think they

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:20.260
should be, acceptance, and
looking at their strengths--

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:24.460
that child will grow up
to be a healthy adult.

00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:30.580
And if a child is in some
way abused or ignored--

00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:35.110
ignored is even worse than,
by the way, being criticized.

00:50:35.110 --> 00:50:37.515
Because ignored means
you don't exist.

00:50:37.515 --> 00:50:40.370
And then, that child will g--

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:44.740
become a dysfunctional
adult emotionally.

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:49.420
May end up winning a
political election, though.

00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:53.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:57.130
CAROL HILLS: Here's a
question from Wi Amin--

00:50:57.130 --> 00:50:59.590
that's the name that's given.

00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:02.774
How do you believe societal
taboos or norms contribute

00:51:02.774 --> 00:51:03.690
to health improvement?

00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:06.700
And how do they hinder
health improvement?

00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:09.100
DEEPAK CHOPRA: Well, when
societal taboos and norms

00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:15.920
become purveyors of
self-righteous morality,

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:21.250
then they interfere
with creativity

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:25.390
and authentic behavior.

00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:28.390
Imposed morality never works.

00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:32.200
So that's where
societal mores and norms

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:37.960
and religious institutions can
cause problem and even abuse.

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:42.070
But many religious institutions
and societal institutions

00:51:42.070 --> 00:51:45.070
actually do a lot for the world.

00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:48.490
Some of the biggest humanitarian
movements in the world

00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:51.340
are actually
religious movements,

00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:54.400
so we should give them credit
for the good that they do

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.500
and the service they provide.

00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:58.300
They are the people
who are working

00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:00.280
in these impoverished areas.

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:02.080
CAROL HILLS: And also,
your own background

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:05.050
and the Ayurvedic
traditions, in many ways,

00:52:05.050 --> 00:52:07.760
come from particularly Indian
cultures and traditions.

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:08.593
DEEPAK CHOPRA: Yeah.

00:52:08.593 --> 00:52:10.960
It's very strong influenced
by the wisdom traditions

00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:13.870
of India, yes.

00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:16.330
CAROL HILLS: Here's a
question from Raphael.

00:52:16.330 --> 00:52:19.570
He asks, what are your thoughts
about cultural appropriation

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:21.940
in reference to Western
medicine starting

00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:24.700
to adopt ideas of
mindfulness, meditation,

00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:26.922
and alternative medicine?

00:52:26.922 --> 00:52:28.630
DEEPAK CHOPRA: I think
it's a great thing

00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:29.640
if it helps the world.

00:52:32.890 --> 00:52:34.540
I look at the
future when I'm not

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:38.650
around where nationalism
or extreme nationalism

00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:44.380
will be considered a tribal
disease, that as we move

00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:47.800
into the future, especially
with the next generation

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:53.500
and the next generation,
we'll be global citizens.

00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:56.950
And we will adapt
to other cultures.

00:52:56.950 --> 00:53:00.580
I have a grandson
right now who is

00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:04.640
a little bit Chinese, a little
bit Indian, and, of course,

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:06.820
he lives in America.

00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:11.260
He speaks Spanish, Hindi,
English, and Mandarin

00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:13.180
at the same time.

00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:15.054
That's the future
citizen of the world.

00:53:15.054 --> 00:53:16.720
CAROL HILLS: He's a
fully-realized self.

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:21.560
DEEPAK CHOPRA: That is
the future of the world.

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:26.770
And so I think we need to go
beyond our tribal behavior.

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:31.810
And I think extreme
nationalism is just tribalism.

00:53:31.810 --> 00:53:33.850
Cultural
appropriation-- cultures

00:53:33.850 --> 00:53:37.040
get richer when they
mix with each other.

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.850
So I'm not one for
total cultural identity.

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:42.720
Culture can be a baggage.

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:47.055
It can also be access to
good food and to good music.

00:53:47.055 --> 00:53:48.000
[CHUCKLING]

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:53.070
But other than that, I think
we need a multicultural society

00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:54.430
and a multicultural world.

00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:57.190
And America is the
best example of that

00:53:57.190 --> 00:54:02.070
so far, unless we
go the other way now

00:54:02.070 --> 00:54:04.449
with our immigration policies.

00:54:04.449 --> 00:54:06.240
CAROL HILLS: Here's a
question from Fatima.

00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:09.060
In your role as a physician
and spiritual guru,

00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:11.220
could you please elaborate
on the interaction

00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:15.070
between mental state
and physical health?

00:54:15.070 --> 00:54:17.850
DEEPAK CHOPRA: You can't
separate mental state

00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:19.320
and physical health.

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:24.160
Wherever the mind goes,
the molecules follow.

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.560
In fact, they're inseparable.

00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:29.310
So this distinction
between mind--

00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:34.290
mental state and physical
state is artificial.

00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:37.290
I can give you bad news,
and your blood pressure

00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:42.630
will go up in a moment if it
affects you, that bad news.

00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:45.810
On the other hand, if
you're feeling appreciated,

00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:50.340
wanted, and loved, you'll
have a different biochemistry.

00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:53.550
Your state of mind
even influences the way

00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:55.860
your food is metabolized.

00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:58.920
So because the
different chemistries

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:02.460
in the body when you're
stressed or when you're relaxed

00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:04.530
or when you're celebrating--

00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:06.710
completely different.

00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:09.990
So there's no distinction
between mind and body.

00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:12.000
We should use one
word, body-mind,

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.810
just the way we use
wave-particle, mass-energy,

00:55:15.810 --> 00:55:17.130
space-time--

00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:19.300
body-mind.

00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:21.750
CAROL HILLS: Here's a
question from Deborah J.

00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:25.110
As a public health professional,
what actionable steps

00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:28.350
can we take to encourage
better holistic and self-care

00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:30.370
for our patients?

00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:33.600
DEEPAK CHOPRA: I think
every physician in the field

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:36.520
should be an educator as well.

00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:39.360
So when I was in
practice in Boston,

00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:41.580
I used to give my
patients a choice.

00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:44.980
I would tell them, I'm happy
to give you a tranquilizer,

00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:46.350
a sleeping pill--

00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:48.250
in those days, an antacid.

00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:51.120
We didn't have these
sophisticated H2 receptor

00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:54.920
blockers or proton
pump inhibitors.

00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:59.820
But I realized very quickly
that 90% of all prescriptions

00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:05.670
were for five things-- pain,
anxiety, nausea, insomnia,

00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:07.990
and constipation.

00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:10.710
If you want to remember
the acronym, it's PANIC.

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:12.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:17.490
P-A-N-I-C. I used to watch
my nurses waking up patients

00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:19.020
to give them sleeping pills.

00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:20.977
Mr. Smith, will
you please wake up?

00:56:20.977 --> 00:56:22.560
I have to give you
your sleeping pill.

00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:24.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:27.360
So all these things are
very easily manageable.

00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:29.010
So I would tell
my patients, I'll

00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:30.700
give you a prescription
if you want.

00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:33.260
But on Friday, I'm going to
give a lecture on well-being.

00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:34.500
Show up.

00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:36.300
And so then I noticed
that more people

00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:39.960
were showing up for the lecture
than for the prescription.

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:43.290
And to physicians out
there in public health,

00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:45.340
you can even charge for it.

00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:47.400
Charge a little bit
for your lectures.

00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:49.840
They'll be valued.

00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:53.100
But make sure they're less
than a prescription in price.

00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:58.230
CAROL HILLS: Here's a
question from Adele.

00:56:58.230 --> 00:57:00.120
What research topics
would Dr. Chopra

00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:02.460
recommend for young
scholars to analyze

00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:06.060
on the interface between
well-being and spirituality?

00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:08.010
DEEPAK CHOPRA:
And spirituality--

00:57:08.010 --> 00:57:11.160
look up a paper called
"Nonduality and Well-Being"--

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.700
"Nonduality and Well-Being."

00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:16.890
It's about the relationship of
spirituality and well-being.

00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:20.010
And basically, it
means that the more--

00:57:20.010 --> 00:57:21.630
you know, what is spirituality?

00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:23.340
It's just the
question I asked you.

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:24.480
Are you aware?

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:27.810
The more self-aware you
are, that's spirituality.

00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:30.040
Don't mix it up with religion.

00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:35.880
The more aware you are of your
inner self, and the more aware

00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:41.850
you are of your mental activity
and your perceptual activity,

00:57:41.850 --> 00:57:45.030
and the more aware you
are of your choices,

00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:46.410
that improves your well-being.

00:57:46.410 --> 00:57:50.821
So spirituality is being
self-aware, period.

00:57:50.821 --> 00:57:53.070
CAROL HILLS: Here's a
question-- it's a long question,

00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:54.670
but you have to
give a short answer.

00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:56.086
Because we're
running out of time.

00:57:56.086 --> 00:57:56.634
Here it is.

00:57:56.634 --> 00:57:58.050
DEEPAK CHOPRA:
Time doesn't exist.

00:57:58.050 --> 00:57:59.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:02.900
It's a human construct.

00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:05.960
No other animal knows
what time it is now.

00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:09.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:11.120
CAROL HILLS: This is from Ida.

00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:12.810
And it's kind of a
serious question.

00:58:12.810 --> 00:58:15.660
Given the ever-increasing
language of hate, exclusion,

00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:18.360
and violence, and its impact
on the many who find themselves

00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:21.360
at the receiving end, how
can we limit the assaults

00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:24.770
and/or help improve wellness
caused by this kind of stress?

00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:29.100
DEEPAK CHOPRA: Yeah, by
the way, it's only obvious

00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:32.100
when you look at the internet,
because the dominant activity

00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:33.750
is that of trolls.

00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:36.840
But by and large, people
are actually out there

00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:40.440
to help each other, to
engage with each other.

00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:43.710
And understand that
relationship is who we are.

00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:46.410
There's no such thing
as a separate self.

00:58:46.410 --> 00:58:49.480
CAROL HILLS: And that's a very
positive note to end this on.

00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:51.650
Our event, unfortunately,
has come to an end.

00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:53.460
It's been a
fascinating discussion.

00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:55.860
I want to thank our audience
both here and online

00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:56.990
for joining us.

00:58:56.990 --> 00:59:00.930
And I thank you, Deepak Chopra
and Dean Michelle Williams.

00:59:00.930 --> 00:59:04.560
You can continue the
conversation at forumhsph.org

00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:08.370
and look for the
on-demand video there

00:59:08.370 --> 00:59:11.190
and on Facebook and YouTube.

00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:13.770
And join The Forum next
time on September 26

00:59:13.770 --> 00:59:18.390
at noon eastern time for a live
webcast about "US Drug Prices,

00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:20.250
Why Are They So High?"

00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:21.270
Thank you so much.

00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:23.070
