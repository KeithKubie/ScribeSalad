00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.380
You create without bullshit. Very important when you recreate,

2
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.283
you have no bullshit.

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.810
So it's Eric wines dying,

4
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.630
not Weinstein. Yeah. I think it was originally van stein.

5
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.770
Van Stein ? Dane. Oh, vine [inaudible] German. Yeah. But uh,

6
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.660
Shah, it was, uh, we,

7
00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:26.661
we came from a town between a Dessa and key of called [inaudible].

8
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.170
And that's where the family, the, the vine stain family came from.

9
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.320
We talked about how many people mispronounce Weinstein instead of Weinstein.

10
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.960
It's, it's epidemic. And yet nobody ever says Albert Einstein.

11
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.160
Yes. That's w yeah. Strange. Right? That is a weird one.

12
00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:51.570
The Einstein is, no, no. Is there a guy named Mike? I'm like, Oh,

13
00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:55.050
Mike Einstein. No, no, no. I N steam. Is there a guy like that?

14
00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.390
[inaudible] do you remember the old, a blazing Saddles with a chore? Mel Brooks,

15
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.260
Mel Brooks,

16
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.260
and a Harvey Korman character was Hedley Lamarr and everyone would call him

17
00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:11.160
Hetty Lamar. That was like the running joke in the picture. That's right.

18
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.260
I fucking loved Mel Brooks movies.

19
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:16.650
Do you remember the Yiddish speaking Indians that had to be the best? Oh yeah,

20
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:19.980
that's right. He had some great movies. Man.

21
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.870
There's fun fucking movies, man. Just silly, fun,

22
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.410
outrageous movies. Yeah. I mean, he was, he was transitional, right?

23
00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:32.250
I guess it was the Borscht belt being updated for the modern era. Yeah.

24
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.240
In the film. But it was also, it was,

25
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.930
you know, for the time, much more contemporary,

26
00:01:39.931 --> 00:01:44.910
but with that sort of Borshbelt sort of Shticky sorta right in the writers'

27
00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:45.241
room,

28
00:01:45.241 --> 00:01:50.241
I guess from Sid Caesar's show of shows was this legendary factory before

29
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:54.870
Saturday night live for all of these kinds of crazy talents behind the scenes.

30
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:59.760
I think he came out of that with Carl Reiner. Ah, that makes sense. He's,

31
00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:01.290
how old is Mel Brooks? Now?

32
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.800
I don't want to ask the question because maybe something will happen. I know,

33
00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:06.000
right? It's one of the,

34
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:10.410
I think I saw recently that he turned 93 and I thought, shit,

35
00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:12.450
is he dead like Melbourne? You know,

36
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.440
because they were saying all these great things. Mel Brooks, I'm like, fuck,

37
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.980
did we lose Mel Brooks? But it's like one of those things.

38
00:02:19.981 --> 00:02:23.700
Where is it? It's going to happen. I mean,

39
00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:28.050
he's 93 I know, but every time it does, I know. I mean,

40
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.330
I guess a WHO, Betty White is another one of these people. Right? Right.

41
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.430
And so we need these very exotic links to our past. Um,

42
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.120
and they become more important as time goes on if they're still vital because

43
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.560
you know, we want desperately to be connected to something before you know,

44
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:47.394
our current era.

45
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.330
Given that I think a lot of us sort of don't believe in anything that happened

46
00:02:51.331 --> 00:02:54.240
before Google. Bright. Imagine kids today.

47
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.040
Imagine trying to describe to kids today what it was like to grow up without the

48
00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.883
Internet.

49
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.410
<v 1>Yeah. Or not being able to reach people.</v>

50
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:06.100
You have to make extensive plans and you know, backup plans. Well,

51
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.400
if you're not there at this time. Yeah. I used to have to yell,

52
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.430
open up your window, yell for your friends.

53
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.900
I remember when I first got an answering machine,

54
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.820
I thought it was the most amazing thing ever. When I was in high school,

55
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.760
my family got an answering machine and I was like, this is incredible.

56
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:24.580
And you would, you would leave like stupid music.

57
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.970
Like to let everybody know you were cool. Like you have some cool music, like,

58
00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:30.640
hey, it's Joe not here right now, but if you leave a message,

59
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.230
I'll get back to you probably.

60
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.700
And then you've got like old people who are, I think,

61
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.500
I think someone in my family still has one of these cutesy messages from like

62
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.650
the late eighties. Really? Yeah. On their voicemail, but then who,

63
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.480
who leaves voicemail and the thing that gets,

64
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:49.640
that marks me as an old person as I actually call people. But that's,

65
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.890
I like that. I've been doing that more lately. Yeah,

66
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.970
I call it a lot of people now. I just feel like it's just, it's better.

67
00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.530
The t the texting thing.

68
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:04.531
The problem is if it's very interesting how we separated ourselves into this,

69
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:06.990
uh, the,

70
00:04:06.991 --> 00:04:11.991
this electronic communication world where I will during the day be in

71
00:04:12.671 --> 00:04:16.240
communication almost constantly with a stream of people.

72
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:19.840
The only thing that stops it is a podcast. Pos podcast is my,

73
00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:24.370
my rest for three hours. I'm not talking to anybody other than you.

74
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.880
So all those texts that come through, I'll get the end of the podcast.

75
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.550
I'll go and look at my phone. There'll be 40 texts sometimes,

76
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.560
like this is madness. If I had to make 40 phone calls, there'd be no,

77
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.980
it would be impossible to manage. It would be a,

78
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.370
I'd be calls would constantly be coming in.

79
00:04:39.371 --> 00:04:41.560
You'd never really be able to say anything. So we're,

80
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.800
we're feeding into this weird loop where we just have these short form things

81
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.310
like, Hey, dinner tomorrow. Sure. What time? How about nine? I can do seven.

82
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.080
Okay, let's do it. You know what I mean?

83
00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:57.220
It's like these weird little bursts of information. You ever see a,

84
00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.120
remember this program, California and what was it called? Uh,

85
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.710
was a Californication television show with the, yeah, with the X. Right.

86
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.130
So there's the scene where he's having some really hot intergenerational sex and

87
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:16.330
this gal says like lol, and it kills it, said it out loud. She said, she says,

88
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.660
lol and he loses total interest.

89
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.840
There's no amount of heat in the moment that can compensate for the fact that

90
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:28.540
she's using like verbal emojis. Hmm.

91
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.890
Well he needs to fucking get over that. How hot she is.

92
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.100
And it also depends on how you say it. If she's really funny and she's like,

93
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.870
lol, you know, and she's like being silly. Like I said, like, you know,

94
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.100
I learned that from, I learned that from Jim Norton.

95
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.190
Jim Norton will always say lol. Like he'll,

96
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.860
he'll say something really ridiculous and then say, lol,

97
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.510
but he's just mocking himself. You're over 50. It's intrinsically ironic.

98
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.930
But you know, in terms of this weird thing about islands of time,

99
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.220
one of the things that we do is have a Shabbat

100
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.720
<v 0>dinner and every Friday, uh,</v>

101
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.750
no matter how atheist and militant people are against any kind of organized

102
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:08.850
religion, they will leave us alone. Uh, when,

103
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.700
if we say we're going into Shabbat. Ah, and so there's this thing about, um,

104
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.730
like people will pester me and all sorts of situations,

105
00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:19.730
but if I invoke something that is vaguely religious,

106
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.260
even Sam Harris probably wouldn't call me during that period of time.

107
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.780
I find that very interesting. Like, could you,

108
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.890
could you create a religion that was simply there to make sure that you had some

109
00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:34.700
time offline? Yeah, I know if I texted bench Piero,

110
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.940
I'm not getting a text back on Saturday and it was dark. Yup.

111
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.190
But when it's dark he texts you.

112
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:42.950
But as soon as there are three stars in the sky, there's been on Twitter.

113
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.730
It's like, what did I miss? That's so weird. It's so,

114
00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:50.360
it's so weird that people buy, I mean, on one hand,

115
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.480
I think it's probably a really good idea to just take a break from all that

116
00:06:55.941 --> 00:07:00.180
electronic shit and just connect with humans in a,

117
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.720
in a very old school type of way.

118
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.880
I think it's probably very good for connect with yourself.

119
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:05.810
I had this experience,

120
00:07:05.811 --> 00:07:10.811
I actually lived in Jerusalem for two years and we landed,

121
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.610
uh, in this orthodox run hotel and on Friday night everything shut down,

122
00:07:16.611 --> 00:07:21.490
you know, like the textbook. And I then moved into a,

123
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.190
uh, uh, an ultra orthodox neighbor, uh, neighborhood, right in the,

124
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.240
on the boundary of, um, a place where the secular and the Orthodox meant.

125
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.990
What was really fascinating to me is I started telling people, you know,

126
00:07:32.991 --> 00:07:34.640
you'd never think that, uh,

127
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.850
it's great not to be able to find a restaurant or a nightclub,

128
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.870
but it's amazing that if this is enforced downtime,

129
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.400
and about a month in somebody said, uh Oh, you're in the wrong place.

130
00:07:46.401 --> 00:07:48.530
Of course you can go out on Friday night. You just go to the,

131
00:07:48.531 --> 00:07:52.040
the Russian Compound and everything's hopping and you can go dancing and

132
00:07:52.041 --> 00:07:52.910
drinking and all these things.

133
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:58.750
After I knew that I went dancing and drinking and I was much less happy than

134
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.390
believing that somehow Israel actually shut down on Friday nights.

135
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.960
And so very weirdly, I appreciated the constraint.

136
00:08:05.961 --> 00:08:07.820
As soon as I knew you could break the constraint,

137
00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:11.840
I was less happy and I would never actually obey it anymore. Yeah.

138
00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:15.300
I think having a rigid rule, even though it seems con,

139
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:20.000
it seems like counterintuitive and that in that like it would provide you some

140
00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:24.650
freedom by having restrictions. But it does, it gives you some freedom. Like,

141
00:08:24.651 --> 00:08:28.220
okay, like now we don't have to think about all these other things.

142
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.470
So now we have the freedom to just be alone.

143
00:08:30.471 --> 00:08:32.060
Now we have the freedom to be relaxed.

144
00:08:32.061 --> 00:08:35.770
Now we have the freedom to just talk to human beings. You know,

145
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:40.900
I think constraints and it's like the do you know Jocko is Jocko Willink.

146
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:45.530
Totally. Everybody knows Jocko. Um, discipline equals freedom.

147
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:48.470
Discipline equals freedom. Doesn't seem like that. Makes Sense.

148
00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:52.910
Like this is up at four 30 in the morning throwing heavyweights around grunting

149
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:55.980
and acting like a savage running goes out to the beach

150
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.630
<v 1>and he earns a sunrise every morning. It goes out and takes photos. You know,</v>

151
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:05.160
it takes a photo of his fucking watch at four 30 hits the gym like a savage and

152
00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:08.310
then takes a photo sometimes with the sunrise earning the sunrise.

153
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:09.000
And you're like,

154
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.810
but you would think God is like a prison to like force yourself into that.

155
00:09:12.811 --> 00:09:13.291
But no, no.

156
00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:16.830
He knows there's freedom in that because he knows he doesn't have to make any

157
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:19.660
decisions at four 30. He knows what he's gonna do.

158
00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.890
He knows what he's going to do. You just, you just go do it. And that way.

159
00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:26.490
I mean, you look at the guy, he's a fucking tank. Why is he a tank?

160
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.160
Cause he's always up at four 30 fucking throwing weights around.

161
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.640
It just doesn't, he never stops. He never, never takes,

162
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:38.030
never takes self-indulgent time to lay in bed and beat off and pick his nose and

163
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.770
fucking check his text messages. Listening

164
00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.080
<v 2>to this right now and thinking maybe I do a little bit of that.</v>

165
00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:48.880
I don't think he does really. Total discipline. Yeah. Well, did you,

166
00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:51.940
I think I remember reading, um,

167
00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:57.240
his inner dialogue about going to a birthday party and breaking down and having

168
00:09:57.461 --> 00:10:00.600
a scoop of ice cream or something or slice the pie and it's like, you know,

169
00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.600
the drama of there. It was temptation.

170
00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:10.300
I held out for 45 minutes, but eventually I became weak. Yeah.

171
00:10:10.301 --> 00:10:14.300
I don't fuck with that. I just do it. I'm going to parties. He backache,

172
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:18.250
you know, I mean I just feel like I do enough. I'm all right. We'll be fine.

173
00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:22.150
There's this story about Jackie o that she got this cancer diagnosis and

174
00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:27.130
apparently her first words upon finding out that she had metastatic cancer was

175
00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.910
then what did I do all those setups for? I'm going to interesting comment.

176
00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.880
That's an interesting comment. She thought somebody needed to talk to her.

177
00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.660
John JFK was keeping her in the dark. Is that right? Yeah,

178
00:10:37.661 --> 00:10:42.400
it must be what's happening over there, Jamie? Something about DV. Um, yeah,

179
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:46.210
like telling her that setups that you want. You want no cancer setups ups.

180
00:10:46.211 --> 00:10:49.120
That's the way to do it, I guess. I don't know. I mean, I think, I think we all,

181
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:55.270
we have so many days of our lives that we build this pattern that this is going

182
00:10:55.271 --> 00:10:57.340
to go on forever. And there is some first moment,

183
00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.480
I think I recall it where the phrase popped into my head.

184
00:11:01.481 --> 00:11:04.900
I can see my death from here and it has to do, you know,

185
00:11:04.901 --> 00:11:06.790
there's like this weird thing when you hit 40,

186
00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:11.770
you start to be able to have analytic thoughts that are uninterrupted by sex

187
00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:17.320
rowing. Yeah. I Dunno. When I, when I turned 40, I found that, um,

188
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.590
some aspect of, uh,

189
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:24.250
thinking too much about sexuality definitely decreased.

190
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.740
And then you start to realize like you're,

191
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.250
when your testosterone starts to go down, you don't feel your,

192
00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:34.790
you don't feel like yourself. Yeah. You become a different thing. Yeah.

193
00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.890
When your chemical composition changes the way your body feels changes,

194
00:11:38.891 --> 00:11:41.530
the way you interface with the world changes. Like I wasn't,

195
00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.830
I wasn't feeling all that great yesterday and I was sort of clowning around with

196
00:11:44.831 --> 00:11:48.910
the person behind the bar at Starbucks and she said, oh, why are you down?

197
00:11:48.911 --> 00:11:51.890
I said, I don't know, just tell me something nice about my hair, you know,

198
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.943
she says

199
00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:58.900
<v 0>it wasn't me. She says, oh, it's, I love salt and pepper. I thought,</v>

200
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.350
Dang. Oh really? Worst is that you're barely salt and pepper.

201
00:12:02.351 --> 00:12:05.570
I can barely see any salt. She's talking about the song. She's both bullshit.

202
00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.140
And you know, she just didn't want me flirting with her,

203
00:12:08.141 --> 00:12:11.470
so she just shut me down by saying, you want me to talk about your hair? Okay.

204
00:12:11.471 --> 00:12:14.770
You crossed the threshold here. Yeah. That's all right. Yeah.

205
00:12:14.771 --> 00:12:17.860
As soon as someone says, say something nice like that could get ugly for a girl.

206
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:20.860
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And she was in a captive situation,

207
00:12:20.861 --> 00:12:23.170
wasn't being fair to her. Oh yeah, right.

208
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:25.690
Does that is the worst when someone's stuck behind a bar,

209
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.030
established a rapport before that? Actually,

210
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:32.110
I actually think she thought it was a kind insensitive comment,

211
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.450
but I don't see any salt. I'm looking now, I'm just fishing John.

212
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.660
Their sounds might be a few,

213
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:43.660
but not like somebody's going to screenshot it and they going to count all the

214
00:12:43.661 --> 00:12:44.530
hairs with arrows.

215
00:12:44.531 --> 00:12:47.260
This is something I've learned when you come on your show that your audience is

216
00:12:47.261 --> 00:12:50.740
so large and active that they will,

217
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.830
they will pinpoint every like timestamp. Yeah.

218
00:12:53.831 --> 00:12:58.030
There's a lot of people in cubicles right now wasting their employer's time to

219
00:12:58.031 --> 00:13:02.260
those people. We solutions you. Cheers.

220
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.820
I should say for the folks at home that before we started this,

221
00:13:06.821 --> 00:13:10.870
you asked me did I want Laird Hamilton coffee and I said Laird Hamilton coffee

222
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:15.190
with [inaudible] coffee and you gave me something laced with turmeric,

223
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:19.810
which may turn our lips funny colors. So if it doesn't not drink it every day.

224
00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:22.360
All right, that's fine. All right. It's really good though.

225
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.330
But it does give you a little phlegm, a little [inaudible],

226
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:30.250
a little bit of that cause it's got all sorts of MCT oil and all sorts of great

227
00:13:30.251 --> 00:13:33.520
stuff in there. Layered Hamilton's a real freak. Really interesting.

228
00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:34.620
What a pioneer. Yeah,

229
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.380
just like just talking to them and hanging out with them and seeing how his

230
00:13:38.381 --> 00:13:42.250
brain works. Like you got to do that. Yeah. I'm on a podcast. Yeah,

231
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.300
it was really, really fun. So did you, what is he, okay.

232
00:13:46.301 --> 00:13:47.680
This is something I'm totally curious about.

233
00:13:47.681 --> 00:13:52.390
I don't Surf because surfing is, in my estimation,

234
00:13:52.391 --> 00:13:54.730
going through some kind of a renaissance right now.

235
00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:00.240
I'm super keen to understand what the series of innovations are given that lots

236
00:14:00.371 --> 00:14:04.030
of other things aren't innovating at anything. Like the surfing innovation rate.

237
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.530
Well the big one is that new type of surfboard. What the hell is that call?

238
00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:12.460
It's like a soil foil. Yeah. Foil. That thing is amazing and it doesn't,

239
00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.460
it's, it's so weird looking. If you look at it, you're like,

240
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.100
why are you standing on? Like why is it elevated?

241
00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:21.850
What's the magic carpet of the sea? Let's be honest. That's what it is.

242
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:25.130
And I am obsessed. I was asking you before, um,

243
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:31.110
there's this Guy Kyle Lennie who for me is just redefining surfing by taking

244
00:14:32.801 --> 00:14:37.780
these monster waves and he's turning them into his private little skate park and

245
00:14:37.781 --> 00:14:42.760
doing tricks off the top of skyscraper waves. And I'm just thinking,

246
00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.100
do you even know what you're doing or where you are?

247
00:14:45.101 --> 00:14:47.050
And he's saying he keeps saying this one phrase,

248
00:14:47.051 --> 00:14:50.950
which is I'm just scratching what blows my mind is I'm just scratching the

249
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.710
surface.

250
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:56.330
He knows that he's making that discontinue to newest jump.

251
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:57.550
And if you,

252
00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:01.640
if you think about sport from the perspective of when did things just change?

253
00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:02.630
Like almost overnight.

254
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:08.270
You know Bob Beamon are arguably is one of the great moments in all of sporting

255
00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:11.150
history and it happens in the long junk just because you have an incremental

256
00:15:11.151 --> 00:15:12.560
sport that suddenly, you know,

257
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.100
somebody jumps a foot more than anyone's ever jumped before,

258
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:19.190
something like that. So it's really interesting when somebody changes the game.

259
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:20.773
It is.

260
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:26.050
And when you find out that there's stuff that you can do and other sports like

261
00:15:26.271 --> 00:15:29.010
skate sports, like different crazy flips and stuff,

262
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.070
when someone figures out how to do that on a wave,

263
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:35.420
the consequences are so fucking grave. If you make a mistake in,

264
00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:39.290
you're on an 80 foot wave and that bitch comes slamming down on you.

265
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.620
But part of the innovation is safety, right? Like with these vests,

266
00:15:42.621 --> 00:15:45.320
inflatable vests and with these water,

267
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:49.910
water safety courses for big wave surfers. Um,

268
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:55.030
I think that what's fascinating is you think the innovation is in the tricks

269
00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.700
maybe, but maybe the innovation is actually in, hey,

270
00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:03.760
you can afford a two way of hold down in a way you couldn't before or you're

271
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.670
going to survive all sorts of things that might've been fatal. Right, right.

272
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:11.990
So you have this open area to innovate. Yeah,

273
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.560
that makes, I mean, surfing's fascinating to me. I don't do it.

274
00:16:15.561 --> 00:16:16.281
I haven't done it,

275
00:16:16.281 --> 00:16:21.281
but I went snorkeling when I was in Hawaii last a couple of weeks ago and I'm

276
00:16:22.431 --> 00:16:26.120
such a pussy. I'm just, uh, I'm, I'm smoking with my kids. Right.

277
00:16:26.121 --> 00:16:28.820
So of course like I'm trying to figure out how to be the,

278
00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:33.680
the mama duck and like corral everybody's off the sharks common. It gets me,

279
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.370
I'm just trying to, I'm just looking around cause some guy got gas,

280
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:38.790
he got jacked. Um,

281
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:43.160
I think snorkeling in Maui just a couple months ago. Oh,

282
00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:47.600
like right off of a resort. Tiger shirt. Probably. Yeah, probably. Yeah.

283
00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.540
Yeah. Well so yeah, some lady got it yesterday, not yesterday,

284
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.520
a couple days ago in, was it The Bahamas? Three sharks.

285
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.360
One took her arm off and the other two just ripped her apart in front of

286
00:17:02.361 --> 00:17:07.340
everybody. Ollege kid from, from California. Well,

287
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:10.190
I'm very interested in situations that change with sharks.

288
00:17:10.191 --> 00:17:11.750
Like reunion for example,

289
00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:16.780
in the Indian Ocean off of Madagascar used to be a surfing hot spot and they had

290
00:17:16.821 --> 00:17:21.560
a bull shark problem where the bull sharks just sort of learned how to eat.

291
00:17:21.561 --> 00:17:22.880
Humans are attack humans.

292
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:28.480
But the great thing is we have got some weird thing going on with the True Apex

293
00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.130
Predator of the seas, which is the Orca.

294
00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.880
We have one recorded bite in the wild ever.

295
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:37.130
Now how does this make any sense?

296
00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:41.480
Like great whites are not apex predators because orchids will just take them

297
00:17:41.481 --> 00:17:45.440
out. And I had this poll on Twitter the other day,

298
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:49.260
which is uh, Orca has colon, um,

299
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.500
best species ever was number one.

300
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.770
Then the other possibility was the dicks of the deep because there's such

301
00:17:55.771 --> 00:17:59.700
asshole. I didn't know that there was a recorded bite of anyone in the wild.

302
00:17:59.701 --> 00:18:02.030
I thought it was all in captivity. No, there's a certain,

303
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.800
there was a surfer who got a bite. Really? Yeah. But you know,

304
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:07.680
on the other hand, how are you going to make contact if you're an Orca?

305
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:11.460
You don't have opposable thumbs. It might be for all I know.

306
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:15.690
I mean look what has to be a joke. Cause otherwise the guy would be dead.

307
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:18.270
I mean if Oracle wanted to kill you and you're in the water,

308
00:18:18.271 --> 00:18:20.580
that's like if you let a an ant go, okay,

309
00:18:20.581 --> 00:18:22.710
but why have orchids never attacked us?

310
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:26.040
There's so many recorded instances of swimmers, paddle boarders,

311
00:18:26.041 --> 00:18:30.960
surfers or ending into orchids. Some weird thing is going on.

312
00:18:30.961 --> 00:18:34.100
And we have to, we have to work this out, Joe. Yeah, let's try,

313
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.080
because we've got, well, first of all,

314
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:41.400
what assholes or way that we have those goddamn things in captivity and a big

315
00:18:41.401 --> 00:18:46.401
fucking shout out to Canada because Canada mostly probably through the noise

316
00:18:46.741 --> 00:18:50.880
that my friend Phil Demars has created in trying to get marine land shut down.

317
00:18:50.881 --> 00:18:55.470
Canada is banned all Orca and all dolphin captivity. It's amazing.

318
00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.200
And I hope the United States does it as well. I hope it,

319
00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.620
I hope it goes worldwide. It's, I think it's,

320
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.850
I think it's slavery. I really do. I think it's a different kind of slavery.

321
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.430
They're almost us. They're like a cross between us and wolves in,

322
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.040
in the [inaudible]. Well, they have,

323
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.290
they just don't have the ability to manipulate their environment,

324
00:19:13.291 --> 00:19:15.210
but they have a cerebral cortex. A dolphin does.

325
00:19:15.211 --> 00:19:18.780
It's 40% larger than the human beings. That's what is going on there.

326
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:21.660
Like the cerebral cortex. So there's thinking happening there,

327
00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:24.490
like really complex, high, really thinking, well,

328
00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:26.580
am I right that they have menopause? Like they're the only,

329
00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:29.730
essentially the only other species with menopause.

330
00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:35.210
And you're only gonna get menopause likely if females are contributing,

331
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:41.250
uh, some sort of intellectual labor past their reproductive, uh,

332
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.060
horizon. How was that? Because well,

333
00:19:45.061 --> 00:19:48.030
I thought menopause was just a shift in the hormonal balance of well,

334
00:19:48.031 --> 00:19:49.740
what is the purpose, uh,

335
00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:54.420
evolutionarily of continuing life beyond,

336
00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:59.310
um, the ability to reproduce? That's a good point because that's doesn't,

337
00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:02.700
that's not the case in mammals and mammals dear in particular,

338
00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:05.160
can breed deep into their old, old age.

339
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.430
If you have a resource that's limiting you,

340
00:20:08.431 --> 00:20:12.780
you'd be better off in terms of systems of selective pressures of shifting

341
00:20:12.781 --> 00:20:16.710
something that is continuing past that point. You know,

342
00:20:16.711 --> 00:20:20.180
this is the old point of it. I think it was Henry Ford who used to go to the,

343
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:25.020
uh, the dump to see what broke down on the cars and what was still working.

344
00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:29.850
And they would transfer materials and resources from things that were dependably

345
00:20:29.851 --> 00:20:33.630
found to work to the things that would be the limiting feature that would break

346
00:20:33.631 --> 00:20:37.590
so that the cars would all break down sort of uniformly at the end.

347
00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:42.290
And you see this like with salmon or salmon disintegrate because it's a discrete

348
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:46.020
heist, a democratized reproductive strategies.

349
00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.650
No Salmon's going to make another run.

350
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.430
<v 1>So you might as well go out in a blaze of glory. Right? Yeah.</v>

351
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:53.920
That's interesting. Um,

352
00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:58.210
they also have a massive infanticide, you know,

353
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.450
that's the horrible thing about dolphins. They're, they're ruthless.

354
00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:05.650
They killed her babies. The male dolphins will kill female dolphins,

355
00:21:05.651 --> 00:21:07.790
babies in order to force them into estrus. Yeah.

356
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:12.830
And that the strategy that the female dolphins have, uh, acquired to, uh,

357
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.880
mitigate that is that they become slots because the male dolphins don't know

358
00:21:18.731 --> 00:21:22.780
whether or not the females baby is theirs because they don't have 23 in me under

359
00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:23.320
the ocean.

360
00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:27.820
So what happens is the female will have sex with as many males as she can.

361
00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:33.330
So that way she's protected and her child's protected because then all the males

362
00:21:33.491 --> 00:21:36.280
think it could possibly be their baby. They don't want to kill their own baby,

363
00:21:36.281 --> 00:21:39.850
which is really interesting that they differentiate because many mammals that

364
00:21:39.851 --> 00:21:44.590
also participate in this don't like bears, don't differentiate between their,

365
00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:48.610
their babies and someone else's babies. So the females in, you know,

366
00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:52.540
if she's carrying around cubs, the male will try to kill and eat the cubs.

367
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.080
So to force her back and asterisks and perhaps just even for food because

368
00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.850
they're so ruthless and cannibalistic.

369
00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:02.020
But dolphins who we think of as our beautiful, charming,

370
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:06.520
wonderful little buddies in the water, they kill babies.

371
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:11.140
They killer whales are of course dolphins. Yes, there are type of Dolphin. So,

372
00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:14.080
you know, the, the issue is, you know, I think about why,

373
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:16.750
why do we not get attacked? It's like professional courtesy.

374
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:21.700
Assholes recognize that. I don't know man.

375
00:22:21.701 --> 00:22:25.360
But every time I go to Hawaii, uh, we, we swim with,

376
00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.520
we either not swim with dolphins, but we're in,

377
00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.080
if you're in a boat and you go fishing,

378
00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:33.100
the dolphins find the boat and they swim with the boat. I've never done that.

379
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.140
Oh Dude, it's here. I'll show you a little video.

380
00:22:35.141 --> 00:22:39.550
It's kind of wild because what they do is they literally go and they hang out

381
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.390
with the wave of your boat. So as your boat is a,

382
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:48.700
as your boat is tuning along, they, they, they ride the wake.

383
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.500
They figure out a way how to do that.

384
00:22:50.501 --> 00:22:53.470
They figured out a way to get in front of the boat and as the boat is pushing

385
00:22:53.471 --> 00:22:55.990
the water, they just sort of like helps them along.

386
00:22:55.991 --> 00:22:58.810
Almost like reverse drafting cause they're kind of in front of it.

387
00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:03.070
So as you're pushing the water, let me find it here. It's really interesting,

388
00:23:03.071 --> 00:23:07.960
man. They're there. An incredible little animal. I mean it's so here it goes.

389
00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:14.230
So that's us in the boat. That's way cool. Yeah,

390
00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.150
no wild. Just wild. They just hang out with you.

391
00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:23.140
I mean wild fucking dolphins, middle of the ocean. They don't know you.

392
00:23:23.141 --> 00:23:24.090
You can be an asshole.

393
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:27.240
They trust you enough to the trying to get our technology. Joe.

394
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.310
They want the boats. I don't think so. You don't think so?

395
00:23:30.311 --> 00:23:34.090
You think we're trapped by that shit. They're laughing herring around all this.

396
00:23:34.091 --> 00:23:36.760
We can do this, can you? Yeah. They don't have to carry anything.

397
00:23:36.761 --> 00:23:41.200
We were carrying everything by ourselves. We're almost useless. Naked. Useless.

398
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.500
We have to have clothes. You have to carry the clothes. You have to have shoes.

399
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:47.670
You got to have a rule. Man, we're extended phenotype guys. Yes. Yeah.

400
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:50.330
They think we're fools. They think we're full. Yeah.

401
00:23:50.331 --> 00:23:51.620
They're out there with free food.

402
00:23:51.621 --> 00:23:54.640
They don't have to worry about carrying credit cards, bitcoin,

403
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:56.810
all that nonsense. They're out there in the ocean.

404
00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:00.890
I bet they have bitcoin and things pointed the deep pash. I don't think they do.

405
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.330
Um,

406
00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:04.940
I think they're probably pretty pissed that we've killed all the fish though.

407
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.340
Yeah. I think that they're actually a little, you know, the,

408
00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:12.500
the org has figured out how to use our fishers or fishing boats and just wait

409
00:24:13.581 --> 00:24:16.490
for us to get stuff on the line and then they like a steal.

410
00:24:16.491 --> 00:24:18.450
Thank you for organizing my dinner. Ha.

411
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:23.180
Well some orchids are not that smart because they're not adapting.

412
00:24:23.181 --> 00:24:28.181
Like there's a particular pod in the Pacific northwest that relies on Chinook

413
00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:29.773
Salmon. Oh yeah.

414
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:34.400
And they're trying to figure out a way cause the salmon populations massively

415
00:24:34.401 --> 00:24:36.170
depleted due to a bunch of different factors,

416
00:24:36.171 --> 00:24:40.070
including they put dams up and they've done a bunch of stupid shit that they

417
00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:40.320
didn't,

418
00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.250
they did a long time ago and they didn't really understand the consequences of

419
00:24:43.251 --> 00:24:46.040
it. And it's really been devastating to the salmon population up there.

420
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:51.370
And Chinook Salmon in particular because this is what these orchids eat.

421
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:52.011
Now,

422
00:24:52.011 --> 00:24:56.510
they also have this migratory pod that comes in that relies on marine mammals,

423
00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:00.020
and the migratory pod is doing great, brilliant. They're doing great.

424
00:25:00.021 --> 00:25:02.210
They're eating all the seals and they're having a good old time.

425
00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.800
But for whatever reason,

426
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:07.520
the pod that stays in that area doesn't want to eat marine mammals.

427
00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:09.080
They only want to eat Chinook salmon.

428
00:25:09.081 --> 00:25:10.790
So they're fucking literally starving to death.

429
00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.770
And I think they read this book on fixed versus growth mindset.

430
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:18.830
And the transitory transient pods are like, Hey, every day is a new day,

431
00:25:18.831 --> 00:25:20.870
we could do something different. The other ones have no,

432
00:25:20.871 --> 00:25:23.840
I'm kind of a creature of habit. You know, they're eating the salmon,

433
00:25:23.841 --> 00:25:24.674
they're coming back.

434
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:28.700
They just have a very specific diet that they just won't deviate from,

435
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:32.450
which I find, I find to be really weird. What is it that pods missing right now?

436
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.370
Cause they probably all dead. They haven't,

437
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.230
they haven't been seen in over three weeks,

438
00:25:36.231 --> 00:25:40.370
which is the longest they have been gone for. Oh, Washington's resonant.

439
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:43.060
Orchids go missing. Oh yeah. I remember that. Like,

440
00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:47.420
no new babies had been born in the Puget sound. I hope. Um,

441
00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:51.710
I hope they're not dead. And that's horrible. I don't know.

442
00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:55.790
I sad because they can't figure out a way how to teach them to eat marine

443
00:25:55.791 --> 00:25:58.700
animals. There's all these different strategies.

444
00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.830
They've tried to figure out a way to teach them to eat seals,

445
00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.700
but they're not interested. And they've also, um,

446
00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:08.550
decided to try to figure out a way to farm raised Chinook Salmon and reintroduce

447
00:26:08.551 --> 00:26:11.840
them to that area. But then again, you know, you don't have to, like,

448
00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:12.960
how do you get,

449
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.820
how do you designate those salmons specifically for the orchids and not for

450
00:26:16.821 --> 00:26:20.450
fishermen. Heck, what do you do when people, you know, they catch fish.

451
00:26:20.451 --> 00:26:24.830
What do you do? Do you tell them, put it back? It's for the Orca. Hmm.

452
00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.440
Yeah. Joanne, I don't have any actual expertise in this area. I mean,

453
00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.720
either I'm just talking him. Well, you know,

454
00:26:32.721 --> 00:26:37.721
we went down to a Hearst castle and there's this elephant seal colony there.

455
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:43.500
And my family decided that this is the worst species ever of mammal elephant

456
00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:44.490
seals. Oh Man.

457
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:48.930
<v 0>They're horrible. Like first of all, in terms of sexual dynamics, you know,</v>

458
00:26:48.931 --> 00:26:50.100
one beach master,

459
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:53.730
he's got a couple lieutenants who are trying to take over his role and the

460
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:57.060
lieutenants seemingly can have sex with one or two of the females,

461
00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:01.650
like not too much, but just enough to keep them happy. Yeah, yeah. Right.

462
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:06.630
And then the beach masters have to fight each other and there are all these dead

463
00:27:06.631 --> 00:27:10.860
babies all over the beach because the giant bowls,

464
00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:15.750
uh, just trample them on their way to fights. Oh, right.

465
00:27:15.751 --> 00:27:20.580
And so then, then you have like the females, if they lose the pup,

466
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.550
they've got to get rid of their milk. So they still somebody else's baby.

467
00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:28.470
So the whole thing, if you transpose like human, if you anthropomorphize,

468
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:30.510
you just think these people are horrible.

469
00:27:30.511 --> 00:27:33.450
This is a crack house on the beach and there's no way,

470
00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:36.720
how do we get some great whites and then remove these mammals immediately?

471
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.280
They're making the family look bad. Yeah.

472
00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:41.670
Maybe we could get the orchestra to eating. That's right. Yeah,

473
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.570
because orchestra, we have a deal. Yeah, and it's a big animal,

474
00:27:45.571 --> 00:27:49.890
so it's a good meal. Look at those dead babies that is so fucked up. All dead.

475
00:27:49.891 --> 00:27:54.450
But it might be, and they are lazy. They are not an industrious,

476
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.940
I mean they are when they're in the sea,

477
00:27:56.970 --> 00:28:00.450
but when they're just on land or they're just laying there. Oh,

478
00:28:00.451 --> 00:28:02.870
they're not dead. They're just chilling. Why they're showing, oh, come on.

479
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.170
You have them. There are a lot of them.

480
00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:08.190
Well you've seen when work is due beach themselves to get those things right.

481
00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:11.640
It's, yeah, it's, well th th th th it's right on the edge.

482
00:28:11.641 --> 00:28:15.770
They hydro the hydroplane on the and then they waddle back in. Look,

483
00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:18.390
I was like scratched up. They are from the ground and everything.

484
00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:23.190
It's a weird looking animal too. What a weird fucking thing that is.

485
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:26.970
William Randolph Hearst was a real piece of shit. He really was. You know,

486
00:28:26.971 --> 00:28:29.310
he's the reason why we have wild pigs in California.

487
00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:34.420
That dip shit imported wild boars and released him on his property.

488
00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:40.890
Okay. So we're driving down the highway and my son says, look dad,

489
00:28:40.891 --> 00:28:45.120
wild zebras. I said, ha ha son. That's very cute. He says, no, no, no. Really?

490
00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:48.840
I look up and there's a herd of wild zebras.

491
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.230
What her's castle has, they closed down the zoo.

492
00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.460
They let the zebras out.

493
00:28:56.461 --> 00:29:00.540
We have a herd of wild zebras in California that no one told me about.

494
00:29:00.541 --> 00:29:05.130
Shut the fuck up. I serious. I've won the Joe Rogan experience.

495
00:29:05.131 --> 00:29:07.020
I finally told you something you don't know anything about,

496
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:12.240
especially about invasive wildlife. That's crazy. So Zebra is in California.

497
00:29:12.241 --> 00:29:16.170
That change your mind a little bit on Mr Hearse? No, he's a piece of shit.

498
00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.520
Alright. He will that he's,

499
00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:20.430
he's one of the main reasons why marijuana became illegal.

500
00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:22.710
Was He smoking too much? Well,

501
00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:26.190
it's all conspiracy theory and conjecture,

502
00:29:26.191 --> 00:29:31.191
but the story is the traditional told by stoners with some education story is

503
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:33.960
that William Randolph Hearst,

504
00:29:33.961 --> 00:29:37.500
along with Harry Anslinger conspired to make marijuana illegal.

505
00:29:37.501 --> 00:29:42.070
When dupont came up with the chemical composition for nylon and

506
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:47.220
<v 3>when it was a combination of several factors and the decorticator was invent</v>

507
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:51.280
decorticator was a way that they could effectively process hemp fiber without

508
00:29:51.281 --> 00:29:52.240
the use of slavery.

509
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:57.840
See the reason why they switched over from hemp clothing and hemp sales and

510
00:29:58.031 --> 00:30:01.000
canvas canvas, which is actually comes from the word cannabis.

511
00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:05.520
All cannabis was made from hemp. Yes. All that stuff is made from hap.

512
00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:10.530
It's far superior to a cotton far superior in terms of a strength in terms of

513
00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:16.990
the durability that was in June. I don't know what Jude is. Judas, what?

514
00:30:16.991 --> 00:30:20.450
Burlap bag like, oh, shoot is way better than that stuff. Okay. No,

515
00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:24.940
hemp is up alien plant. It's hemp. If you had a piece of hemp,

516
00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:29.560
like the stock of Hamp and you cut it into boards like this table that it would

517
00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:32.830
be as hard as this oak, but as light as Balsa wood,

518
00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.130
it's incredibly strange. I, um,

519
00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:41.970
I've seen these like the actual stock of a hemp tree when it gets really big and

520
00:30:43.211 --> 00:30:46.990
you'll have it thick around like, like a man's shoulder. Right.

521
00:30:46.991 --> 00:30:51.220
But it weighs like nothing. It's really strange. It's a strange, strange plant.

522
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:55.120
Not like any other plant. It has all the essential amino acids.

523
00:30:55.121 --> 00:30:59.050
It contains protein. You can cook with the oil,

524
00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:02.650
the oil can sustain you. It's got essential fatty acids.

525
00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:06.790
When do we have to ban it? Oh, it's fucking amazing. Amazing plant. But anyway,

526
00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:11.090
um, they came out with his decorticator and the decorticator because the,

527
00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.070
the way they used to do it,

528
00:31:12.071 --> 00:31:15.730
it was like a very labor intensive process of breaking down the hemp fiber and

529
00:31:15.731 --> 00:31:18.100
turning it into something that you can make clothes within paper.

530
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.840
So Popular Science magazine in, see if you could find the cover of this.

531
00:31:22.841 --> 00:31:27.070
And like the 19, early 1930s, it had a cover set hemp,

532
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:29.270
the new billion dollar crop. Uh,

533
00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:32.590
and because they had this decorticator right.

534
00:31:32.591 --> 00:31:37.591
So we ran off Hearst on top of having Hearst publications.

535
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:41.890
Right. He also had paper mills because you know, he had a,

536
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:43.240
he wanted to make his own paper.

537
00:31:43.241 --> 00:31:45.630
So we had these forests and he had paper and he,

538
00:31:45.631 --> 00:31:49.180
he would make paper out of wood. There is, well,

539
00:31:49.181 --> 00:31:52.360
does it say there's a cover of it though that says hemp hemp,

540
00:31:52.361 --> 00:31:56.110
the new billion dollar crop. That's just the inside part of it.

541
00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:58.180
See if you can find it. Anyway, um,

542
00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:03.160
so William Randolph Hearst would've had to have shift over because hemp paper

543
00:32:03.161 --> 00:32:07.090
and revere played with it. Nope, it's incredibly durable. It's crazy.

544
00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.300
It's a guitar to tear. It's really fucking strong.

545
00:32:10.301 --> 00:32:14.710
Like it's a fucking alien plant. There's nothing like it. It's so weird.

546
00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.180
Like you see a piece of paper, you think,

547
00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:18.640
oh look at this light piece of paper to tear it. No, no, no.

548
00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.650
Fucking really durable.

549
00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:25.810
So they were saying this was going to replace all paper that's made out of wood

550
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:30.220
and William Randolph Hearst was like slowly roll bitches. I got an idea.

551
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:35.400
So he starts putting together all these stories about Mexicans and blacks that

552
00:32:36.491 --> 00:32:40.310
are smoking this drug called marijuana

553
00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.590
<v 1>and they're raping white women.</v>

554
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:47.000
And when Congress made marijuana illegal,

555
00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:50.930
they probably didn't even understand that it was hemp because it was the same

556
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:56.210
goddamn thing. Marijuana was a Mexican slang for tobacco for a while,

557
00:32:56.211 --> 00:33:00.260
tobacco. So they repurposed this name and called it this,

558
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:02.300
this plant called this marijuana,

559
00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:07.250
like it was this gigantic conspiracy so that this fucking piece of shit can save

560
00:33:07.251 --> 00:33:11.090
money. All right? That's really what it was. Cause he had access.

561
00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:14.660
He was like the youtube and the Google of you know,

562
00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:19.310
you belonged with third man. He did believe he had access.

563
00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:24.460
He was the one who could decide what gets distributed and so he that's,

564
00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:28.940
and that was big part of the whole reefer madness film campaign and all that

565
00:33:28.941 --> 00:33:32.210
Shit. All of that stuff was all about economics.

566
00:33:32.211 --> 00:33:33.830
The whole thing was about economics.

567
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:38.540
American farmers are promised a new cash crop with an annual value of several

568
00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:40.640
hundred million dollars. All because of a machine has been invented,

569
00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:44.270
which solves problems in more than 6,000 years old. It is hemp,

570
00:33:44.271 --> 00:33:47.540
a crop that will not compete with other American products. Instead,

571
00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:52.040
it will displace imports of raw material and manufactured products produced by

572
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:56.510
underpaid peasant and Cooley Labor. Cooley labor. Wow. What does that mean?

573
00:33:57.170 --> 00:34:00.350
I don't even know what that means. Let's not talk about it. One means, nope.

574
00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:00.850
Nope.

575
00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:03.770
It will provide thousands of jobs for American workers throughout the land.

576
00:34:03.771 --> 00:34:06.500
So this was all in February, 1938.

577
00:34:06.501 --> 00:34:09.680
They thought they were gonna they were gonna change the world with this shit.

578
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:14.270
And then you had all these people that were a part of the whole prohibition for

579
00:34:14.271 --> 00:34:17.780
alcohol. They just shifted those motherfuckers over to him. I mean,

580
00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:21.410
think about it, it's like over the period of, you know, 10, 15 years,

581
00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:26.120
if you had 10 15 years ago, you know, we're talking about like, um, 2004,

582
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:26.751
you know,

583
00:34:26.751 --> 00:34:30.050
you had bunch of people from the Bush administration that were really into

584
00:34:30.051 --> 00:34:33.590
banning certain drugs and you still have them hanging around. You know,

585
00:34:33.591 --> 00:34:35.210
I'll allow that. That dip shit,

586
00:34:35.211 --> 00:34:37.640
that was the attorney general for awhile with the flux, his name,

587
00:34:37.641 --> 00:34:40.940
that little weasel, that little weasel that Trump got rid of sessions,

588
00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:44.330
that piece of shit, that guy. Same thing. Same thing.

589
00:34:44.331 --> 00:34:47.660
These little weasel for good people don't smoke marijuana. But then little,

590
00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:50.330
you know, he's a viper. He's a viper.

591
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:53.330
Is that what they used to call people who smoked weed back in the [inaudible]?

592
00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.240
He's not smoking weed. He fucked up that. Look,

593
00:34:56.241 --> 00:35:00.770
anytime I see somebody who's really against homosexuality, I set a clock.

594
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.510
Yeah. Right. Yeah.

595
00:35:02.511 --> 00:35:07.190
And you have to ask yourself who in the modern era.

596
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:11.790
Like I found it astounding that when Ilan came on this program and had a blood

597
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:15.410
that like it was an issue. Yeah.

598
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:19.640
And can you imagine if like Elan it had a glass of Chardonnay?

599
00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:23.540
Well he did. Yeah, I know. But the,

600
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:27.940
just the fact that our language and our thought process around this every right,

601
00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:31.080
I see what you're saying. I had a dinner, um,

602
00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:35.760
at our house a while ago where we took some of the most, uh,

603
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:41.470
knowledgeable on psychedelics and related substances to just have a discussion

604
00:35:41.611 --> 00:35:44.790
about what is the state of schedule one pharmacology.

605
00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:49.500
And we asked a question of the, um,

606
00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:51.300
interesting substances.

607
00:35:51.301 --> 00:35:55.590
What are the three that you find were most informative in terms of self

608
00:35:55.591 --> 00:35:59.340
revelation, uh, changing your understanding for the better, et cetera.

609
00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:04.680
I was astounded that of the people who seemed to be very knowledgeable about,

610
00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:08.290
uh, mind altering substances, almost everyone put, uh,

611
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:11.620
cannabis in the top three. My, because it so well I,

612
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:15.390
I thought it'd be sort of commonplace, you know, I wouldn't have guessed,

613
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:19.650
you know, somebody would say five Meo DMT. Somebody else would say ketamine.

614
00:36:19.651 --> 00:36:22.350
Somebody else would say, um, you know,

615
00:36:22.351 --> 00:36:26.250
LSD or DMT or I WASFA. Um,

616
00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:31.410
but the common thread throughout all of these people who were many of them were

617
00:36:31.411 --> 00:36:33.180
researchers, um,

618
00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:37.980
was that they felt that cannabis was miraculous substance. Well, it certainly,

619
00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:42.930
well the deal is it has two different forms, right? As a smokable form,

620
00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:46.830
which you know, you can get really fucking high or it has the edible form,

621
00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:51.810
which is like a psychedelic, but it's like a psychedelic,

622
00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:55.530
very much so. It actually is more psychoactive. There's,

623
00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:58.980
there's something called 11 hydroxy metabolite, that old,

624
00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:03.720
it's only precedent when you eat it. I say it's processed by the liver.

625
00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:07.290
There's something called a onepass and when it goes through the liver produces

626
00:37:07.291 --> 00:37:11.370
this 11 hydroxy metabolite that's somewhere between four and five times more

627
00:37:11.371 --> 00:37:12.810
psychoactive than THC.

628
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.960
And it's responsible for people thinking that they got dosed.

629
00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:19.080
Like a lot of times when people eat edibles to go like, oh my God,

630
00:37:19.081 --> 00:37:23.040
this is in pot, something's in there. Well it's just the 11 hydroxy metabolites.

631
00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:26.940
That's what it is. It's nomadic. Yeah, it's way different. It's way different.

632
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.690
Like that's why it's confusing to people like, oh I can't fuck with edibles.

633
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:32.070
It's a different drug.

634
00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:37.250
It's a different drug because 11 hydroxy metabolite is not present in

635
00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:40.710
psychoactive form when you smoke it. So when you eat it,

636
00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:45.740
that's when you get that really fucking weird body high and interdimensional

637
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:49.260
relationship. Is it better, worse? It's more interesting.

638
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:52.080
Well for the tank it's Bueno.

639
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:55.230
It's the best for the isolation tank. That's my favorite.

640
00:37:55.350 --> 00:38:00.250
My favorite is a good stiff dose of an edible of an edible and then you know,

641
00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:04.170
wait about 45 minutes and then get in the tank so cause 45 minutes.

642
00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:08.430
It's like the way I describe it as like with certain psychedelic drugs and I do

643
00:38:08.431 --> 00:38:10.710
consider edible marijuana psychedelic,

644
00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:14.400
especially when you get into the hundred milligram,

645
00:38:14.401 --> 00:38:15.990
200 milligram doses.

646
00:38:15.991 --> 00:38:20.991
It's very psychedelic and especially in the tank because in the tank when in the

647
00:38:21.481 --> 00:38:24.930
absence of any visual stimulation you're, when your eyes are closed,

648
00:38:24.931 --> 00:38:29.580
you have these wild, almost like neon visuals like I start,

649
00:38:29.581 --> 00:38:34.581
you start seeing these strange dancing cartoons and like weird,

650
00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.490
weird shit unrelated

651
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:38.140
<v 3>to other substances.</v>

652
00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:43.000
You can get similar situations on other psychedelics,

653
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:47.680
especially in the tank that the tank is a really unique way to experience

654
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:51.340
anything. Even even normal psych,

655
00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:54.040
like the normal state,

656
00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:59.220
the normal state of consciousness that you have without any drugs at all inside

657
00:38:59.231 --> 00:39:01.120
the tank, it transforms, right?

658
00:39:01.121 --> 00:39:04.470
Because in the absence of any sensory input and you don't have anything coming

659
00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:05.710
your way, you don't feel your scan,

660
00:39:05.711 --> 00:39:10.711
your brain starts really getting free and loose and you start,

661
00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:15.610
you, it gets very confusing as to what's reality and what's not.

662
00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:17.600
What are the boundaries of, of,

663
00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:22.440
of vision and interpretation and just creativity. Like what,

664
00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:25.840
how much of this is your imagination? How much of this is not what you,

665
00:39:25.841 --> 00:39:29.740
when you add any sort of psychedelic to that tank experience,

666
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:32.740
everything gets ramped up. It's like, you know, it's like, you know,

667
00:39:32.741 --> 00:39:36.070
you add some drugs when you mix them with other drugs,

668
00:39:36.071 --> 00:39:39.340
they become like way more potent that what happens in the tank.

669
00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:44.340
The tank in and of itself is some kind of a drug or it produces some kind of

670
00:39:44.471 --> 00:39:48.970
profound drug like effects. Like can it be banned? The tank,

671
00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:52.840
I don't think you can have you, how much experience you have with the tank. Uh,

672
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:54.730
not much. How many times have you done it?

673
00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:58.960
I've been in once and it was when I was a teenager comment, you should have one.

674
00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:02.620
You really should. It's just a great way to relax too. It's a great way.

675
00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:06.750
And you as a mathematician, you think of things and your con you,

676
00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.700
you're spending a lot of time contemplating things and you have to realize that

677
00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:12.070
any other input,

678
00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:16.390
whether we think about it or not is chewing up some bandwidth.

679
00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:18.100
Although I actually

680
00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:21.440
<v 2>heavy kind of ambient level of distraction,</v>

681
00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:26.240
which is how most helpful for look when I get out there I get way the hell out

682
00:40:26.241 --> 00:40:29.870
there and see like an ambient level of distraction sometimes. For example,

683
00:40:29.871 --> 00:40:34.730
I'll go to an all night cafe at like two in the morning and there'll be just

684
00:40:34.731 --> 00:40:39.380
enough human, I mean, I have very ambiguous feelings about humans.

685
00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.270
Don't worry, I don't consider you one. What are you,

686
00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:49.810
what do you consider yourself? We'll talk about this one. Oh No,

687
00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:53.570
I really think that in many ways I've left this planet. Really? Yeah.

688
00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:58.190
I think that there's a way in which I've checked out how so. Well, um,

689
00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.120
I think that, um,

690
00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:06.830
when you get deep enough into your own mind and you start dealing with

691
00:41:06.831 --> 00:41:10.340
abstractions and you find that the real world, I wasn't planning on going here,

692
00:41:10.341 --> 00:41:14.290
but we can try. Um, when you find that the real world, uh,

693
00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:19.040
is often a kind of noisy, um,

694
00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:24.340
place to think and that you actually prefer really powerful abstractions and

695
00:41:24.411 --> 00:41:26.180
then you check in with the real world to say,

696
00:41:26.181 --> 00:41:28.610
does that abstraction actually govern the world that I'm in?

697
00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:33.350
You start to prefer, um, living in the abstractions.

698
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:34.880
That's interesting. Like,

699
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:38.210
do you feel the same way about like a crowded nightclub?

700
00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:42.350
Like if you go to a bar and do you, do you find that that stimulates thinking?

701
00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:46.490
Well, it depends. I mean, if I'm in a stimulating conversation,

702
00:41:46.491 --> 00:41:50.090
I'm very present. Hmm. If I'm in an unstimulating conversation,

703
00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.340
I have to make my own fun. Right.

704
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:56.780
And so I will start to sort of play, I mean, you know,

705
00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:01.760
at times I'll just make up a story and see how it flies. Um, you know,

706
00:42:01.761 --> 00:42:06.410
if I don't think I'm hurting anybody and sometimes I'll sort of experiment with

707
00:42:06.411 --> 00:42:10.550
people, I think we'll all do it. You experiment with people.

708
00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:14.150
Well sure. Like you like say something to someone to see if they bite. Well,

709
00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.820
you know, it's like, let's, let's imagine for example,

710
00:42:16.821 --> 00:42:18.500
you were going to move to Austin. Okay.

711
00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:21.410
Are you going to just be the same old you?

712
00:42:21.411 --> 00:42:24.560
You're not going to take the opportunity to perhaps reinvent yourself.

713
00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:27.770
So for example, um, you know,

714
00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.050
if I suddenly change,

715
00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:35.090
if I start wearing glasses and I wear like a really fashion forward pair of

716
00:42:35.091 --> 00:42:39.320
spectacles, you should wear aviators with yellow lenses like hunter s Thompson.

717
00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:41.960
I would like that. I like that with you. With your crazy hair,

718
00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:46.610
you would some yellow aviators and don't even address it, Tony. I'm in public.

719
00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:50.360
Yeah, I'm indoors. But if I do any sort of alteration, like maybe,

720
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:52.870
maybe I've never seen my, what I look like with a bald head.

721
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:55.610
So if I were to Mitch, if I was going to move cities,

722
00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:00.440
when's the best time to try it? Try something new. Right. And so you know,

723
00:43:00.441 --> 00:43:05.240
at our, at our age, Joe, yes. Um, how old are you? 53.

724
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:08.300
Yup. That's all right. Yeah, I'm 51, almost 52.

725
00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:13.200
So w the great danger is complacency. And so I, I,

726
00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:17.530
I'm terrified about becoming complacent. So I always want to experiment chain.

727
00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:20.960
Like what is it that I could continue to do to grow?

728
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:26.000
And if you can't play and experiment, like maybe,

729
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.400
you know, imagine you wanted to,

730
00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:33.390
you wanted to go by Joseph and just to see whether it worked, you know,

731
00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:38.330
whatever it is, we get so locked in and if we change anything,

732
00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:39.980
people get angry.

733
00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:45.010
And I've always looked at Madonna and David Bowie as like genius squared.

734
00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:52.700
Not only did each iteration of them do something that was kind of artistically

735
00:43:52.701 --> 00:43:56.900
interesting, but they habituated their audience for change.

736
00:43:57.230 --> 00:44:00.230
And so the idea is that every time you, you met a different David Bowie,

737
00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:02.450
you know, he would effectively say,

738
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:04.910
do you like this incarnation of me because it's not going to be,

739
00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:08.930
it's only here for one year and then I'm going to do something new.

740
00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:13.310
The next time there just had, um, conversation with Sean Linen,

741
00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:19.170
um, in which we talked about how his father, John Lennon, uh,

742
00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:20.330
always kept changing.

743
00:44:20.331 --> 00:44:24.440
And yet people want to plug in with the idea that John Lennon was just the guy

744
00:44:24.441 --> 00:44:28.400
who wrote, imagine let's say. Right. And that's,

745
00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:31.890
that's a great dangerous that if you think about like your, somebody will say,

746
00:44:31.891 --> 00:44:34.680
well, you know, it didn't you in 2014 tweet

747
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:38.220
X. Gotcha. It's like, well, yeah,

748
00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:41.550
maybe you have 10,000 tweets and maybe you changed. Maybe,

749
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:45.000
maybe new information came in. So yeah,

750
00:44:45.001 --> 00:44:48.960
that is a weird thing about pulling up thoughts that you had from a decade or

751
00:44:48.961 --> 00:44:53.340
more ago and trying to put them on you today.

752
00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:57.030
Yeah. And pretend. And if you say, I don't think that way anymore,

753
00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:02.430
people don't want to accept that they will because it's a disingenuous

754
00:45:02.431 --> 00:45:03.151
conversation.

755
00:45:03.151 --> 00:45:06.570
They're not really trying to find out what you think they're trying to get you.

756
00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:10.890
It's more interesting. For example, um,

757
00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:14.220
there's been a ton of pressure. We can get to this in a second too.

758
00:45:14.221 --> 00:45:18.800
For me to address the question of the IDW, is it still alive? Is it in trouble?

759
00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:23.280
National Dark Web. Yeah. So it is the intentional,

760
00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:28.500
the dirt dirt bag with the, um, let's come back to that.

761
00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:32.580
When Cher did this, a remake of,

762
00:45:32.581 --> 00:45:36.770
I got you babe with Beavis and butthead. You took this, remember,

763
00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:40.110
cause she had this duet with Sonny Bono and then she got into a bad thing with

764
00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:40.981
sunny and so she said,

765
00:45:40.981 --> 00:45:45.690
I'm going to rerecord the song and I'm just going to torch it right now.

766
00:45:45.691 --> 00:45:50.400
The problem is somebody had that as their wedding song, right?

767
00:45:50.401 --> 00:45:53.310
Beavis and butthead. No, no, no. Was sowing. Yeah. Oh, let me see.

768
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.650
We probably did it with Beavis and butthead, but there's some punk.

769
00:45:55.651 --> 00:46:00.510
They don't care. People from Florida. That one right. That's Florida man. He's,

770
00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:02.523
um,

771
00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:07.770
the problem when you change things is that other people wed themselves to where

772
00:46:07.771 --> 00:46:11.190
you were. So when you pull up and you say, yeah,

773
00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:14.610
I don't think that that's just wrong. I was confused man.

774
00:46:14.611 --> 00:46:17.280
I was going through a dark time and I probably was saying stuff I should,

775
00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:18.720
if you do that right,

776
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:23.750
anybody who sort of invested in that version of you and integrated that into

777
00:46:24.001 --> 00:46:27.960
their lives is now angry. They're upset. Wait a minute.

778
00:46:27.961 --> 00:46:30.890
You pulled the rug out from under me. And so you know,

779
00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:33.630
in part with what Bowie and Madonna did is they said, look,

780
00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:39.330
these are stages and if you like that stage, that stage is yours.

781
00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:40.860
But I'm not staying there.

782
00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:45.480
And I think that that's sort of the more responsible way of doing it is that

783
00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:49.260
you're allowed your evolution, but you have to let people know, um,

784
00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:52.470
I'm going to do something totally different from time to time.

785
00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:57.150
Or I like the idea of doing things that are just do it, just do it. Yeah.

786
00:46:57.151 --> 00:46:59.520
Don't try to explain yourself constantly.

787
00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:02.370
They didn't explain themselves like they just,

788
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:05.610
they did it in a clear enough way that people could understand the pattern.

789
00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:07.980
And so you know, for example,

790
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:10.530
and this is something that I think would be kind of interesting to talk about,

791
00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:12.100
um,

792
00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:16.080
everybody is losing their mind at the moment in the space that you and I sort of

793
00:47:16.081 --> 00:47:21.081
Co and habit of ideas and trying to figure out how do we remain sane and plugged

794
00:47:21.421 --> 00:47:25.260
in and open hearted and open to new things but also rigorous and fair,

795
00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:30.040
like all of these weird pressures, the ideas behind intellectual dark web

796
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.780
<v 1>that you coined this,</v>

797
00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:35.950
this concept of having a bunch of people that have different ideologies but yet

798
00:47:35.951 --> 00:47:40.951
share this common theme of wanting to have real honest communication and honest

799
00:47:41.141 --> 00:47:42.910
conversations and try to figure out,

800
00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.400
instead of looking at things from an ideological perspective,

801
00:47:45.401 --> 00:47:49.600
look at things from an honest objective point and try to see the way other

802
00:47:49.601 --> 00:47:51.700
people view things but hearted and not,

803
00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:56.730
not trying to destroy each other and effectively trying to become the adults in

804
00:47:57.131 --> 00:48:01.450
the room as we watched the kids run riot. Right? And, and, and not always,

805
00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:05.920
not always achieving that now because I refuse to actually say what it was or

806
00:48:05.921 --> 00:48:08.260
who was in it because there was a lot of pressure to codify it.

807
00:48:08.261 --> 00:48:12.490
And I knew that if I codified it, uh, it would die. I want a membership card.

808
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:15.750
You have, you have one. But if I don't, if I don't get one, you have what?

809
00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:19.950
There's a clubhouse. We just don't tell the members where it is because it's,

810
00:48:20.290 --> 00:48:23.800
there's an article about the IDW that doesn't mention me. I'm like, yes,

811
00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:28.420
yanking away. Yeah, I'm slipping away, but I like Pachino in three.

812
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:31.600
He's going to drag you back. There are,

813
00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:35.410
there's been some discussion about certain members and certain people that are

814
00:48:35.411 --> 00:48:38.620
losing their fucking marbles. Yeah. I think it's pressure, you know,

815
00:48:38.621 --> 00:48:42.370
and I think, um, one of the things that we're all recognizing from,

816
00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:47.080
whether it's the internet and the, or just celebrity in general,

817
00:48:47.081 --> 00:48:49.720
which I think part of the culprit is,

818
00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:53.410
especially if you're reading comments and articles that are written about you,

819
00:48:53.411 --> 00:48:57.970
which I do not recommend if you are doing that and doing that. Don't do that.

820
00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:02.520
If you're doing that, you are subject to a massive amount of pressure. Yeah,

821
00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:06.670
it's a lot of pressure and sometimes people they apply that well.

822
00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:09.610
Sometimes that pressure can help you.

823
00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:14.640
Like if it's a good friend or a someone who you trust and it's done with

824
00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:18.940
intellectual honesty and they just really,

825
00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:23.680
they think that there's a maybe a flaw in your thinking or maybe this could help

826
00:49:23.681 --> 00:49:27.340
you or maybe this is an issue and then you realize that and you self correct.

827
00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:28.443
That's great.

828
00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:32.860
But there's a lot of people that are bending to the will of the masses and they

829
00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:35.590
also are responding to the pressure of the mass.

830
00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:40.620
I don't even think it's the massive [inaudible] reasons I read my comments is

831
00:49:40.631 --> 00:49:43.390
because I want to know what Russia's thinking that I'm not kidding.

832
00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:47.440
Listen to me, Joe. Here we go. Let's go down the rabbit hole together for sure.

833
00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:49.210
And we went and we talked about this recently,

834
00:49:49.211 --> 00:49:50.580
let me just say this before you get going. Yeah,

835
00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:53.860
we knew that something was going on years ago.

836
00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:58.330
I used to have a message board and a on my message board or my website.

837
00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:01.300
Um, it became problematic for legal reasons.

838
00:50:01.301 --> 00:50:03.490
People were putting a bunch of illegal shit up there and I was kind of

839
00:50:03.491 --> 00:50:06.580
responsible for them. A few issues came up where I was like, oh Jesus,

840
00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:08.380
I'm going to, I'm going to get in real trouble.

841
00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:13.650
We had an influx and by an influx I mean thousands and thousands of Russian

842
00:50:15.431 --> 00:50:18.010
emails signing up for my message board.

843
00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:23.310
I mean thousands with really similar email addresses and they would post and

844
00:50:24.941 --> 00:50:28.340
pretend they're from fucking Cleveland or post and be mad

845
00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:31.940
<v 3>that we don't have enough Nazis on or whatever, whatever the fuck it would be,</v>

846
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:36.500
you know? Right. It would just be just same thing that the IRA was doing,

847
00:50:36.501 --> 00:50:39.370
the Internet research agency was doing with Facebook and Google and Twitter.

848
00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:43.370
We were seeing this like four or five years ago that this stuff was kind of

849
00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:46.070
happening where they were recognizing that the disease,

850
00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:49.100
large portals of discussion. And so they,

851
00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:53.120
they're trying to manipulate that discussion and turn certain discussions toxic

852
00:50:53.121 --> 00:50:54.620
and certain and you know,

853
00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:59.270
and come up with preposterous conspiracy theories and attack people for

854
00:50:59.271 --> 00:51:00.650
nonsensical reasons.

855
00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.100
<v 2>Well this is the thing,</v>

856
00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:07.130
I keep seeing the same message modified a hundred different ways from a bunch of

857
00:51:08.491 --> 00:51:11.370
accounts that have suspicious similarity.

858
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:14.670
Not One of these accounts usually is followed by anyone I care about.

859
00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:18.660
And then they have a few high value accounts with blurry photographs.

860
00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:20.410
Have a person that like I,

861
00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:24.240
I think somebody like putting real money into that account to create a fake

862
00:51:24.241 --> 00:51:29.241
person who just dog doggedly follows you and is constantly trying to talk to you

863
00:51:29.881 --> 00:51:30.840
in your ear that account.

864
00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:34.100
<v 3>But how do you know that that's what that is and how do you know it's not just</v>

865
00:51:34.101 --> 00:51:38.150
some person that schizophrenia that really is really interested in Eric

866
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.480
Weinstock?

867
00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:42.460
<v 2>Couple Times I've tried to like talk to the person, ah,</v>

868
00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:45.640
and suddenly the thing vanishes. It's like, you're so disgusting.

869
00:51:45.641 --> 00:51:48.440
I would never talk to you. It's like goodbye click. It's like, oh,

870
00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:52.340
maybe they just panicked. It could be just a person. Well, that's the thing we,

871
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:55.930
we, you never know. On the other hand, um,

872
00:51:56.090 --> 00:51:59.080
you remember when we took that photograph at that dinner, um,

873
00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:05.520
there was this huge number of jokes about Ben Shapiro in a booster seat that

874
00:52:06.041 --> 00:52:09.010
were all slightly different versions of the joke and all of the accounts.

875
00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:13.300
We were like strikingly similar. [inaudible] I was thinking like, well, I,

876
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:18.610
I could imagine a little bit of this, but it's way too many,

877
00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:22.120
and this is part of what I believe.

878
00:52:22.121 --> 00:52:27.121
I believe that we are in a new world in which a lot of the grassroots stuff is,

879
00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:32.080
is astroturf. And if you start to listen to it,

880
00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:34.980
you start to get pushed. And I start to watch certain tactics.

881
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.790
I make models of the tactics. You know, like one of the tactics is, Gosh, Eric,

882
00:52:39.791 --> 00:52:44.070
I once thought that you had a lot of integrity and now I know that x, you know,

883
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:48.910
if you don't, if you don't address this situation, I'm done following you.

884
00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:53.320
It's like, oh, really, goodbye click. But,

885
00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:55.840
uh, I believe that, um,

886
00:52:56.500 --> 00:53:01.090
I believe that there are sophisticated players who are engaged in trying to

887
00:53:02.410 --> 00:53:06.850
either boost our signal or start to alter the signal.

888
00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:09.740
Somebody will be up, somebody will be down. Uh,

889
00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:13.000
and then there's like really weird dynamics. Um,

890
00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:17.860
I think that there's a very strange thing going on, not with Dave Ruben,

891
00:53:17.861 --> 00:53:22.861
but with the crowd of people that is just trying to eat Dave Ruben and blind him

892
00:53:23.381 --> 00:53:26.190
and confuse him. And this, uh,

893
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:29.790
<v 0>you know, this, this Guy Sam Cedar, who do you think he's a Russian?</v>

894
00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:33.480
I hope he is. Well, I don't know. I don't think he's Russian,

895
00:53:33.481 --> 00:53:37.590
but I do think that his, his, I think he has a grassroots following.

896
00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:42.600
I don't think this is inauthentic that just loves to,

897
00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:48.030
um, dark harass, well dunk drag. I hate this language.

898
00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:51.330
I just kept thinking I liked the word Dunkin. Oh really? Yeah. It's fun. No,

899
00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:56.130
I'm not. I'm not a fan. No, no, no, because it's just a cheapens all converse.

900
00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:59.280
Oh, you got dunked on, you got dragged. It's just like,

901
00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:02.160
oh this is that thing in third grade that I never figured out.

902
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:06.810
Well they found out that he won't engage with them and so they think it's cute

903
00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:08.430
to just constantly shit on them.

904
00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:13.020
And they also think it's cute to take anything that he says and interpret it in

905
00:54:13.021 --> 00:54:18.021
the worst possible way possible and not think of it as him just being a guy

906
00:54:19.141 --> 00:54:24.141
who's trying to talk about things on the fly and maybe isn't even prepared about

907
00:54:24.271 --> 00:54:27.180
the subject at hand. Like one of the things that comes up on this show,

908
00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:28.330
like you know,

909
00:54:28.330 --> 00:54:31.200
we were talking before we were going to go on there where we're going to talk

910
00:54:31.201 --> 00:54:35.400
about, I'm like, come on, let's just talk. Yeah. And so when you do that,

911
00:54:35.401 --> 00:54:36.810
come on, let's just talk thing.

912
00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:39.030
You never know what the fuck is going to come up.

913
00:54:39.031 --> 00:54:44.031
And you might have a piss poorly formed idea of what a subject is and you just

914
00:54:45.451 --> 00:54:48.740
start rambling. This is what I've done in my two previous of,

915
00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.480
well no you have not. But it seems, you know,

916
00:54:51.481 --> 00:54:55.860
it's easy to think that you did that, but with Dave, um,

917
00:54:57.210 --> 00:54:58.043
you know,

918
00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:03.170
there's enough moments where he's misstepped where they just feel like,

919
00:55:04.141 --> 00:55:07.710
okay, we got a wounded antelope. Yeah, they're trying to pick him off.

920
00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:08.670
And you know,

921
00:55:08.671 --> 00:55:12.630
I think there was probably a move to do Shapiro and there was a period where you

922
00:55:12.631 --> 00:55:16.410
were seemingly in the cross hairs but your heart to kill. And you know,

923
00:55:16.411 --> 00:55:19.230
I have no doubt that I was in the crosshairs. I wouldn't even notice it. See,

924
00:55:19.231 --> 00:55:22.380
that's the, that's the benefit of not paying attention.

925
00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:26.280
And this is something that I've been pretty rigorous about over the last six

926
00:55:26.281 --> 00:55:31.281
months or years to Sam Harris and Dave Ruben have all given me versions of this

927
00:55:31.411 --> 00:55:32.040
advice.

928
00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:37.040
And I worry about it because I'm not large enough yet that I've been the target

929
00:55:40.051 --> 00:55:41.370
of a steady campaign.

930
00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:46.400
But what happens is you see people's feedback loops interrupted and in part to

931
00:55:48.931 --> 00:55:51.570
course correct, you kind of want to know what's like,

932
00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:52.680
was I too harsh with that guy?

933
00:55:52.681 --> 00:55:55.590
Like when I went on with Jordan Peterson a on Dave show,

934
00:55:56.040 --> 00:56:00.870
I was more aggressive because I think I'd seen Jordan and Brett on your show

935
00:56:00.871 --> 00:56:05.340
together. And, uh, I come from an ethnic family, we interrupt each other,

936
00:56:05.341 --> 00:56:10.110
that's normal and Jordan is an interrupter. And so, um,

937
00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:11.150
what I found is,

938
00:56:11.151 --> 00:56:15.570
is that I probably was intuiting that I had to be more forceful and a lot of the

939
00:56:15.571 --> 00:56:18.480
comments. Wow. Eric, I haven't really seen you this aggressive.

940
00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:21.000
Was there three of you on the conversation?

941
00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:26.030
It started off Dave Jordan and myself and then Ben Shapiro came in for an hour

942
00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:30.500
and I think Sam Harris might've been, uh, scheduled to come in. I don't know.

943
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:34.240
Remember there's an issue always with more than one person.

944
00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:37.460
There's a reason why I do one-on-ones almost exclusively. Like,

945
00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:42.250
even when I had Bob Lasar with Jeremy Corbell, uh, just,

946
00:56:42.251 --> 00:56:46.630
just having a third person that wants to chime in like oftentimes interrupts the

947
00:56:46.631 --> 00:56:47.590
flow of conversation.

948
00:56:47.591 --> 00:56:52.010
Like in that case it was because I wanted to lock in on Bob Lasar, right.

949
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:55.510
I wanted to get all my feedback. I want to find out is this guy full of shit?

950
00:56:55.570 --> 00:56:57.940
Like what I want, I want to lock in with them.

951
00:56:57.941 --> 00:57:01.690
And there's another button and also, and also this is another person.

952
00:57:01.691 --> 00:57:05.110
Even if they have a good thing to say, it's a distraction. It becomes a problem.

953
00:57:05.111 --> 00:57:07.360
You never know when one of these is going to work. And when one of the,

954
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:10.660
when it works, it can be magical. And when yes, when it doesn't, you know,

955
00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:13.150
it's a little bit like jazz guys.

956
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:15.730
If that group is meant to be,

957
00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:18.700
then they don't trip over each other solos that are trying to come up with

958
00:57:18.701 --> 00:57:21.730
something. Even with three great friends, I have this issue.

959
00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:24.580
I mean it just some great stuff with multiple people on your show.

960
00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:26.950
And I've seen stuff that doesn't work. And you know, the other,

961
00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:29.530
the other night we had, um, uh,

962
00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:33.160
Brian Callan is fast becoming one of my favorite people in the world and he had

963
00:57:33.161 --> 00:57:37.090
us over. Um, and it was really fascinating.

964
00:57:37.091 --> 00:57:40.780
It was all guys who could rip your head off, not your head off.

965
00:57:40.810 --> 00:57:43.990
They could certainly rip my head off and very thoughtful ones at that.

966
00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:49.150
There were people from all different ethnicities. My wife was the only female.

967
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:54.280
And one of the things I found astounding was that everybody was taking the piss

968
00:57:54.281 --> 00:57:58.180
out of each other. And it was the most intimate, positive,

969
00:57:58.210 --> 00:57:59.740
loving kind of, uh,

970
00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:03.010
an environment you could imagine where people are joking about each other's

971
00:58:03.011 --> 00:58:04.390
ethnicity, their religion.

972
00:58:05.050 --> 00:58:10.050
And I had to remind myself about how men actually manage intimacy and closeness.

973
00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:18.360
And it's not the way women do it and appreciate on each other and we shit on

974
00:58:18.431 --> 00:58:22.900
each other. And it's frigging important to how we do business.

975
00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:27.790
And increasingly I have this idea that I need that in my life. Well,

976
00:58:27.791 --> 00:58:31.030
we have to check each other to see if each other's taking each other seriously.

977
00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:34.240
You have to make sure you're not taking yourself too seriously.

978
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:37.390
I didn't feel like lots of jokes were made at my expense.

979
00:58:37.391 --> 00:58:40.130
I was probably the only guy there who wasn't, you know, uh,

980
00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:44.350
some form of a combat, uh, sport veteran. And, you know,

981
00:58:44.351 --> 00:58:46.240
there were a couple of jokes at my expense on that.

982
00:58:46.241 --> 00:58:50.830
There were a couple of Jewish jokes. I felt terrific leaving that place.

983
00:58:50.831 --> 00:58:54.470
There was no part of me that felt like, wow, I really got Hayes,

984
00:58:54.471 --> 00:58:55.840
but I hope I got through it. I mean,

985
00:58:55.841 --> 00:58:58.990
these guys were just so positive and generous of spirit.

986
00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:01.960
And Brian is one of the best of that. He's so silly.

987
00:59:02.170 --> 00:59:07.170
Like most of his podcasts that he does with me and him have pretty cool

988
00:59:07.391 --> 00:59:09.850
podcasts. We've known each other for ever.

989
00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:14.170
We've been best friends since 1994. Is that right? Yeah,

990
00:59:14.650 --> 00:59:17.680
I mean guys, that guy is smart.

991
00:59:17.681 --> 00:59:21.800
I love him so much that I broke up with this girl. And, uh, Brian,

992
00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:27.080
<v 1>um, she was, she was calling me because she was horny and I was like, look,</v>

993
00:59:27.081 --> 00:59:30.470
I have a new girlfriend but I have a friend. Oh, fuck you.

994
00:59:30.471 --> 00:59:31.430
And he's just like me.

995
00:59:32.650 --> 00:59:36.230
So this I sick Brian on my ex girlfriend and he fucked her.

996
00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:39.560
One of the funniest conversations I ever had with an ex girlfriend.

997
00:59:39.561 --> 00:59:43.940
She calls me up and she goes, your friend came inside me and I went, what?

998
00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:47.870
She goes, yeah, your fucking friend came inside me. And I was like, well,

999
00:59:47.871 --> 00:59:50.990
did you tell him that you were on the pill? She goes, no, no,

1000
00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:54.170
I'm not on the pill. And I was like, well, I don't know what to tell you.

1001
00:59:54.350 --> 00:59:56.690
You know, that's prion. You guys should have worked that out.

1002
00:59:58.550 --> 00:59:59.780
But I'm an ex girlfriend.

1003
01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:05.050
Call you up mad because your friend ejaculated inside of her.

1004
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:07.810
It was one of the most, I hung up the phone.

1005
01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.890
I literally fell to the ground laughing.

1006
01:00:09.891 --> 01:00:12.000
I was lying on my back on the floor and my house going

1007
01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:20.120
like, it's just so ridiculous as Brian Callan, Brian Cal, everywhere.

1008
01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:23.950
So I called him up and I said, did you, what happened? And he's like, whoops.

1009
01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:28.670
It was just such a ridiculous conversation.

1010
01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:33.150
But I've been friends with that guy forever. So all of our conversations,

1011
01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:33.750
so like that.

1012
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:38.750
I see all of our conversations are like jokes and hazing and shitting on each

1013
01:00:38.901 --> 01:00:43.550
other. But it's all hugs and love. I mean I'm just so positive and generous.

1014
01:00:43.551 --> 01:00:45.380
And you know, one funny thing,

1015
01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:50.640
I was looking at his Instagram and he's seated next to, I don't know it.

1016
01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:56.150
I can't remember it. Was it Cheetah? I'll say to a wild cheetah. Yeah.

1017
01:00:56.151 --> 01:00:57.830
And he's talking about how you have sex with it.

1018
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:03.230
I like to get up in the morning, perhaps we will hug together.

1019
01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:08.230
I smell antelope nearby. He's clarity. There's an extra,

1020
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:12.500
a real cheetah. Yeah, Cheetahs are interesting. Then you can actually pet them.

1021
01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:15.290
It's weird. I didn't know it was a game reserve.

1022
01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:19.190
I see like a one of the items so far. No, no, no.

1023
01:01:19.191 --> 01:01:23.000
I mean a lot of that is in Africa. I'm not in terms of like, like they're,

1024
01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:27.500
they're not pets. Yeah, but they're so used to people.

1025
01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:30.500
Cause people were always going on safari there and apparently you can get real

1026
01:01:30.501 --> 01:01:33.470
close to them in some environments. But Cheetahs in particular,

1027
01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.770
a lot of people keep them as pets. Like you see like a lot of sheikhs,

1028
01:01:37.070 --> 01:01:38.840
like rich guys in the Middle East.

1029
01:01:39.110 --> 01:01:42.290
They'll be driving around and their fucking AMG wagons with a,

1030
01:01:42.291 --> 01:01:46.020
a cheetah next to them, cheat on a leash and the cheetahs just cool with it.

1031
01:01:46.210 --> 01:01:48.140
See nobody, nobody, nobody does that with hippos.

1032
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:52.100
I think if you want to go next level, yeah, that wouldn't work out.

1033
01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:55.910
Hippos just decided to fuck you up. Yeah. What is with us in the hippos,

1034
01:01:56.270 --> 01:02:00.650
hippos are like, they're a cousin, two pigs and then they're right. Yeah.

1035
01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:05.030
They're a ruthless fucking animal. Oh, now I see it. They don't play any games.

1036
01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:08.630
Yeah, and for Vegetarians it's not even like that where their food,

1037
01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:13.880
they are vegetarians, but they do eat meat. I know their kid will soda deer,

1038
01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:16.460
you know, deer and cows, they'll eat birds. I can.

1039
01:02:16.461 --> 01:02:19.070
We're not going back into that vampire deer thing that, no, no.

1040
01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:22.680
Freaked me out last time. But dear often times eat birds.

1041
01:02:22.830 --> 01:02:25.470
The ground nesting birds. There's a lot of video of it.

1042
01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:27.570
Like people don't want to believe it. They think that, you know,

1043
01:02:27.571 --> 01:02:29.580
they just eat grass most of the time they do.

1044
01:02:29.581 --> 01:02:33.600
But they will eat a bird if they get a chance, you know, they know it's food.

1045
01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:36.770
Yeah. It's weird. Yeah.

1046
01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:40.320
And they have an herbivores that just have track but they'll still eat a bird.

1047
01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:42.090
There's a lot of videos. Deer.

1048
01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:47.330
I guess I've been really fascinated by the number of species in which some human

1049
01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:51.270
like totally deadly species where some human is decided I'm going to dedicate my

1050
01:02:51.271 --> 01:02:53.970
life to hanging out and not getting eaten. Hyenas,

1051
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:58.290
there's some asshole that a is uh, he's, he's hanging out with hyenas on the,

1052
01:02:58.291 --> 01:03:01.530
on the internet and pet them. They, they seem really playful and friendly.

1053
01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:06.710
Real sweet thrill. Weird. This guy is like nuzzling these hyenas.

1054
01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:10.190
Imagine choosing the high. That's your system. I said,

1055
01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:13.800
that is an animal that bites so fucking hard. They have,

1056
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:17.690
they have like one of the strongest bites ever measured because their,

1057
01:03:17.691 --> 01:03:21.960
their whole thing is just smashing bones and trying to get out the nutrition

1058
01:03:21.961 --> 01:03:26.370
that the lions leave behind. So they're all just about crushing bones.

1059
01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:30.140
So their whole face is designed to smash bones. Yeah.

1060
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:34.140
And you know, they're, they're fucking, so here's the guy,

1061
01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:37.680
he's hanging out with these hyenas. He plays with them. Look at this asshole.

1062
01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:41.140
But they, they're playing with them. They're,

1063
01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:45.510
they seem to think he's like their buddy. Look, they're all there biting him,

1064
01:03:45.511 --> 01:03:48.780
but they're gentle. I mean they get rip his arm clean off,

1065
01:03:48.781 --> 01:03:52.080
but they're biting his leg and you know, he's nuzzling with them.

1066
01:03:52.110 --> 01:03:55.260
He's letting you write his face. I do not know. I do not know.

1067
01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:59.070
Cause I think a lot of these have to do with imprinting. Oh yeah, for sure.

1068
01:03:59.071 --> 01:03:59.341
Yeah.

1069
01:03:59.341 --> 01:04:02.970
Well that was the thing with my friend Phil Demars who worked at marine land.

1070
01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.430
One of the reasons why he's so furious at damage,

1071
01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:10.200
cause he's got a walrus named smooshing and the Walrus imprinted with him when

1072
01:04:10.201 --> 01:04:13.260
it was really young. But walrus thinks that's his mom. Okay.

1073
01:04:13.410 --> 01:04:16.260
That he's rather the Walrus. His mom, you know,

1074
01:04:16.261 --> 01:04:21.261
so he's just on this fucking furious quest to get this walrus released and to

1075
01:04:23.821 --> 01:04:27.570
shut down the shit hole known as marine land. Yeah.

1076
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:29.190
He's been sued forever.

1077
01:04:29.191 --> 01:04:31.980
He's been involved in lawsuits as long as I've known him and he's been coming on

1078
01:04:31.981 --> 01:04:34.320
this podcast for years, for years.

1079
01:04:34.321 --> 01:04:37.470
We've been trying to boost his signal and trying to get the word out.

1080
01:04:37.471 --> 01:04:42.471
And then when blackfish came out that sort of really turned the tide where

1081
01:04:42.631 --> 01:04:45.900
people got a chance to see what Orca captivities really like.

1082
01:04:45.901 --> 01:04:50.820
And they were like, Holy Shit, this is horrific. It is absolutely barbaric.

1083
01:04:51.570 --> 01:04:55.590
But, um, anyway, his, uh, that's, that's uh, his,

1084
01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:59.820
this wall was come from him. He gave me that. It's cool that, yeah,

1085
01:05:00.330 --> 01:05:04.990
that sits there for Phil, that, that sits on the desk for Phil who is,

1086
01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:08.280
who is the, uh, Hall of fame here in the desk. Is there a camera over there? Oh,

1087
01:05:08.281 --> 01:05:12.690
this is, um, this, uh, these are all little, um,

1088
01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:14.393
little,

1089
01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:19.690
little statuettes from a company called Plasta cell [inaudible] and a plastic

1090
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:23.020
cell is, how do you say phone's name? Fom Tran.

1091
01:05:23.610 --> 01:05:28.090
He's an amazing artist who's created all of these. A little, little,

1092
01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:33.010
little figurines. This is Rory McDonald who's a elite UFC fighter.

1093
01:05:33.011 --> 01:05:37.540
Bruce Lee, notorious B. I g. That's my dog. Marshall Marshall has one.

1094
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:40.930
That's me, a Tupac, Conor McGregor, Kanye.

1095
01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:45.160
And then that is a different one. The bobblehead one that's rich rebuilds.

1096
01:05:45.161 --> 01:05:47.890
He's got this really dope um, uh,

1097
01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:51.910
really dope website or youtube channel where he,

1098
01:05:51.911 --> 01:05:55.900
he's the only guy that I know of that's ever rebuilt a Tesla.

1099
01:05:56.110 --> 01:05:56.980
He bought a wreck,

1100
01:05:56.981 --> 01:06:01.630
Tesla and then bought another one and put the parts together and figured out how

1101
01:06:01.631 --> 01:06:04.390
to make it work. And the Tesla people do not like him.

1102
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:05.560
They don't like these doing that.

1103
01:06:05.561 --> 01:06:09.400
And now he's made a place called the electrified garage in Massachusetts where

1104
01:06:09.970 --> 01:06:14.970
he is working on Tesla's in electric vehicles outside of their ecosystem.

1105
01:06:15.521 --> 01:06:19.090
So he's doing it on his own, like an independent way. Slum, Massachusets,

1106
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:22.810
you think he's going to hybridize with Boston dynamics? No,

1107
01:06:22.811 --> 01:06:25.540
he's an independent guy. That would be cool. He's not,

1108
01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:29.830
how do you say his last name? Ben Wa right. It's been, it looks like Benoit,

1109
01:06:29.831 --> 01:06:33.340
but it's been wa very cool guy. He was on the podcast recently. Hey,

1110
01:06:33.341 --> 01:06:34.174
what happened?

1111
01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:37.690
What do we know about the Kanye situation where he's going to talk about mental

1112
01:06:37.691 --> 01:06:42.040
health? I was kind of excited about that. I, you know, if he wants to,

1113
01:06:42.041 --> 01:06:46.030
he can do it. I'm not, yeah, don't, he's, he's, uh, he's his own thing.

1114
01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:49.630
He is a brilliant artist,

1115
01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:52.720
but oftentimes with brilliant artists, it's not,

1116
01:06:52.721 --> 01:06:55.810
this is not the best format for them to just talk.

1117
01:06:56.110 --> 01:06:59.080
Like sometimes it's better for them to express themselves through their work.

1118
01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:01.960
Maybe. Although I found, you know,

1119
01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:07.050
I spent two days with him and I found that when he's in a relaxed,

1120
01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:13.040
um, frame, his flow state is just, it's beautiful. Well,

1121
01:07:13.041 --> 01:07:15.100
I enjoy talking to him. I talked to him on the phone.

1122
01:07:15.101 --> 01:07:17.530
I really enjoyed our conversation and a nice conversation. He said,

1123
01:07:17.531 --> 01:07:21.250
I think he's a very good dude. Very sensitive Human Viagra. Very cool guy.

1124
01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:26.020
But this is Donald relaxed environment. You know this right here,

1125
01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.420
everybody knows how many people are listening.

1126
01:07:28.421 --> 01:07:30.940
It's just if fuck people's head up really.

1127
01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:36.010
Cause the illusion that I have is just you and me talking and then I come out of

1128
01:07:36.011 --> 01:07:39.550
here and people are like, what did you do? You said, well you and I are friends.

1129
01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:44.580
So that illusion is more maintained when you don't know me and you come in and I

1130
01:07:45.821 --> 01:07:46.910
mean I would have to be friends with him,

1131
01:07:47.010 --> 01:07:49.270
but so that's one of the things he wanted me to come to his church. You know,

1132
01:07:49.271 --> 01:07:52.000
he's got, he's running a cult essentially. Everybody's wearing white.

1133
01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:56.230
They're all dancing and doing religious stuff. I do that. Yeah. Busy man.

1134
01:07:56.850 --> 01:08:00.850
So you're busy Sundays. Your family time is your family. Well I'm not into,

1135
01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:04.120
I just, I get it. I think it's beautiful, you know, but I'm not,

1136
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:07.300
he and I were walking down the road and you know,

1137
01:08:07.301 --> 01:08:11.500
there was this crippler which has got the crib crips from Long Beach. He said,

1138
01:08:11.501 --> 01:08:14.140
you know, Kanye, you better stay in Calabasas.

1139
01:08:14.170 --> 01:08:16.020
It was like a little bit of a tense situation. So

1140
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:19.130
<v 0>we're walking along the road and like,</v>

1141
01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:23.030
people were hanging out of the windows of their car. You're like, God, Yay.

1142
01:08:23.190 --> 01:08:26.150
And I think it was just like positive, you know, like when I make contact.

1143
01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:30.770
But it was very disconcerting and this guy was preternaturally call,

1144
01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:36.440
you know, he was just like [inaudible]. I was nervous. How long ago is this?

1145
01:08:36.650 --> 01:08:41.610
This was, you remember when you went on TMZ? Well, the,

1146
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:45.050
the we talking a year or less. I think it was probably a year ago.

1147
01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:49.280
It's probably medicated. Not Anymore. Oh, is that right? Yeah. Yeah.

1148
01:08:49.281 --> 01:08:53.480
He talked openly about the fact that last six months or so he's been off of his

1149
01:08:53.481 --> 01:08:56.600
medication and he,

1150
01:08:56.630 --> 01:09:01.490
whatever they had him on was fucking with him creatively. Well, do you remember,

1151
01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:02.210
um,

1152
01:09:02.210 --> 01:09:07.210
all of her sex had this chapter in the man who mistook his wife for a hat about

1153
01:09:07.401 --> 01:09:09.990
a drummer with Tourette's syndrome now.

1154
01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:14.120
And then he took a drug to control the Tourette's syndrome and the guy's

1155
01:09:14.121 --> 01:09:18.320
drumming became kind of monotonous. Very regular, but like not creative.

1156
01:09:19.130 --> 01:09:22.850
Yeah. You look the, what that guy has gotten inside of him.

1157
01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:25.700
He's so prolific. I mean, you listen to his music,

1158
01:09:25.701 --> 01:09:29.870
it's so interesting and eclectic and prolific and he's just constantly turning

1159
01:09:29.871 --> 01:09:32.870
out more great shit. He doesn't have any flops.

1160
01:09:32.871 --> 01:09:37.490
I mean his music is pretty fucking amazing and he's just, that's his shit man.

1161
01:09:37.491 --> 01:09:41.990
He knows how to just get in there and create and he's got this whirlwind going

1162
01:09:41.991 --> 01:09:44.260
on in his mind. He's fearless. He's,

1163
01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:47.000
he is explore and only get into the details.

1164
01:09:47.001 --> 01:09:51.770
But one of the things that really impressed me was he would go to places that

1165
01:09:51.771 --> 01:09:56.510
I'm too scared to go to in my own mind and just, Oh, just, you know,

1166
01:09:56.511 --> 01:10:01.511
thinking about your inadequacies and externalizing them and your vulnerabilities

1167
01:10:01.611 --> 01:10:05.480
and knowing, you know, what is going to emasculate you.

1168
01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:06.980
And his point is like,

1169
01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:12.940
I'm so comfortable with myself that I'm going to mind that as a source of art

1170
01:10:12.981 --> 01:10:15.200
because I bet it's in everyone. And you know,

1171
01:10:15.201 --> 01:10:20.201
by exploring these contradictions and these false fronts and you know,

1172
01:10:20.271 --> 01:10:23.240
he's, he's kind of a level of internal access.

1173
01:10:23.690 --> 01:10:28.190
I'm actually quite interested in the mental health aspect of this,

1174
01:10:28.191 --> 01:10:31.020
which is there's so much w,

1175
01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:33.740
so much mental unhealth as we as we term it,

1176
01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:37.730
that I don't think it's all mental unhealth.

1177
01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:41.210
I do think that there's something about the artistic process that seems to be

1178
01:10:41.211 --> 01:10:44.540
very informed by states that we call in health. Yeah,

1179
01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:49.780
well we require people to stay inside these rigid boundaries and these rigid

1180
01:10:50.151 --> 01:10:51.690
boundaries there.

1181
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:55.760
They're great if you want to show up at a job and work nine to five and don't

1182
01:10:55.761 --> 01:11:00.500
use certain noises with your mouth because it makes people upset, you know?

1183
01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:03.350
But that's not for the creative process.

1184
01:11:03.351 --> 01:11:05.750
If you look at true outliers,

1185
01:11:05.751 --> 01:11:08.900
if you want to discuss true outliers like people that are really capable of

1186
01:11:09.170 --> 01:11:13.290
producing extraordinary art or architecture

1187
01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:18.840
<v 3>did different interesting things that are part of the creative process.</v>

1188
01:11:19.170 --> 01:11:21.840
Those people are all unwell, every single one of them.

1189
01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:26.440
I mean in terms of like if you made them do what a normal person has to do every

1190
01:11:26.441 --> 01:11:30.420
day. I think normal life is unwell in terms of this,

1191
01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:34.950
this requirement of showing up five minutes early,

1192
01:11:34.951 --> 01:11:39.060
working all day long, getting off, maybe bringing some of your work home,

1193
01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:42.000
getting some sleep, getting up in the morning and doing it all over again.

1194
01:11:42.001 --> 01:11:44.850
All why raising a family and trying to enjoy your time,

1195
01:11:44.851 --> 01:11:47.190
your limited finite time on this planet. Well,

1196
01:11:47.190 --> 01:11:51.300
<v 4>this is why I said I've left. Oh, so you left is that it's not healthy here.</v>

1197
01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:56.070
So where are you? Well, um, maybe,

1198
01:11:56.071 --> 01:11:59.670
maybe this is a good segue, I hadn't thought about it this way, but, um,

1199
01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:04.780
so can we use this format to, uh,

1200
01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:08.400
announce that I am in fact starting the podcast?

1201
01:12:08.401 --> 01:12:13.030
I've recorded a couple boom episodes already, uh,

1202
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:17.250
that are in the cannon. It is, it is called the portal. The portal. Yeah.

1203
01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:23.160
So the portal is, um, refers to this,

1204
01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:28.290
this very interesting, uh, thing that I,

1205
01:12:28.650 --> 01:12:33.360
I thought everyone was aware of, but very often people would react to it.

1206
01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:34.500
When I was a kid,

1207
01:12:34.501 --> 01:12:39.501
I read all of these stories that I thought were known to be the same story,

1208
01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:43.200
but different versions of it. And I called it the portal story.

1209
01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:44.940
And it was always the same.

1210
01:12:44.941 --> 01:12:49.941
Somebody is trapped in a humdrum existence in an ordinary world until some sort

1211
01:12:52.321 --> 01:12:56.580
of magical portal accidentally or on purpose enters their life.

1212
01:12:57.510 --> 01:13:01.260
And either they go through a wardrobe, they go through a rabbit hole,

1213
01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:05.370
the looking glass platform, nine and three quarters, um,

1214
01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:08.570
or you know, Dorothy famously, uh,

1215
01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:12.150
was used to introduce technicolor where she, the first part of the film,

1216
01:13:12.151 --> 01:13:15.280
she's in Kansas and it's in sort of gray scale, black and white. Oh,

1217
01:13:15.281 --> 01:13:15.840
that's right.

1218
01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:19.740
And then she lands and Oz and they opened the door and it's technicolor.

1219
01:13:19.741 --> 01:13:22.920
And there's this transitional scene, um,

1220
01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:25.950
where you see technicolor for the first time.

1221
01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:28.650
Was that the first time I ever in a movie? I believe so and so,

1222
01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:34.410
and so the question is, um, where's the portal?

1223
01:13:34.530 --> 01:13:39.530
Like why do we tell the same story over and over and over again with different

1224
01:13:39.811 --> 01:13:42.390
protagonists? But it's always the same formula.

1225
01:13:42.391 --> 01:13:45.630
It's somebody is trapped in an ordinary world. They're sort of,

1226
01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:46.920
there were around normies.

1227
01:13:47.670 --> 01:13:52.620
They find the portal and the portal becomes the call to adventure and they spend

1228
01:13:52.621 --> 01:13:54.240
time in the alternate universe.

1229
01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:00.560
And then somehow they're able to live very often they return. Uh,

1230
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:02.010
if you remember the phantom tollbooth,

1231
01:14:02.011 --> 01:14:07.011
Milo gets this present of a car in a tollbooth and he goes through the toll

1232
01:14:07.051 --> 01:14:08.990
booth and he, uh,

1233
01:14:09.730 --> 01:14:12.910
I see Norton gesture was the author and Jules Feiffer

1234
01:14:12.910 --> 01:14:16.720
<v 2>was the deal illustrations. It was just this brilliant book, uh,</v>

1235
01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:19.870
where there's like the land of letters in the land of numbers.

1236
01:14:19.871 --> 01:14:23.740
So it's arts and sciences and you know, like there's a,

1237
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.080
there's a person who starts from his head and grows down until his feet reached

1238
01:14:29.081 --> 01:14:31.510
the ground and there's a number's mine.

1239
01:14:31.511 --> 01:14:36.511
And he has to rescue the princesses of rhyme and reason in order to restore

1240
01:14:37.570 --> 01:14:39.550
order between the two kingdoms of the United,

1241
01:14:39.570 --> 01:14:43.590
like left and right hemisphere in some incredibly, uh,

1242
01:14:43.630 --> 01:14:48.370
exciting story. And the idea is that after he goes and does all of these,

1243
01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:53.350
like there's an island called conclusions. And when you make an assumption,

1244
01:14:53.351 --> 01:14:55.660
you leap to conclusions, so you suddenly jump. I mean, it's,

1245
01:14:55.700 --> 01:15:00.400
it's all very clever. Wordplay. And stuff. At the end of the adventure,

1246
01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:06.400
the toll booth disappears because it has to go to the next kid who needs it,

1247
01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:09.790
you know? And so my question was always, why?

1248
01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:13.900
Why on earth would we tell the same story over and over and over and over and

1249
01:15:13.901 --> 01:15:16.660
over again? It has the same format and it's always a different context.

1250
01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:22.560
And I came to believe that this story is actually this unkept promise for most

1251
01:15:24.011 --> 01:15:27.280
people that in their adult lives, they don't find these portals.

1252
01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:32.770
So for example, have you ever been to Barcelona, Spain? No.

1253
01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:35.860
There is a church in Barcelona, Spain,

1254
01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:39.400
which is plenty impressive from the outside when you go inside,

1255
01:15:39.401 --> 01:15:42.700
I've been looking at pictures of my entire life called La Sagrada Familia.

1256
01:15:43.930 --> 01:15:47.560
It is a psychedelic drug trip and a half like you've never seen.

1257
01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:51.160
It is the most bizarre interior space I've ever seen in my life.

1258
01:15:51.161 --> 01:15:54.850
Can you bring up the interior of this thing? Wow.

1259
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:59.860
And on the one hand it induces like a hallucinogenic state.

1260
01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:05.170
On the other hand, it's an idea of what this architect gouty.

1261
01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:08.050
Now Goudy is very famous. He did a lot of buildings around Barcelona.

1262
01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:10.900
There is nothing like the inside of this church on this planet.

1263
01:16:11.530 --> 01:16:15.580
And um, wow,

1264
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:19.630
fuck, that's beautiful. And if you look up at the roof,

1265
01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:22.330
wow,

1266
01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:24.093
<v 5>okay.</v>

1267
01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:26.620
<v 2>And like, you know, most things,</v>

1268
01:16:26.621 --> 01:16:29.590
you're sort of prepared for them your whole life and then you see it and you

1269
01:16:29.591 --> 01:16:31.810
think, Eh, Eh, I guess, I guess that's cool.

1270
01:16:32.610 --> 01:16:35.320
I'd been seeing this thing my whole life and I had no,

1271
01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:42.180
no concept of what a genius this human being was because nothing he did,

1272
01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:46.570
um, go to the outside of it, the outside of it. I mean, look, this guy,

1273
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:49.000
if he never did the inside of this church,

1274
01:16:49.001 --> 01:16:52.450
he would be a very famous and idiosyncratic architect. Wow.

1275
01:16:52.990 --> 01:16:56.890
But are they doing work on it there? They haven't finished it yet. In fact,

1276
01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:57.753
he's such a,

1277
01:16:57.850 --> 01:17:01.330
he's such a genius that they can't finish it in the style that he started it

1278
01:17:01.690 --> 01:17:04.660
because nobody knows. It's like an unfinished symphony. What would you do?

1279
01:17:04.661 --> 01:17:08.980
Nobody's smart enough to finish the this church. Wow. Look at that roof on that.

1280
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:13.470
Okay. Now that is a portal that is a portal, right?

1281
01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:17.430
And when we, when,

1282
01:17:17.431 --> 01:17:20.670
when I was on this program before, you know, I thought long and hard,

1283
01:17:20.671 --> 01:17:25.671
what is it that I could push out to the planet to let people know how wonderful

1284
01:17:27.871 --> 01:17:29.670
and beautiful the world that we live in is?

1285
01:17:29.671 --> 01:17:33.500
And we pushed out the hop vibration and suddenly if you were caught,

1286
01:17:33.501 --> 01:17:36.540
I said to people, this is the most important object in the universe.

1287
01:17:36.541 --> 01:17:40.950
Not The hop vibration in particular, but the class called the principle bundle,

1288
01:17:41.370 --> 01:17:46.020
which people have no idea it's out there and it is the basis of the construct in

1289
01:17:46.021 --> 01:17:46.854
which we live.

1290
01:17:47.550 --> 01:17:52.550
So how is it that a normal human being can make contact with real physics,

1291
01:17:53.850 --> 01:17:57.210
uh, with, you know, real beauty of biology or you know,

1292
01:17:57.211 --> 01:17:59.580
just understanding order, symmetry,

1293
01:17:59.610 --> 01:18:04.500
all of these things that are beyond normal experience. And

1294
01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:11.160
what I hope to do with the podcast is to have amazing guests and interesting

1295
01:18:12.251 --> 01:18:16.450
conversations, but to, oh, thank you for that Jack. I was on drugs.

1296
01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:20.230
That guy was, he was drunk. Yeah. Well that's, you know,

1297
01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:22.990
remember that's what Dolly said. Somebody said, Dolly, do you take drugs?

1298
01:18:22.991 --> 01:18:27.070
He said, I am drunk. Right? Another Spaniards. Spaniards are really something.

1299
01:18:27.250 --> 01:18:27.820
But that

1300
01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:30.520
<v 1>is very similar to psychedelic states.</v>

1301
01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:36.610
<v 2>Well, maybe some people have access to them all the time, right? In part, well,</v>

1302
01:18:36.611 --> 01:18:37.800
there's a, there's actually no

1303
01:18:38.170 --> 01:18:38.340
<v 1>duration.</v>

1304
01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:42.510
It sits above our sink out there from a guy who has a tumor in his pituitary or

1305
01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:45.390
is a nice pituitary gland. His, um,

1306
01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:51.750
uh, what is the one that, that the one that they think producers. DMT.

1307
01:18:52.590 --> 01:18:57.040
What the fuck is it called? Not The pituitary gland. Now.

1308
01:18:57.610 --> 01:18:59.050
Pineal pioneer. Thank you.

1309
01:18:59.230 --> 01:19:03.730
He has a tumor in his [inaudible] tumor in his pineal gland. And so he,

1310
01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:07.750
he accesses these states all the time. So this guy has,

1311
01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:11.170
it's 100% DMT inspired artwork. I mean, if you look at it,

1312
01:19:11.370 --> 01:19:15.370
that's like what you see when you do DMT trips. It's like, it's a version,

1313
01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:19.570
you know, and in his style of art. But you can see the,

1314
01:19:20.290 --> 01:19:23.500
you can see the signature of DMT. There it is. There's his artwork.

1315
01:19:23.650 --> 01:19:26.740
What is his name? Sean Thornton. Sean Thorton. Thank you Sean.

1316
01:19:26.770 --> 01:19:29.560
Thanks for the artwork. It's fucking awesome. And it sits in our kitchen.

1317
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:32.490
I'll take a picture of it later and put it online. But, um,

1318
01:19:32.530 --> 01:19:37.060
that's his stuff like that. Super DMT, like, oh, that's amazing. I mean,

1319
01:19:37.061 --> 01:19:41.790
that's a thing, a trip to mean type a experience at, you know,

1320
01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:44.320
like you could say like Alex Gray, uh,

1321
01:19:44.321 --> 01:19:46.870
is probably the most representative I would say.

1322
01:19:46.871 --> 01:19:49.780
He's the most representative in terms of artists in the,

1323
01:19:49.781 --> 01:19:51.920
the DMT space in terms of like, uh,

1324
01:19:51.970 --> 01:19:55.480
tryptamines and siliciden and things along those lines.

1325
01:19:56.380 --> 01:20:00.460
<v 2>And so if you think about, um,</v>

1326
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.520
psychoactive chemicals, some of them are stupefying,

1327
01:20:03.670 --> 01:20:06.190
but some of them are portals.

1328
01:20:06.930 --> 01:20:10.770
And this concept of if you look at a wall,

1329
01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:13.620
how do you know that the wall doesn't have a door?

1330
01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:16.800
How do you know that there isn't a panic room behind the bookcase if you've just

1331
01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:19.650
pull out the right book? We are,

1332
01:20:19.890 --> 01:20:24.570
we learned to stop looking for the portal. And I think what I,

1333
01:20:25.290 --> 01:20:30.090
what I do differently than other people is that I became obsessed with exits.

1334
01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:34.740
That there are other worlds and they're real, that this,

1335
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:36.810
this mythology of the looking glass.

1336
01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:41.900
And the rabbit hole and the Matrix is metaphor for very real things and that we

1337
01:20:43.561 --> 01:20:44.394
just,

1338
01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:49.290
we live our lives in the most ordinary mesoscale phenomenon where, you know,

1339
01:20:49.291 --> 01:20:51.510
we don't see, um,

1340
01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:54.690
we don't see the quantum because we're not, you know,

1341
01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:59.010
playing with polarized lenses in ways that show us what light actually is.

1342
01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:03.750
Um, you know, we're not playing with super fluid helium. We're not uh,

1343
01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:05.670
understanding, um,

1344
01:21:06.690 --> 01:21:09.810
just how bizarre olfaction is or you know,

1345
01:21:10.290 --> 01:21:14.730
whether there is some sort of quantum aspect of biology and what you see people

1346
01:21:14.731 --> 01:21:18.660
doing is that they're, they, they start grasping for everything.

1347
01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:23.340
Like I'm not saying that there's nothing to ancient aliens or UFOs or whatever,

1348
01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:28.400
but a lot of that is just people want something richer and more,

1349
01:21:28.590 --> 01:21:30.240
more amazing for their lives.

1350
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:33.960
And I'm not going to pass too much judgment on that,

1351
01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:37.760
but I am going to say if we just restricted the,

1352
01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:41.700
the rest of our days to the provable stuff that we know is out there,

1353
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:44.160
it could be amazing.

1354
01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:47.940
People need more meaning with all of the rationality,

1355
01:21:47.941 --> 01:21:50.100
with all of the mystery we've taken out of the world.

1356
01:21:50.130 --> 01:21:51.810
It's time to put a ton of it back in.

1357
01:21:54.930 --> 01:21:58.370
When you say put, put a ton of it back in like, hey,

1358
01:21:58.430 --> 01:22:02.640
how are you going to put it back in? Well, um, you know,

1359
01:22:02.641 --> 01:22:04.560
if I were to start talking about the October,

1360
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:08.670
Ian's an eight dimensional number system that no one understands,

1361
01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:11.550
I can do that totally rigorously.

1362
01:22:11.551 --> 01:22:14.700
I can show you all sorts of bizarre stuff involving the October eons.

1363
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:16.440
What is the October? Well, that's my point.

1364
01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:20.460
You don't even know that there are four types of numbers.

1365
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:22.980
Who's dance, uh,

1366
01:22:23.170 --> 01:22:26.280
called the real numbers that we know complex numbers that were tortured once

1367
01:22:26.281 --> 01:22:29.610
with in high school, maybe during some kind of a trip.

1368
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.880
A friend of you mentioned, the court mentioned the quaternions to you,

1369
01:22:33.330 --> 01:22:36.060
and then there's this one system of numbers, uh,

1370
01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:40.040
which is like the crazy relative nobody discusses and that's called the October

1371
01:22:40.350 --> 01:22:44.280
ones. And the October ones are so weird that mathematicians don't even really

1372
01:22:44.281 --> 01:22:48.360
understand why they're there. That's an octomom that thing. Well,

1373
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:52.500
my guess is that that's probably back to the root lattice of v Eight which we

1374
01:22:52.501 --> 01:22:57.270
discussed last time, which has this kind of Mandela pattern to it. But,

1375
01:22:58.260 --> 01:23:01.260
um, I could show you their multiplication table.

1376
01:23:01.261 --> 01:23:04.650
I could describe their cemeteries. There's a symmetry group called two,

1377
01:23:04.710 --> 01:23:09.010
which involves these strange numbers, but it's a mystery. Like if I got to,

1378
01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:13.030
I probably know more about the [inaudible] than most mathematicians.

1379
01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:16.270
If I got to the end of all of my knowledge of the Octoni eons,

1380
01:23:17.050 --> 01:23:20.350
I still wouldn't know what to tell you about why they're there and what they

1381
01:23:20.351 --> 01:23:23.020
mean. Nobody knows. I promise you that

1382
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.120
that's a real mystery. Now we could talk about like, you know,

1383
01:23:28.150 --> 01:23:31.510
my friend said that that event that happened in Siberia in the early, you know,

1384
01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:35.890
20th century was actually an alien visitation. Well, maybe best, maybe no,

1385
01:23:35.891 --> 01:23:36.790
I don't know anything about it.

1386
01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:43.020
If I just focused us on like what we know is out there that we don't grasp,

1387
01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:45.670
which is 100% rock solid,

1388
01:23:46.570 --> 01:23:50.980
it provides so much mystery and meaning and invitation to adventure. Like,

1389
01:23:50.981 --> 01:23:55.840
if you're looking for a hero's journey, I'll show you a ton of these things.

1390
01:23:55.900 --> 01:24:00.700
And it's empowering. It's just incredibly, um,

1391
01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:05.980
it's incredibly empowering to know that you're a hair's breath away from

1392
01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:10.120
superpowers. So I want to help people explore that. Oh,

1393
01:24:10.121 --> 01:24:13.210
so what is that like when you're explaining this,

1394
01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:17.560
when you're saying this is bizarre series of numbers, right? What is it doing?

1395
01:24:17.561 --> 01:24:22.120
Like what, how, how do we interface with it? Well, um,

1396
01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:24.040
so for example, let's,

1397
01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:27.070
let's take an easier system that we feel a little bit more confident with.

1398
01:24:27.071 --> 01:24:31.810
There's this thing called the quaternions, which are based on the number one,

1399
01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:35.080
the complex number. I,

1400
01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:38.380
if you remember that from some distant math class,

1401
01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:40.690
and then there's something called j and k.

1402
01:24:41.170 --> 01:24:46.170
So I Times j equals k j times cake was I j times I is equal to the negative of I

1403
01:24:48.101 --> 01:24:52.990
times j. So negative k, there's a multiplication table for these,

1404
01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:54.040
these objects.

1405
01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:59.470
And these objects help with computer vision. You know,

1406
01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:03.070
computers, uh, simulation 3d, uh, projections,

1407
01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:07.180
they're used all the time in, um, probably video games.

1408
01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:09.760
They may come up in nature. I mean,

1409
01:25:09.761 --> 01:25:13.240
we know that nature uses complex numbers and most people never found out why

1410
01:25:13.241 --> 01:25:16.360
they were being told about complex numbers or imaginary numbers because they

1411
01:25:16.361 --> 01:25:20.410
never got to the point where you're actually looking at wave functions that

1412
01:25:21.010 --> 01:25:25.600
described photons and electrons and all of all of that good stuff that you read

1413
01:25:25.601 --> 01:25:29.350
about in physics. So in essence, um,

1414
01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:32.020
the Octoni eons are a system where I,

1415
01:25:32.021 --> 01:25:35.560
j k keeps going effectively through element on PQR, you know,

1416
01:25:35.561 --> 01:25:39.640
till you've got eight different objects and they're not even associative,

1417
01:25:39.970 --> 01:25:42.120
which is one of these rules that you learned about, like, you know,

1418
01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:46.000
multiplication as associative and you think, well, what is an associative,

1419
01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:49.630
right? So if I, you know, if you, if you talk about community, for example,

1420
01:25:50.110 --> 01:25:52.520
I can't tell whether you put on your shirt, uh,

1421
01:25:52.630 --> 01:25:54.330
first or your shoes first because it's,

1422
01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:56.380
it's communitive as to which order you did it.

1423
01:25:56.381 --> 01:25:58.570
But if you put on your underwear in a different order than you put on your

1424
01:25:58.571 --> 01:26:02.830
pants, that'll become immediately obvious which order you did it. Right. Okay.

1425
01:26:02.831 --> 01:26:03.170
Well,

1426
01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:06.950
there's another thing called associativity and almost everything that we deal

1427
01:26:06.951 --> 01:26:10.040
with in elementary mathematics is associative. So you're like,

1428
01:26:10.041 --> 01:26:11.270
why do I learn about associativity?

1429
01:26:11.271 --> 01:26:14.050
I've never met anything that isn't associated. Well, the OCTONI and associates,

1430
01:26:14.450 --> 01:26:19.450
they're a number system that is responsible for most of the Plat,

1431
01:26:20.421 --> 01:26:23.150
a pie of mathematics, if you will, things that just occur.

1432
01:26:23.810 --> 01:26:28.810
Anomalously so that's an example of an invitation out of this planet.

1433
01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:31.790
You know,

1434
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:34.820
if you start to think about the Octoni ans and care about them and say,

1435
01:26:34.850 --> 01:26:38.590
are they a message? Do they have meaning? We can prove that they're there,

1436
01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:39.860
construct them for you,

1437
01:26:40.610 --> 01:26:45.050
but they generate so much bizarreness in some sort of abstract space.

1438
01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:47.330
How are they recognized? Like how, how was it,

1439
01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:49.960
how did it come to be that this was a point of discussion? Well, there's,

1440
01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:51.620
there's a process. In fact,

1441
01:26:51.621 --> 01:26:55.190
there are two processes where you can build these number systems up from each

1442
01:26:55.191 --> 01:26:57.950
other. So you build the complex from the real,

1443
01:26:57.980 --> 01:27:00.200
you build the quaternions from the complex,

1444
01:27:00.201 --> 01:27:03.650
you build the October Ian's from the quaternions and then you can't build

1445
01:27:03.651 --> 01:27:08.651
anything beyond that because each time you're giving up a magical power to get

1446
01:27:09.201 --> 01:27:09.981
to the next stage.

1447
01:27:09.981 --> 01:27:13.390
And by the time you get to the Octoni and you're exhausted the system giving

1448
01:27:13.490 --> 01:27:16.230
them a magical power. Well like for example, um,

1449
01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:19.070
it's very hard to think about the square root of negative one.

1450
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:22.550
So like what does it mean for something squared to be negative?

1451
01:27:23.330 --> 01:27:27.020
So that's like the complex numbers gave up, that kind of sensibility.

1452
01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:31.550
And then the complex numbers, or at least community a times B equals B times a,

1453
01:27:31.551 --> 01:27:33.950
but the quaternions don't have that price property.

1454
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:36.740
So then you have a further property called associativity.

1455
01:27:36.741 --> 01:27:39.290
So you're sort of to eat, to build the next system.

1456
01:27:39.410 --> 01:27:42.380
You're giving up properties that sort of make sense to us.

1457
01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:45.290
And by the time you've gotten to the act, Tony, you've given everything away.

1458
01:27:45.291 --> 01:27:49.220
There's no way you're going to build the next system. But yet it's real. Yes.

1459
01:27:49.221 --> 01:27:52.880
Yet it's real in a, in a, in a, in a very real mathematical sense.

1460
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:55.910
So does it just highlight our lack of understanding? Yeah.

1461
01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.710
And it is a call to adventure.

1462
01:27:57.711 --> 01:28:00.230
It's like a message from something that isn't human.

1463
01:28:00.830 --> 01:28:02.060
I'm not going to say that it's God.

1464
01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:05.720
I'm not going to say that it's logic or design, but it's a more complex,

1465
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:07.670
it's something to them of the universe. That's right.

1466
01:28:07.671 --> 01:28:12.140
And you have to uncover that these things are there. Or for example, you know,

1467
01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:15.650
see elegance. I don't know if you've like played with the,

1468
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:19.370
do you know about c elegans? No. Alright. CLEC elegance.

1469
01:28:19.371 --> 01:28:23.570
C letter elegance. And again,

1470
01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:25.940
elegans. I think it's okay.

1471
01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:29.840
So it's this worm that was chosen by this guy, Sydney Brenner,

1472
01:28:29.841 --> 01:28:33.470
who just died and it's a shame because he would've been a great podcast guest,

1473
01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:36.800
just like one of the most brilliant biologists that we didn't focus on.

1474
01:28:37.370 --> 01:28:38.300
And he said, you know what?

1475
01:28:38.301 --> 01:28:43.301
We're missing a species that we can completely describe soup to nuts.

1476
01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:48.410
Here's the one that's about the simplest thing with the brain.

1477
01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:53.560
It's only got a thousand cells and 300 of those cells make up a very primitive

1478
01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:58.900
neuro system and we're going to track where every goddamn cell like bring up

1479
01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:02.520
Jamie, if I could ask you, so to bring up the cell

1480
01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:05.220
<v 0>lineage diagram for sea elegans.</v>

1481
01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:11.190
So this will be the first of two images. Wow.

1482
01:29:12.210 --> 01:29:17.210
That is a complete map of how one fertilized egg becomes

1483
01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:23.510
a tiny microscopic worm for every possible division.

1484
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:26.740
What the fuck am I looking at?

1485
01:29:27.980 --> 01:29:32.570
I love when you say that, that is so wild right now.

1486
01:29:32.571 --> 01:29:33.404
Here's the thing.

1487
01:29:34.100 --> 01:29:39.100
Everyone in biology knows how cool this thing is and very few people,

1488
01:29:40.370 --> 01:29:45.370
not enough people outside of biology know that we have completely mapped how one

1489
01:29:46.641 --> 01:29:49.820
cell, like if you're 30 trillion cells around,

1490
01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:52.400
it's too big to write a diagram.

1491
01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:55.220
It's only possible because there are only a thousand cells and this thing has

1492
01:29:55.221 --> 01:29:59.240
locomotion. It has sexual reproduction, you know it eats.

1493
01:29:59.870 --> 01:30:04.870
So you're looking at the architectural plans for an actual organism and Jamie,

1494
01:30:07.131 --> 01:30:08.060
when we're done with that,

1495
01:30:08.330 --> 01:30:13.330
if I could trouble you for the look for the folks that are just falling,

1496
01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:14.690
kind of pause free for a moment.

1497
01:30:14.690 --> 01:30:17.120
For the folks that are falling at home listening, just listening,

1498
01:30:17.121 --> 01:30:19.760
not watching what we're looking at. Jamie,

1499
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:22.850
explain how someone could see this image if they want to go with themselves.

1500
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:23.930
The letter C,

1501
01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:28.070
it's not the not see like the ocean to see elegance and then that cell lineage,

1502
01:30:28.071 --> 01:30:32.840
it looks like a really long basketball bracket. Yes. Pushed out forever.

1503
01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:36.950
That's a good way to describe it. Yeah, it's fucking wild.

1504
01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:40.190
Yeah. Talk about March madness

1505
01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:47.210
madness, June men February. It just doesn't stop.

1506
01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:50.360
If we could bring up the um,

1507
01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:54.800
wiring diagram or adjacency matrix. Yeah,

1508
01:30:54.801 --> 01:30:57.200
let's see how it gets wired oriented. All right. Yeah. Perfect.

1509
01:30:58.310 --> 01:31:03.310
That is a complete map of the 300 neurons in the sea elegans worm.

1510
01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:10.790
How they are wired to each other. Like that is a map of the mind of the worm.

1511
01:31:11.930 --> 01:31:15.500
Wow. Okay. So that's the portal.

1512
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.970
That's another portal.

1513
01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:22.600
Here's an organism which is completely mapped and has complex behaviors.

1514
01:31:22.940 --> 01:31:27.020
It has, I think about half the number of adult cell types that you and I have,

1515
01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:32.180
so maybe we have like 250 had like only 250 different kinds of adult cells,

1516
01:31:32.181 --> 01:31:34.670
more or less. I don't want to get too precise about that

1517
01:31:36.170 --> 01:31:41.170
and yet we are like 10 trillion or 30 trillion copies of those tiny number of

1518
01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:43.250
different types of cells.

1519
01:31:43.410 --> 01:31:47.090
Whether I think the sea elegans has about 125 or something like that,

1520
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:51.320
different cell types and it only has a thousand cells and it's able to do most

1521
01:31:51.321 --> 01:31:55.720
of what we're able to do. We move around, we eat,

1522
01:31:55.750 --> 01:32:00.070
we have sex, right? Pretty simple life. Do you think

1523
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:04.090
<v 2>it's ever possible? Well, let's, I'm sure it's probably possible,</v>

1524
01:32:04.091 --> 01:32:07.120
but do you think in our lifetime we'll ever see a map like that of a human

1525
01:32:07.121 --> 01:32:08.440
organism? I don't think so,

1526
01:32:08.441 --> 01:32:11.380
but the cool thing is we have this map and we still don't understand it.

1527
01:32:11.381 --> 01:32:14.950
Like we've got this thing dead to rights. We've got it boxed in. It can't.

1528
01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:17.320
We know every single cell, what it does,

1529
01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:22.330
we have all the wirings between the neurons and we still don't get it.

1530
01:32:23.410 --> 01:32:27.220
Right, right. So like imagine that your, what,

1531
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:31.300
eight years that, well, what did, what did genius,

1532
01:32:31.301 --> 01:32:35.230
this Guy Sydney Brenner was for choosing this organism [inaudible] right.

1533
01:32:36.220 --> 01:32:41.220
Because this organism is the simplest place to look at complex life.

1534
01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:48.340
[inaudible] this image of the reconstructed biological neural networks.

1535
01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:52.130
Like you're looking, okay,

1536
01:32:53.410 --> 01:32:58.410
now we could have a discussion about some weird Peruvian structure and whether

1537
01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:02.050
we'd been visited [inaudible] and I'd be up for that. Look,

1538
01:33:02.850 --> 01:33:07.240
I to pretend that I'm too good for it, but I know that this is real.

1539
01:33:07.870 --> 01:33:10.780
I don't have any doubt. I'm not going to sit around asking, well,

1540
01:33:10.781 --> 01:33:11.950
do you believe that, you know,

1541
01:33:12.130 --> 01:33:15.530
aliens talk to this federal government in the forties, right. Um,

1542
01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:20.550
that might as well be an alien. Yeah. And it's an invitation to adventure. Yeah.

1543
01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:25.540
And we are destroying. I mean, you know, getting,

1544
01:33:25.570 --> 01:33:26.650
just getting back to it,

1545
01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:29.830
the reason that I'm fighting through culture war issues,

1546
01:33:29.831 --> 01:33:31.690
which are not very interesting to me,

1547
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:36.580
is that we are destroying the thing that has the ability to make sense of the

1548
01:33:36.581 --> 01:33:41.290
world. Right? It's really designed in logic. What I mean,

1549
01:33:41.291 --> 01:33:45.790
like the ability to say no. You know, you come with an experiment that failed,

1550
01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:50.740
you know, and you say, I think it succeeded. I say, no it didn't. It failed.

1551
01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:51.550
And you say, well,

1552
01:33:51.550 --> 01:33:56.550
I actually am a Cambodian and I think you're discriminating against me because

1553
01:33:57.551 --> 01:34:01.510
I'm Cambodian. It's like, look, your experiment failed.

1554
01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:04.900
It has nothing to do with Cambodian, you know,

1555
01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:10.270
and you keep that stuff out of my lap. I mean,

1556
01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:11.830
if you want your war stuff, yeah.

1557
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:17.310
Really what I'm animated by is get your fucking social engineering out of my

1558
01:34:17.921 --> 01:34:21.460
laboratory. You've got 10 minutes and I'm calling security. That's my issue.

1559
01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:26.700
It's not telling people how to behave or that I have all the answers or that we

1560
01:34:27.311 --> 01:34:30.490
need to be objective in our lives and we just want to have sensible discussions.

1561
01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:31.353
It's,

1562
01:34:31.870 --> 01:34:36.400
you're coming after core reality and our ability to make sense of the world.

1563
01:34:36.430 --> 01:34:39.400
And so I'm happy to entertain all sorts of things.

1564
01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:44.200
You take one foot step, one foot in my lab and I'm calling security.

1565
01:34:44.201 --> 01:34:45.250
And if I can't do that,

1566
01:34:45.490 --> 01:34:50.490
if I can't maintain a scientific journal or a university in which the bullshit

1567
01:34:50.861 --> 01:34:52.780
departments do not invade,

1568
01:34:52.781 --> 01:34:56.950
the departments that are actually doing the super important work were lost.

1569
01:34:57.170 --> 01:34:58.580
And there is a distinction

1570
01:34:58.900 --> 01:35:00.860
<v 4>and I mean, this distinction needs to be made there.</v>

1571
01:35:00.861 --> 01:35:04.430
There is a distinction between hard science and gender studies.

1572
01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:07.190
If you could put, pull up Jamie. Um,

1573
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:13.280
let's do the, uh, anomalous magnetic moment of the electron.

1574
01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:21.290
Oh, you can do, yeah. You went all Sean Connery on me. One raise the eyebrow.

1575
01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:23.540
Yeah. One eyebrow. Isn't that like a genetic thing?

1576
01:35:23.541 --> 01:35:26.620
Like you can curl your tongue like, hey, I could do that.

1577
01:35:26.690 --> 01:35:29.330
Some people can't do that at [inaudible]. [inaudible]

1578
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:34.520
what do you mean turned upside down? Oh No, I can't do that. All right.

1579
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:39.150
You've got one thing. I got another. Okay. This is a very mature Joe. Huh?

1580
01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:47.360
Um, what, what is it going on here? Um, put a Sig,

1581
01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:52.070
I'm looking for a number with like 10 or 11 significant digits.

1582
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:55.303
Um,

1583
01:35:55.870 --> 01:36:00.710
we are able to do calculations in quantum electrodynamics let's say a quantum

1584
01:36:00.711 --> 01:36:05.711
field theory in which we can figure out the precision of some thing.

1585
01:36:06.651 --> 01:36:11.651
We can predict it to like 10 or 11 decimal places of accuracy.

1586
01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:14.600
And when I look at the,

1587
01:36:15.250 --> 01:36:19.580
the achievement that was necessary to have theory agree with experiment to that

1588
01:36:19.581 --> 01:36:20.414
level.

1589
01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:26.080
And then I listened to some of the discussions about, oh,

1590
01:36:26.090 --> 01:36:28.610
just take these hoaxes about, you know, uh,

1591
01:36:28.730 --> 01:36:31.540
somebody who submitted parts of mine comp to a, you know,

1592
01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:34.960
as with Jews re written as men, Peter, but right.

1593
01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:40.280
Those two subjects are taking place in the same institution.

1594
01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:45.110
One is incredibly rigorous and demanding and completely unforgiving.

1595
01:36:45.111 --> 01:36:48.830
And the other thing is just like prevalence and nonsense. Well,

1596
01:36:48.890 --> 01:36:51.380
maybe there's a core of it that makes sense, but there's,

1597
01:36:51.410 --> 01:36:55.040
it's not going to get anywhere close to the achievements of the,

1598
01:36:55.041 --> 01:36:59.030
of the hard sciences. But the core of it, whether or not it makes sense,

1599
01:36:59.050 --> 01:37:02.270
the real problem is the motivation for doing it in the first place. Well,

1600
01:37:02.271 --> 01:37:05.960
the real motivation may be activism,

1601
01:37:06.110 --> 01:37:09.950
but Activision activism and scholarship aren't,

1602
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:13.100
I mean there's so many things that I want to be true that just aren't,

1603
01:37:14.450 --> 01:37:18.710
I want beautiful. I mean like you know, nature, you spend time in nature,

1604
01:37:19.490 --> 01:37:20.570
you want to think, you know,

1605
01:37:20.571 --> 01:37:24.440
like nature's a community and where the forest is a bunch of different organisms

1606
01:37:24.441 --> 01:37:27.080
all working together. No, it's red of tooth and claw.

1607
01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:32.390
Everything that you think about the universe that is purely beautiful and

1608
01:37:32.391 --> 01:37:35.240
aspirational is contradicted by some system in nature.

1609
01:37:36.290 --> 01:37:40.880
And that's why evolutionary theory was the first thing on the chopping block.

1610
01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:42.321
It's just like, well,

1611
01:37:42.321 --> 01:37:46.430
this contradicts everything we want to claim about organisms. Well, tough luck.

1612
01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:50.360
I feel like there's a way to define this clearly that makes people understand it

1613
01:37:50.361 --> 01:37:54.980
better. Okay. And I don't, I don't know if I'm the guy to do it, but I feel like

1614
01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:01.140
<v 3>there's a, this is an incredibly complex issue,</v>

1615
01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:01.890
right?

1616
01:38:01.890 --> 01:38:06.890
Where you're dealing with emotions and feelings and people who feel like there's

1617
01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:10.860
unjustice in the world and inequality and they focus on those things to the

1618
01:38:10.861 --> 01:38:15.861
point where they're almost participating in social engineering by ignoring

1619
01:38:17.191 --> 01:38:22.191
reality and focusing on what they want to be true in sort of this way of

1620
01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:27.870
reimagining the world and they are also demanding compliance.

1621
01:38:27.871 --> 01:38:30.150
This is a big part of this whole thing that's going on here.

1622
01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:31.710
Then on the other hand,

1623
01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:37.550
you've got this stuff yet these hard sciences that demand just regular,

1624
01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:40.170
rigorous intellectual debate.

1625
01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:44.460
They demand careful study of the facts. They demand

1626
01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:50.610
deep understanding of complex mathematics in order to achieve these results and

1627
01:38:50.611 --> 01:38:54.480
to be able to verify them. They're unforgiving, unforgiving. There's just,

1628
01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:58.470
they're two totally different things and then what you're saying is when one of

1629
01:38:58.471 --> 01:39:02.370
them that is this sort of for frivolous,

1630
01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:03.480
airy,

1631
01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:08.840
kind of Utopian version of what they liked the future to be and then interferes,

1632
01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:16.100
right, where they want a certain amount of diverse people on the staff and

1633
01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:20.180
<v 2>not even saying that it's frivolous. I'm not even saying it's not scholarship.</v>

1634
01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:25.020
I'm saying that whatever it is, I don't care. Maybe,

1635
01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:27.770
maybe it's maybe it's some beautiful social thing.

1636
01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:29.680
<v 3>What do you do? But then they'll hit you with,</v>

1637
01:39:29.681 --> 01:39:33.430
you don't care because you're a white male and you have white male privilege

1638
01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:38.140
<v 2>and I don't. And what I realize is is that as important in as inclusion is,</v>

1639
01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:42.640
exclusion is equally important. And the instant you say that, I don't know you,

1640
01:39:42.641 --> 01:39:45.920
the time of day, what does that mean by exclusion? Equally important,

1641
01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:50.350
we keep talking about diversity and inclusion, diversity, inclusion, diversity,

1642
01:39:50.351 --> 01:39:53.080
inclusion. And there's an implicit threat in that,

1643
01:39:53.081 --> 01:39:57.250
which is what makes it really juicy and interesting, which is like, well,

1644
01:39:57.730 --> 01:40:01.510
let's look at us. We've got three white guys in here, this, Jamie, you and me.

1645
01:40:01.850 --> 01:40:06.510
So speak to yourself. I'm 1.6% African. Recognize that I knew he was good.

1646
01:40:06.610 --> 01:40:11.560
I knew he was going to play that card, but you sir can pass as white, right?

1647
01:40:12.050 --> 01:40:12.883
Yes. Okay.

1648
01:40:13.510 --> 01:40:17.380
Now in order to have the objection,

1649
01:40:17.770 --> 01:40:20.680
like there's some little bit of guilt, which is like, well,

1650
01:40:20.681 --> 01:40:23.630
why aren't there any people from Cambodia in here? Is that that we are,

1651
01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:28.540
we're really anti Cambodian. Um, if you carry that guilt,

1652
01:40:29.050 --> 01:40:32.080
you're always worried that you have to be able to prove that you're inclusive.

1653
01:40:32.110 --> 01:40:34.240
It doesn't matter. Right? Right. Okay.

1654
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:39.130
It is also important to exclude certain voices from the conversation.

1655
01:40:39.580 --> 01:40:43.240
So the voice that plays the card, which says, well,

1656
01:40:43.241 --> 01:40:47.260
you're only saying that because x, I don't have to listen to that voice.

1657
01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:48.790
And I think this is really important.

1658
01:40:49.870 --> 01:40:54.490
That is not a voice that needs to be answered. It's not a voice

1659
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:56.340
<v 0>that, um,</v>

1660
01:40:56.890 --> 01:41:01.540
needs to be taken seriously or paid attention to unless there's some serious

1661
01:41:01.541 --> 01:41:05.590
allegation that there has been some kind of discrimination or inclusion.

1662
01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:10.030
The burden of proof is on you for saying why that's interesting.

1663
01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:11.320
And a particular conversation.

1664
01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:19.450
The burden is on you to explain why that's interesting. Right.

1665
01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:24.850
Well, for them, they're trying to engineer a more fair and balanced society.

1666
01:41:24.851 --> 01:41:26.380
If I was gonna take their perspective,

1667
01:41:26.530 --> 01:41:30.820
they would say that the reason why there aren't more women in science or Trans

1668
01:41:30.821 --> 01:41:32.630
People in science or you know, fill,

1669
01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:36.010
and I'm also trying to engineer a world where there are more women in science.

1670
01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:37.150
How are you doing that?

1671
01:41:37.450 --> 01:41:42.430
By trying to figure out what is it that selecting against women, for example,

1672
01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:45.700
that we need to get women more money, as I said,

1673
01:41:45.701 --> 01:41:50.701
on this program earlier in their lives so they can hire help to help raise their

1674
01:41:50.981 --> 01:41:55.810
children so they can spend more time on their careers and balance. Um,

1675
01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:59.350
yeah, but a lot of women don't find that attractive. They don't want to do that.

1676
01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:03.010
Maybe. But I'm trying to think. But my point is,

1677
01:42:03.011 --> 01:42:07.430
is that there are lots of reasons that men and women are different, right? Yeah.

1678
01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:09.100
So for example, um,

1679
01:42:09.130 --> 01:42:14.130
I saw a beautiful video of a guy who jumps down an enormous flight of stairs on

1680
01:42:14.411 --> 01:42:18.280
a skateboard and he just nails the landing and it's just a, it's a thing of art.

1681
01:42:19.390 --> 01:42:24.390
And then it shows you 150 attempts where this guy just abused his body.

1682
01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:30.640
And failed and failed, maybe broke a tooth, you know,

1683
01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:33.010
blood everywhere and you're thinking,

1684
01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:38.220
oh you showed me the success and you didn't show me that this guy was willing to

1685
01:42:38.681 --> 01:42:42.820
put his brain, his life on the line in order to nail that trick.

1686
01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:47.140
And he's actually one of the world's falling champions. Right? Okay.

1687
01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:49.300
Well when you start saying, well,

1688
01:42:49.330 --> 01:42:53.140
why are you putting this video of this person who's doing this thing, you know,

1689
01:42:53.230 --> 01:42:56.260
on the Internet because that person belongs to a privileged class. I'm saying,

1690
01:42:56.261 --> 01:43:01.261
well I don't know that guy abused himself and put himself at risk and you know,

1691
01:43:02.201 --> 01:43:05.710
devoted his life in a singular way that no sensible PR. I mean I would be,

1692
01:43:06.370 --> 01:43:10.760
I would be appalled if my son did that. I'd be furious with it. No,

1693
01:43:10.810 --> 01:43:12.010
there are things that are,

1694
01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:16.450
that are happening that result in imbalances that aren't about some kind of

1695
01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:17.501
unfairness.

1696
01:43:17.501 --> 01:43:20.830
And I think it's very important to say that unfairness is real and structural

1697
01:43:20.831 --> 01:43:25.831
problems are real and non structural problems and things that really aren't

1698
01:43:27.041 --> 01:43:28.330
unfair are also real.

1699
01:43:28.331 --> 01:43:32.980
I think we both agree that it's important for people to have the opportunity to

1700
01:43:32.981 --> 01:43:35.050
pursue what they enjoy pursuing.

1701
01:43:35.110 --> 01:43:40.110
I think there's also an issue where we want people to be more represented.

1702
01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:44.440
We want more of that,

1703
01:43:44.441 --> 01:43:48.250
that kind of person that's interested in something when they might not

1704
01:43:48.251 --> 01:43:52.280
necessarily naturally gravitate towards it. And it not be

1705
01:43:52.570 --> 01:43:56.060
<v 3>that there are some impediments and that there's some boundaries and some,</v>

1706
01:43:56.061 --> 01:44:00.680
some sort of a boys club that keeps them out and it might be more that they're

1707
01:44:00.681 --> 01:44:02.430
just not that interested in that.

1708
01:44:03.050 --> 01:44:07.430
They're all sorts of biologically that's been proven in studies that I'm trying

1709
01:44:07.431 --> 01:44:10.330
to make it a different point. Right. Okay. To me, what I'm

1710
01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:14.230
<v 4>trying to say is, I made a mistake years ago,</v>

1711
01:44:14.590 --> 01:44:18.400
I think of engaging in answering this point, which is,

1712
01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:22.060
you know, let's say let's take piano competitions.

1713
01:44:22.061 --> 01:44:26.800
Why are piano competitions historically a disproportionately, you know,

1714
01:44:27.230 --> 01:44:30.950
uh, let's say entered in one by Russians or chess or who knows what? Well,

1715
01:44:31.210 --> 01:44:35.980
Russians are beasts in the way that they destroy children on their way to the

1716
01:44:35.981 --> 01:44:36.940
concert stage.

1717
01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:41.890
They will do things that most American families will not do to produce a concert

1718
01:44:41.891 --> 01:44:46.540
pianist. Okay. That's not an unfairness for the rest of us. I mean,

1719
01:44:46.541 --> 01:44:47.440
I play the piano.

1720
01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:52.270
I can't get on stage with these guys because they're just amazing. It's not,

1721
01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:56.500
it's not an unfairness that I'm not represented on that stage.

1722
01:44:57.600 --> 01:44:59.800
Um, you know, if I told you that I'm,

1723
01:44:59.830 --> 01:45:02.450
my intention is to become the world's greatest, uh,

1724
01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:07.420
Jujitsu expert at age 53. Being overweight and not having, uh,

1725
01:45:07.450 --> 01:45:10.060
any history in combat sports. You know,

1726
01:45:10.061 --> 01:45:13.540
and I know that it's not going to happen with the right amount of drugs.

1727
01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:16.593
Come on, Joe

1728
01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:19.780
<v 3>and engineering. We can do miraculous things. That's true.</v>

1729
01:45:19.810 --> 01:45:24.520
We can make him better than he was. Yeah. We need 'em daily stem cells.

1730
01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:26.380
We're gonna, we're going to have to do some real,

1731
01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:29.050
cause we're gonna take a chance on cancer and all sorts of other diseases.

1732
01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:31.570
We can, we can achieve some things. Okay.

1733
01:45:31.571 --> 01:45:35.710
But the previous conversation that we're going, no, you need to develop.

1734
01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:38.950
You need to develop it. It needs to be a part of your, well,

1735
01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:42.010
here's the thing that I always say about a striking sports.

1736
01:45:42.250 --> 01:45:46.930
Striking sports are probably one of the more interesting ones in that when you

1737
01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:49.030
start out at an early age,

1738
01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:54.120
your body develops learning how to strike and it's a gigantic advantage over

1739
01:45:54.521 --> 01:45:57.640
someone who learns once they're past puberty.

1740
01:45:58.210 --> 01:46:01.960
When you get someone who's learning how to strike and they're in their twenties

1741
01:46:01.961 --> 01:46:06.520
it takes a real outlier to become super successful. It's very,

1742
01:46:06.521 --> 01:46:07.740
very rare. But I remember

1743
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:12.920
<v 4>being in a fist fight and throwing a punch and not connecting and hurting my</v>

1744
01:46:12.921 --> 01:46:17.690
arm. It was like, oh, I didn't understand if you, it's not free.

1745
01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:20.480
You know, it's like a very, it's a very expensive. Now all you've got,

1746
01:46:20.481 --> 01:46:23.630
this is your left arm and you got a really pissed off person, a across from you.

1747
01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:24.800
Um,

1748
01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:29.800
what I was getting back to is I wanted to talk about in part the portal and how

1749
01:46:31.851 --> 01:46:35.210
it relates to the whole sort of weird social justice thing.

1750
01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:40.640
The key point is, I'm not that interested in the culture wars.

1751
01:46:41.060 --> 01:46:46.060
I'm interested in the pipeline of amazing stuff that is unforgiving.

1752
01:46:46.670 --> 01:46:50.010
<v 3>Right? But don't you think that along the way you have to kind of address it?</v>

1753
01:46:50.011 --> 01:46:53.610
The culture wars are a thing. Try to figure out why they're a thing.

1754
01:46:53.850 --> 01:46:55.140
Trying to figure out what,

1755
01:46:55.290 --> 01:47:00.290
what are the main points and main factors that are responsible for it being a

1756
01:47:00.661 --> 01:47:01.410
thing?

1757
01:47:01.410 --> 01:47:06.360
And is there a way to mitigate its impact on progress? Well, this is,

1758
01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:08.870
I'm concerned that the culture wars are going to be

1759
01:47:08.910 --> 01:47:13.530
<v 4>keep girls, black people, whoever,</v>

1760
01:47:13.531 --> 01:47:17.670
short people. I don't know what out of the things that they want to do. Why?

1761
01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:20.370
Because we're not being honest about what it actually,

1762
01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:23.640
what is involved in selecting against people.

1763
01:47:23.641 --> 01:47:27.510
So you brought up the issue of interests. So like the Google memo,

1764
01:47:27.780 --> 01:47:31.880
the James Demora issue, right. For Exit, a great example publicly. Okay.

1765
01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:36.000
But my wife went on Dave Ruben show and she, you know, sh look,

1766
01:47:36.001 --> 01:47:41.001
this is a woman who brought a techniques of gage field theory into economics.

1767
01:47:42.690 --> 01:47:46.230
So she's, she's no slouch when it comes to analytic thinking.

1768
01:47:46.231 --> 01:47:50.910
She's in niche field three, similar to gauge symmetry at gauge theory. Okay.

1769
01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:54.150
Just call it gates theory. And she wasn't, she wasn't doing,

1770
01:47:54.420 --> 01:47:59.340
she wasn't doing quantum theory, but she was taking, she, she, her thesis,

1771
01:48:00.690 --> 01:48:01.523
um,

1772
01:48:02.970 --> 01:48:06.210
brought techniques of bundle theory,

1773
01:48:06.211 --> 01:48:10.410
like the hop vibration that we had and showed that economics without any

1774
01:48:10.411 --> 01:48:15.411
alteration was a mature geometric system in engaged theoretical thing.

1775
01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:20.160
Um,

1776
01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:25.140
so it didn't s we collaborated on on showing that,

1777
01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:29.040
uh, you can't accommodate changing preferences, uh,

1778
01:48:29.041 --> 01:48:32.040
in economics without gauge theory.

1779
01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:36.780
So that was kind of pretty amazing. It was really great, great fun. The,

1780
01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:39.330
she, her point was,

1781
01:48:39.690 --> 01:48:44.690
I didn't enjoy the unpleasantness of,

1782
01:48:45.630 --> 01:48:48.930
um, focusing on these things because they were so abstract.

1783
01:48:49.380 --> 01:48:52.830
And so I wanted, you know, I was interested in people,

1784
01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:58.520
I was interested in making sure that our models could capture human dynamics

1785
01:48:59.131 --> 01:49:03.080
better. And you know, I was just really excited by the,

1786
01:49:03.081 --> 01:49:05.670
the collaboration we were doing, which is, you know,

1787
01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:09.900
she and I came from two different worlds and we found this bridge between them.

1788
01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:14.790
Um, so she went in, Dave Ruben and said, look, it's not about abilities.

1789
01:49:14.850 --> 01:49:17.280
Women are as smart as men. It's interests.

1790
01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:19.990
We're not interested in the same things necessarily. Right.

1791
01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:23.940
And that should be okay. But when she said it on Dave Ruben show,

1792
01:49:23.941 --> 01:49:28.941
it didn't register anywhere than date than James Demore set it and like the

1793
01:49:29.341 --> 01:49:31.610
world freaks, how dare you. But that's

1794
01:49:31.610 --> 01:49:34.040
<v 3>also because he said it within the environment of Google.</v>

1795
01:49:34.041 --> 01:49:36.050
He just wasn't on the podcast if he had just said.

1796
01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:40.280
But if he had said that same exact thing and he was an employee of Google and he

1797
01:49:40.281 --> 01:49:42.770
was on a podcast, even if it was a popular podcast,

1798
01:49:43.190 --> 01:49:46.070
I don't think it would have created as honestly as much of an issue that drew me

1799
01:49:46.130 --> 01:49:48.100
in. It was the fact that it's, and the fact that you can

1800
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:49.990
<v 4>get paid for these, you know,</v>

1801
01:49:50.410 --> 01:49:54.760
these weird sort of spectrum e skills, which, you know, guilty.

1802
01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:55.990
That's what I care about.

1803
01:49:55.991 --> 01:50:00.991
I really enjoy doing isolated things in the absence of other people that have a

1804
01:50:01.151 --> 01:50:04.630
very technical nature to them. And you know,

1805
01:50:04.631 --> 01:50:09.230
my experience in general is that, uh, I, you know,

1806
01:50:09.231 --> 01:50:12.850
I've had female collaborators in very technical subjects.

1807
01:50:13.450 --> 01:50:18.450
Fewer women are interested in things that re involve isolation and technical

1808
01:50:21.941 --> 01:50:24.070
things removed from human interaction.

1809
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:29.550
And so that statement will undoubtedly cause a flurry of activity.

1810
01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:34.180
And if a, if a person says it,

1811
01:50:34.230 --> 01:50:37.720
who is not suspected of trying to keep women out of something. Like,

1812
01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:42.400
my point is I want a much more equal world,

1813
01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:47.410
but we have a very different diagnosis as to why the world is as unequal as it

1814
01:50:47.411 --> 01:50:48.244
is.

1815
01:50:48.430 --> 01:50:52.810
And your diagnosis is that it's unequal because people have varied interests and

1816
01:50:52.811 --> 01:50:55.630
that, but also like something as dumb as kin work.

1817
01:50:56.290 --> 01:51:00.160
When can work women take care of sick relatives,

1818
01:51:00.190 --> 01:51:04.450
children and the elderly at a level that most men can't be bothered with.

1819
01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:07.450
You know, it's just like, Eh, I don't care. So you know,

1820
01:51:07.451 --> 01:51:12.451
you've got all of these guys hyperfocused on their career who are doing the

1821
01:51:12.970 --> 01:51:16.690
equivalent of jumping down a flight of stairs on a skateboard. You know,

1822
01:51:16.691 --> 01:51:19.110
maybe it's not healthy. And then you've got an a,

1823
01:51:19.130 --> 01:51:21.130
another group of people who are, it's like saying, you know,

1824
01:51:21.370 --> 01:51:22.570
I want to have children,

1825
01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:25.570
I want to stay home with the kids for a couple of years because it's really

1826
01:51:25.571 --> 01:51:28.450
important in terms of their development and bonding and all these things.

1827
01:51:28.451 --> 01:51:29.890
And I say, absolutely,

1828
01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:34.420
how do we create a financial product that gets you money early in your life when

1829
01:51:34.421 --> 01:51:38.830
you need it? And then you know, maybe you pay something out when you're like,

1830
01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:41.620
it's just a different diagnosis as to what the problem is.

1831
01:51:41.620 --> 01:51:46.270
It's not all oppression. Part of it is resources and financial products.

1832
01:51:46.271 --> 01:51:48.040
Part of it is interest.

1833
01:51:48.041 --> 01:51:51.100
Part of it is the fields being set up in a way that is biased.

1834
01:51:51.310 --> 01:51:53.320
I do believe in structural oppression.

1835
01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:56.890
I just don't believe in the level of structural oppression or the remedies for

1836
01:51:57.360 --> 01:52:00.760
Starks structural oppression. Like if we don't,

1837
01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:04.450
we are losing many of the best minds that are on female shoulders.

1838
01:52:05.150 --> 01:52:09.610
We've just are. There's no question about it. My mind. And rather than saying,

1839
01:52:09.670 --> 01:52:13.250
what do you mean by we're losing them? Well, they exit the system. We, we, they,

1840
01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:17.230
they, they get through the like let's say bas and stem subjects.

1841
01:52:17.710 --> 01:52:19.330
A lot of them enter PHD programs. Like,

1842
01:52:19.331 --> 01:52:23.320
let me give a very simple example from the Harvard math department from years

1843
01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:24.153
ago,

1844
01:52:24.220 --> 01:52:28.180
I think Harvard had this weird thing where it would very often allow one woman

1845
01:52:28.181 --> 01:52:32.530
in a year to the phd program in mathematics and that person usually felt

1846
01:52:32.531 --> 01:52:37.531
isolated and would often kind of leave the program and then one year a female

1847
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:40.750
who is admitted deferred.

1848
01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:45.200
So that meant that there were two women starting the next year and they formed a

1849
01:52:45.201 --> 01:52:49.280
support network and they both got through and then other women came in after

1850
01:52:49.281 --> 01:52:53.360
them. So it was like, oh, that's interesting. We just learned something.

1851
01:52:54.530 --> 01:52:56.660
Right. If you, if you let women in in pairs,

1852
01:52:56.661 --> 01:52:59.810
maybe they're going to do better and then then maybe three will do better or

1853
01:52:59.811 --> 01:53:02.330
four will do better. Okay.

1854
01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:07.540
I'm totally up for that kind of a remediation up until we can build up enough

1855
01:53:08.630 --> 01:53:12.170
female experience so that women have role models.

1856
01:53:12.370 --> 01:53:17.300
I think it's really helpful to be able to look at a senior female researcher and

1857
01:53:17.301 --> 01:53:21.320
go to her and say, how did you do it? You got married, you had kids,

1858
01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:24.860
you had a very successful career. How did you come back? You know,

1859
01:53:24.861 --> 01:53:25.850
one of the things I found,

1860
01:53:25.851 --> 01:53:30.560
I used to be interested in this problem and I found that a lot of the women in

1861
01:53:30.561 --> 01:53:33.230
the 1950s were very successful in stem subjects,

1862
01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:38.680
had a lot of money or their husbands had stable jobs that allowed them to use

1863
01:53:39.291 --> 01:53:43.820
nannies and housekeeping in order to free themselves from drudgery.

1864
01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:48.320
Well that was an unamortized feature of the system because that's not available

1865
01:53:48.321 --> 01:53:52.570
to everyone. That's a, it's a feature where financial privilege, uh,

1866
01:53:52.650 --> 01:53:56.690
actually enabled somebody to stay in science. So, you know,

1867
01:53:56.840 --> 01:54:00.890
the issue isn't a question of inclusion or exclusion of groups.

1868
01:54:01.580 --> 01:54:05.270
It's a question of how are you so sure that everything is structural oppression.

1869
01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:07.430
That's, that's a really weird thing.

1870
01:54:07.431 --> 01:54:11.630
And if you can launch that objection cheaply, if you can just say,

1871
01:54:11.631 --> 01:54:14.720
I can take any group and say, why is this group have no one in a wheelchair?

1872
01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:20.810
Now I've got to spend 30 minutes explaining that. Right? I don't want to do it.

1873
01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:24.080
It's not a good enough objection. Like if we're going to make progress,

1874
01:54:24.081 --> 01:54:27.230
let's actually make progress that matters rather than making ourselves feel

1875
01:54:27.231 --> 01:54:27.800
good.

1876
01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:32.800
Why do you think that this social justice movement has reached such hysterical

1877
01:54:35.301 --> 01:54:39.380
levels over the last decade? Well, a couple things. One, I think that,

1878
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:41.090
um,

1879
01:54:41.090 --> 01:54:46.090
certain positions became like the failing business of traditional media meant

1880
01:54:47.751 --> 01:54:51.920
that you couldn't actually employ people, uh,

1881
01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:54.290
at the same level that you could employ them before.

1882
01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:59.800
So a lot of people who didn't have huge opportunity costs entered journalism.

1883
01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:04.310
Um, what does that mean about huge opportunity for us?

1884
01:55:04.670 --> 01:55:05.990
Let's imagine for example,

1885
01:55:06.020 --> 01:55:10.850
that you're very ideological and somebody offers you a,

1886
01:55:12.230 --> 01:55:14.240
uh, $50,000 a year job,

1887
01:55:14.270 --> 01:55:18.890
which allows you to be ideological or you could take $150,000 a year job.

1888
01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:23.060
And ideology isn't a large part of, of, uh, the offer.

1889
01:55:24.740 --> 01:55:28.790
Only the ideological people are going to give up $100,000 a year for the

1890
01:55:28.791 --> 01:55:30.680
privilege of activism.

1891
01:55:31.750 --> 01:55:34.850
[inaudible] so in part when you have a failing business model,

1892
01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:37.250
you start select is a system of selective pressures.

1893
01:55:37.251 --> 01:55:39.410
It's going to start selecting for very different people.

1894
01:55:40.370 --> 01:55:42.240
So that's one of the things that's going on is,

1895
01:55:42.241 --> 01:55:47.241
is that you have very economically frustrated people because the silent

1896
01:55:47.341 --> 01:55:51.480
generation started a problem. The baby boomers amplified the hell out of it.

1897
01:55:52.010 --> 01:55:56.310
Gen X is still waiting to take its place in society and the millennials just

1898
01:55:56.311 --> 01:56:00.960
don't even see a path through, you know, standard careers.

1899
01:56:00.961 --> 01:56:04.320
Nobody's putting a, uh, a glass of scotch in their hand,

1900
01:56:04.321 --> 01:56:06.420
in a cigar in their mouth and saying, come with me kid.

1901
01:56:06.421 --> 01:56:07.740
Let me show you how it's done. Well,

1902
01:56:07.741 --> 01:56:12.741
isn't it also partly because the discussion is out there and the discussion is a

1903
01:56:13.351 --> 01:56:14.490
very attractive one.

1904
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:18.060
The discussion of one of the reasons why you haven't gotten by in this world is

1905
01:56:18.061 --> 01:56:22.650
because of inequality and because of some sort of systemic racism or systemic

1906
01:56:22.651 --> 01:56:27.450
sexism or systemic homophobia or transphobia. And it becomes,

1907
01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:31.350
when you give people an option to find an excuse,

1908
01:56:32.130 --> 01:56:35.480
they gravitate towards that excuse when you create safe space, right?

1909
01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:39.720
And you coddle and you make, all of these pieces are in place. There's many,

1910
01:56:39.721 --> 01:56:41.310
many, many moving parts. Right?

1911
01:56:41.580 --> 01:56:44.280
And I think all these little pieces are in place where we're,

1912
01:56:44.460 --> 01:56:48.450
we also have these massive echo chambers because of social media.

1913
01:56:48.660 --> 01:56:50.100
We have these people that, you know,

1914
01:56:50.101 --> 01:56:53.620
they find ideologically similar human beings and they bounce off of each other.

1915
01:56:54.660 --> 01:56:56.160
These were all real problems.

1916
01:56:56.161 --> 01:57:01.161
Like I have an intersex friend who I was seeing somebody who's indeterminate

1917
01:57:01.860 --> 01:57:05.940
between male and female physiologically. So, okay,

1918
01:57:06.420 --> 01:57:08.850
let's imagine that they have some karyotype x,

1919
01:57:08.851 --> 01:57:12.750
y profile and that the developmental process did not produce an ambiguous

1920
01:57:12.751 --> 01:57:17.730
genitalia. Okay. Okay. Is that a hermaphrodite? I don't want to, okay.

1921
01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:19.080
Just intersect. Okay.

1922
01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:24.630
This is a person I think of pretty terrific and I look at all the forms that say

1923
01:57:24.631 --> 01:57:27.150
male, female, and I just, you know,

1924
01:57:27.151 --> 01:57:30.480
my heart sinks like we're not even in trans here.

1925
01:57:30.481 --> 01:57:33.400
We're talking about somebody whose biological card that they were dealt.

1926
01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:37.440
Could have been. You could have been me, right and through no,

1927
01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:40.170
no choices at all.

1928
01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:45.360
This person is being shoehorned into a paradigm which puts them in an increased

1929
01:57:45.361 --> 01:57:48.060
risk of suicide. And it breaks my heart and we should change it.

1930
01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:52.050
We should break the male female dichotomy. Absolutely.

1931
01:57:52.110 --> 01:57:54.090
Now I have a different feeling about trans,

1932
01:57:54.750 --> 01:57:59.460
but if we solve the issue of intersects, which is not pressuring,

1933
01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:03.210
just accepting that some tiny percentage of the population which is not

1934
01:58:03.211 --> 01:58:05.490
vanishingly small, just not large,

1935
01:58:05.970 --> 01:58:10.140
is neither unambiguously male and female in terms of genotype, phenotype,

1936
01:58:10.141 --> 01:58:10.974
concordance.

1937
01:58:11.730 --> 01:58:16.020
We will do most of the work necessary to take care of our trans folks who are

1938
01:58:16.021 --> 01:58:18.360
suffering. Right now.

1939
01:58:18.361 --> 01:58:23.361
Trans is a much more rich world because there are a million different issues

1940
01:58:23.581 --> 01:58:27.310
taking place in trans and they're all conflated, you know,

1941
01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:31.590
part of it because of developmental biology part of it, because, um,

1942
01:58:31.620 --> 01:58:35.490
gender really in some sense is socially constructed in a way that like when

1943
01:58:35.491 --> 01:58:39.900
people say mathematics is socially constructed, I have to reject it. Um,

1944
01:58:40.050 --> 01:58:42.070
you know, I, and I give example of like

1945
01:58:42.190 --> 01:58:44.380
<v 0>kilts and loonies, uh,</v>

1946
01:58:44.410 --> 01:58:49.360
from Scotland in India are skirts but they're not female in those places.

1947
01:58:49.361 --> 01:58:53.290
So you have to learn about male and female relative to the codification in your

1948
01:58:53.291 --> 01:58:56.440
society and the issues of what are our,

1949
01:58:56.470 --> 01:59:00.630
what are our obligations to recognize, hey, this is really a,

1950
01:59:00.710 --> 01:59:05.710
a female mind and a male body versus this is a regular mind and irregular body,

1951
01:59:06.461 --> 01:59:09.400
but needs instruction. All of these things are conflated.

1952
01:59:09.401 --> 01:59:11.120
And I was really hoping that we, if you know,

1953
01:59:11.130 --> 01:59:15.350
if we used intersects as the test case to break them, the,

1954
01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:18.010
the binary because the binary is an oppression.

1955
01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:19.780
There's no question in my mind about it.

1956
01:59:20.710 --> 01:59:23.420
About how is it an oppression because it, let's imagine that I,

1957
01:59:23.780 --> 01:59:26.860
let's say I have persistent Mullerian duct syndrome.

1958
01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:30.160
So I'm phenotypically on the outside mail and I go to my doctor and he says,

1959
01:59:30.161 --> 01:59:34.420
Hey, you've got a uterus. What? Yeah, you have a uterus.

1960
01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:38.230
Okay, that's an exotic situation. Um,

1961
01:59:39.190 --> 01:59:42.090
maybe I want to identify male, you know, because the,

1962
01:59:42.091 --> 01:59:46.060
the outside equipment looks male. It's a, it's a, it's a weird situation.

1963
01:59:46.061 --> 01:59:49.300
Maybe the idea is that we're talking to an extremely rare circumstances.

1964
01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:53.690
So does that really define it as being oppressive? Like go like what is for,

1965
01:59:53.720 --> 01:59:57.820
for a friend of mine who is in neither situation, yeah, it's oppressive.

1966
01:59:58.840 --> 02:00:02.740
But I mean is it a pro? Like some people are born paralyzed, right?

1967
02:00:03.070 --> 02:00:06.100
Some we're are born with like serious neurological diseases that don't allow

1968
02:00:06.101 --> 02:00:07.720
them to be motile. That's right.

1969
02:00:07.721 --> 02:00:12.040
Like what is it oppressive if people are just recognized,

1970
02:00:12.041 --> 02:00:17.041
like most people recognize as being able to walk if there was no category called

1971
02:00:19.150 --> 02:00:23.340
um, dis disabled. Right. Okay.

1972
02:00:23.730 --> 02:00:26.260
Or in a wheelchair. Okay. No category. All right. Yeah.

1973
02:00:26.290 --> 02:00:27.123
So you've got somebody who's,

1974
02:00:27.340 --> 02:00:30.910
who's got a spinal cord injury and you've have people saying, all right,

1975
02:00:30.911 --> 02:00:35.020
everybody walked this way. What do you mean you can't walk? Get up?

1976
02:00:36.140 --> 02:00:38.470
Where are you lazy? That's what it sounds like to me.

1977
02:00:40.110 --> 02:00:43.870
Like it's one thing to recognize that not everybody is in the standard category,

1978
02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:46.480
but it's another thing to hard code,

1979
02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.890
like hard code where you talking about Java forms,

1980
02:00:51.250 --> 02:00:53.530
the federal government gives me a form. There's a binary,

1981
02:00:53.531 --> 02:00:54.850
it says male or female.

1982
02:00:55.420 --> 02:00:59.430
Let's imagine it doesn't say other or prefer not to say. Okay, so,

1983
02:00:59.431 --> 02:01:01.450
so we're just talking about filling out forms, which is,

1984
02:01:01.451 --> 02:01:03.160
how often does that take place in your life?

1985
02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:09.050
Often enough that it represents oppression where you have to look to find

1986
02:01:09.051 --> 02:01:13.240
emotional or female emotionally, emotionally, I think this is oppression.

1987
02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:16.210
Oppression, yeah. I might look,

1988
02:01:16.930 --> 02:01:21.930
maybe isn't it done under the interests of defining people simply because for

1989
02:01:22.721 --> 02:01:26.230
the most part you're dealing with males and females and for the most part

1990
02:01:26.231 --> 02:01:29.420
they're just trying to figure out what's what for their statistics.

1991
02:01:29.590 --> 02:01:31.930
But you know, again, this is, this is fine.

1992
02:01:31.931 --> 02:01:34.810
I'm glad you're asking me these questions because usually I have to be on the

1993
02:01:34.811 --> 02:01:37.180
other side of this issue. And this is really where my heart is,

1994
02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:39.980
which is I care these people. And I know

1995
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:42.950
<v 4>that in every single conservative society in the world,</v>

1996
02:01:43.270 --> 02:01:48.270
there are accommodations made for the failure of simple binaries to accommodate

1997
02:01:48.771 --> 02:01:53.130
the population. There's no society, this I,

1998
02:01:53.510 --> 02:01:56.390
there's no society so conservative that they've sorted the world into male and

1999
02:01:56.391 --> 02:01:59.120
female. You know,

2000
02:01:59.130 --> 02:02:03.400
the famous example of a in Iran of, uh, the ayatollah,

2001
02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:08.000
um, making a fatwa that said it's fine to have a gender reassignment,

2002
02:02:10.830 --> 02:02:11.250
right?

2003
02:02:11.250 --> 02:02:16.250
We have to recognize that every single population produces gender,

2004
02:02:16.351 --> 02:02:17.220
sexual ambiguity.

2005
02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:22.170
But isn't that also to get around the idea of homosexuality being aggrieved as

2006
02:02:22.171 --> 02:02:22.950
crime?

2007
02:02:22.950 --> 02:02:27.950
Cause like I believe in Iran it's illegal to have homosexual activity,

2008
02:02:28.580 --> 02:02:32.720
but you can have gender reassignment. So if you're a gay man,

2009
02:02:32.721 --> 02:02:35.660
you can choose to become a female. That's true.

2010
02:02:35.661 --> 02:02:38.430
But there's also a thriving gay scene in Tehran,

2011
02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:42.370
you know, do they have to recognize as female?

2012
02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:43.970
And there are all sorts of executions there.

2013
02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:46.580
There was a situation in India where I, you know,

2014
02:02:46.581 --> 02:02:49.310
I have more experience where you would say, oh,

2015
02:02:49.311 --> 02:02:52.610
those two people are confirmed bachelors, you know,

2016
02:02:52.611 --> 02:02:56.360
that they're so dedicated to their professions that there's no room for family

2017
02:02:56.361 --> 02:03:01.040
and they live together. Right. So like traditional societies have,

2018
02:03:01.490 --> 02:03:05.810
everybody accommodates homosexuality and failures of simple gender binaries.

2019
02:03:06.830 --> 02:03:07.820
And you know,

2020
02:03:07.821 --> 02:03:12.020
I always bring up the example of Turkish where Turkish doesn't hardcode the

2021
02:03:12.021 --> 02:03:15.470
third person singular pronoun as male or female.

2022
02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:18.260
It just has one pronoun for both. So

2023
02:03:20.020 --> 02:03:24.160
thank you for giving me the opportunity to show where my heart actually has been

2024
02:03:24.161 --> 02:03:25.090
this entire time,

2025
02:03:25.091 --> 02:03:29.680
which is I believe this is oppressive and I don't think that it presses that

2026
02:03:29.681 --> 02:03:30.514
many people,

2027
02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:34.750
but I believe that it's an important oppression that we have to realize that we

2028
02:03:34.751 --> 02:03:38.950
hard coded and that's what generated a lot of the feelings before we get to

2029
02:03:38.951 --> 02:03:39.784
trans.

2030
02:03:39.910 --> 02:03:44.910
You can simply say from the position of intersects that the world is a richer

2031
02:03:45.101 --> 02:03:48.580
place than male and female and people say, oh it's x x versus x, y. It's like,

2032
02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:50.170
no it isn't. It just isn't.

2033
02:03:51.100 --> 02:03:53.920
It for the most part is for the most part it is.

2034
02:03:53.950 --> 02:03:58.780
So in terms of it is it, it has been an edge case to deal with,

2035
02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:03.010
but that edge case is important to me. Right? Cause the edge case are,

2036
02:04:03.070 --> 02:04:05.690
they are human beings that are not only that, I actually,

2037
02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:11.110
I like people who are outside of the norms.

2038
02:04:11.740 --> 02:04:15.010
I think that probably a larger percentage of those people are going to be more

2039
02:04:15.011 --> 02:04:17.530
interesting people because they're forged in the fire.

2040
02:04:18.460 --> 02:04:21.120
So it's not just a case that you know, do you want to chase a cup,

2041
02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:22.630
a couple of edge cases.

2042
02:04:22.900 --> 02:04:26.320
Everybody with a really different experience is more important to me than

2043
02:04:26.321 --> 02:04:27.880
everyone. With the standard experience.

2044
02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:30.280
I think we have to kick take care of the standard case,

2045
02:04:31.060 --> 02:04:35.440
but I'm absolutely interested in outliers and edge cases. So

2046
02:04:36.970 --> 02:04:37.950
to get back to the,

2047
02:04:38.210 --> 02:04:39.480
<v 2>to to the line of thought</v>

2048
02:04:39.950 --> 02:04:43.460
<v 3>important distinction and what you're saying is very important because you are</v>

2049
02:04:44.110 --> 02:04:45.080
in one way,

2050
02:04:45.081 --> 02:04:49.730
someone could pigeonhole you from your earlier statement that you are not

2051
02:04:49.790 --> 02:04:54.790
interested in a lot of these different studies,

2052
02:04:54.951 --> 02:04:57.740
Grievance Studies, a lot of these, a gender studies,

2053
02:04:58.730 --> 02:05:02.570
if they in f interfere with hard science, which you are getting,

2054
02:05:02.840 --> 02:05:06.920
particularly with evolutionary biology, you're getting a lot of interference.

2055
02:05:07.260 --> 02:05:10.070
You got to right and you're not interested in that.

2056
02:05:10.071 --> 02:05:14.210
But that does not mean that you're an insensitive person that's uninsured and

2057
02:05:14.420 --> 02:05:16.980
human being. You're just not interested in the disruption of the,

2058
02:05:18.130 --> 02:05:22.610
that the acquiring of data and the analysis of said data.

2059
02:05:24.420 --> 02:05:29.420
<v 2>I don't think that activism makes for good advancement.</v>

2060
02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:31.770
Why do you think

2061
02:05:31.770 --> 02:05:36.180
<v 3>problem with who's the activist and what age you're talking about and how</v>

2062
02:05:36.181 --> 02:05:40.380
idealistic these people are and what, how are, how, going back to biology,

2063
02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:44.010
where's their mind at it? How, how formed is their mind?

2064
02:05:44.040 --> 02:05:49.040
How narrow is their view of what the world is or should be and their impact?

2065
02:05:49.650 --> 02:05:51.810
You know, what, what, what's, what's significant about [inaudible]

2066
02:05:52.010 --> 02:05:55.700
<v 2>but my, my disagreement, just give you an idea of where my energy comes from.</v>

2067
02:05:57.740 --> 02:06:02.210
Let's imagine that you actually believe that males and females are equally

2068
02:06:02.211 --> 02:06:06.590
intelligent. Okay. Just fishery and equivalents.

2069
02:06:06.620 --> 02:06:07.580
Can I say lol?

2070
02:06:12.650 --> 02:06:14.150
Then your, then what would you be?

2071
02:06:14.151 --> 02:06:18.770
You'd be fascinated as to why you don't have males and females in an

2072
02:06:18.771 --> 02:06:20.690
intellectually depending in equal numbers in any,

2073
02:06:20.810 --> 02:06:25.100
in an in a demanding occupation. So you'd start saying, Huh,

2074
02:06:25.130 --> 02:06:28.670
if I already assumed that males and females are equally intelligent,

2075
02:06:28.671 --> 02:06:32.030
I care about different categories. How much of this is about fertility?

2076
02:06:32.031 --> 02:06:33.500
How much of this is about kin work?

2077
02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:36.110
How much of about of this is about structural oppression?

2078
02:06:36.290 --> 02:06:38.000
How much of this is about path dependence?

2079
02:06:38.330 --> 02:06:43.330
You do some very careful thing in order to understand your problem and only when

2080
02:06:44.211 --> 02:06:47.930
you'd finally understood your problem would you say, okay,

2081
02:06:47.931 --> 02:06:49.700
now I have an idea of how to remediate it.

2082
02:06:49.730 --> 02:06:53.360
We need a financial product that transfers money from late life to early life

2083
02:06:53.361 --> 02:06:57.710
because this huge burden that knocks women out of the stem pipeline might be,

2084
02:06:58.580 --> 02:07:02.360
uh, that they have to take care of elderly parents or young kids. Bingo.

2085
02:07:02.920 --> 02:07:06.740
Now you, now you're working in a totally different idiom because you've,

2086
02:07:06.770 --> 02:07:11.360
you've actually come up with a different idea or for example, um, if,

2087
02:07:11.580 --> 02:07:12.200
if you make,

2088
02:07:12.200 --> 02:07:16.370
if you hard coat like Sean Carroll I think just had a podcast in which he said

2089
02:07:16.371 --> 02:07:18.370
something to the effect of, well,

2090
02:07:18.430 --> 02:07:21.650
on the IDW is kind of into interested in race and IQ.

2091
02:07:22.670 --> 02:07:24.890
I have never been interested in race and IQ.

2092
02:07:25.070 --> 02:07:29.780
The only time I became interested in race and IQ was when I started hearing.

2093
02:07:30.170 --> 02:07:34.340
There is absolutely no variation between groups and you know,

2094
02:07:34.490 --> 02:07:36.370
in any of a cognitive

2095
02:07:36.370 --> 02:07:39.130
<v 0>endowment. Well certainly there is in terms of height,</v>

2096
02:07:39.131 --> 02:07:41.560
the ability to radiate heat melanin can attend to the skin.

2097
02:07:41.740 --> 02:07:42.820
The ability to absorb sunlight.

2098
02:07:43.420 --> 02:07:48.280
It doesn't pass the smell test that you could be able to say that a priori,

2099
02:07:48.420 --> 02:07:50.560
it's just, it's not a scientific type statement.

2100
02:07:51.130 --> 02:07:52.630
It's something you'd have to investigate.

2101
02:07:53.710 --> 02:07:58.450
So in that situation, am I interested in,

2102
02:07:58.451 --> 02:08:02.320
in some finding that says that one group is smarter and other groups are not as

2103
02:08:02.321 --> 02:08:04.510
smart? Do I believe that IQ equals smartness? No,

2104
02:08:04.511 --> 02:08:08.200
I don't believe IQ equals smartness. Do I believe that there's no cultural bias?

2105
02:08:08.201 --> 02:08:10.450
I think there is cultural bias. I, you know, I've,

2106
02:08:10.510 --> 02:08:13.420
I'm definitely on record of saying, um,

2107
02:08:13.450 --> 02:08:18.450
there are ways in which groups that are said to a fair less well in terms of IQ,

2108
02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:24.640
uh, demonstrate actual intellectual dominance. This is some rich,

2109
02:08:24.641 --> 02:08:27.160
weird area I've never cared about before.

2110
02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:31.750
And the only reason that it becomes interesting to me, um,

2111
02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:34.110
is that suddenly we're,

2112
02:08:34.111 --> 02:08:39.010
we're making these incredible proclamations with certainty. Like,

2113
02:08:39.011 --> 02:08:42.190
you know, you can't say this word or this is absolutely true.

2114
02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:46.030
And like life doesn't work like that. There's no word in the English language.

2115
02:08:46.060 --> 02:08:49.570
George Carlin made this point all the time. There are no bad words.

2116
02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:53.320
There's bad intent. They're bad people. Well,

2117
02:08:53.321 --> 02:08:56.350
isn't that also the issue being a part of a group?

2118
02:08:57.230 --> 02:09:02.230
Say More I the IDW is too interested in race and IQ.

2119
02:09:02.861 --> 02:09:07.060
I'm not. I'm not. Who is, I mean I'm really not. I don't discuss that at all.

2120
02:09:07.061 --> 02:09:10.300
I understand, but who? Who is interest? Sam Harris has discussed it before,

2121
02:09:10.301 --> 02:09:13.090
but he discussed it with someone who is studying. I don't think Sam, Karen.

2122
02:09:13.091 --> 02:09:14.470
I think that Sam felt that he had,

2123
02:09:14.530 --> 02:09:19.530
Sam felt the Charles Murray had been railroaded by him by he Sam Harris,

2124
02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:25.420
and then as Sam came to understand what it is like to have a mob turn on you.

2125
02:09:26.200 --> 02:09:26.771
Sam said,

2126
02:09:26.771 --> 02:09:30.160
maybe I'm wrong about Charles Myrrh and then air as reclined made this really

2127
02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:35.530
interesting point in a really unfair way against Sam, which was basically like,

2128
02:09:35.531 --> 02:09:38.110
hey, you don't know what Charles Murray is. He's a hybrid.

2129
02:09:38.111 --> 02:09:42.340
He's not just a social scientist. He's also got an agenda. Right?

2130
02:09:42.370 --> 02:09:45.910
Is that accurate? I think so. I've never read Marie's work,

2131
02:09:45.911 --> 02:09:48.700
but I don't know enough to say either, but I believe polarizing.

2132
02:09:50.230 --> 02:09:51.340
I think Al Curve,

2133
02:09:51.341 --> 02:09:55.690
the whole idea about being able to recognize a,

2134
02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:59.290
the differences in gender and race and IQ,

2135
02:09:59.380 --> 02:10:03.700
it's like it's a very contentious subject. Both analyze.

2136
02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:09.040
I mean, look, I have to admit that I don't score that well on certain tests,

2137
02:10:09.580 --> 02:10:14.580
so I have a built in total skepticism of IQ tests,

2138
02:10:16.211 --> 02:10:18.160
sat test, act tests,

2139
02:10:18.220 --> 02:10:23.170
any kind of test because it's an unnatural examination, not intelligence.

2140
02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:28.090
It just isn't, what is it? It's a proxy. Like there are people who think, oh,

2141
02:10:28.091 --> 02:10:29.470
it's a really good proxy.

2142
02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:32.590
I'll never met someone who has a really high IQ though,

2143
02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:36.860
that I deemed to be intellectually inferior. Yeah.

2144
02:10:36.861 --> 02:10:41.270
But I've met people who don't have very high iqs who just blow me away. Yes.

2145
02:10:41.320 --> 02:10:43.520
Right. Well, there's absolutely,

2146
02:10:43.521 --> 02:10:47.120
there's a type of intelligence a certain people possessed particularly creative

2147
02:10:47.121 --> 02:10:48.140
intelligence. Yeah.

2148
02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:52.820
There's a creative and like there's certain people that might not score well on

2149
02:10:52.821 --> 02:10:56.900
sat tests, but they're capable of producing amazing stuff,

2150
02:10:56.930 --> 02:11:00.920
whether it's literature, comedy, whatever. Whenever it is movies,

2151
02:11:01.160 --> 02:11:03.110
they can make things, they can do things.

2152
02:11:03.111 --> 02:11:08.111
They have a genius in their ability and that requires some intelligence.

2153
02:11:08.421 --> 02:11:13.160
It requires some immeasurable. There's something that you can't put on a scale.

2154
02:11:13.190 --> 02:11:15.920
Well, this is about, you know what I said to Jordan, I said, Jordan Peterson.

2155
02:11:15.921 --> 02:11:19.310
I said, I don't think I have an IQ because the conceit,

2156
02:11:19.640 --> 02:11:21.530
we have to remember that a priori,

2157
02:11:21.531 --> 02:11:25.040
we would always have guessed that I t intelligence was many different things.

2158
02:11:25.820 --> 02:11:28.860
It was a composite of like lots of different types of intelligence.

2159
02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:33.170
The concede around IQ is you'd think that was true. But guess again,

2160
02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:38.090
there's essentially one kind of intelligence. There's one scale.

2161
02:11:38.150 --> 02:11:41.870
It's a surprise. Oh, that's, that's really surprising.

2162
02:11:42.140 --> 02:11:45.950
Tell me something of the various forms of intelligence is one of the things that

2163
02:11:45.951 --> 02:11:50.270
you call intelligence processing. Yes. Yes. Processing, very important.

2164
02:11:50.810 --> 02:11:53.720
Okay. I don't score well on processing. In fact,

2165
02:11:53.721 --> 02:11:55.880
I don't think anyone in my family has ever scored well On.

2166
02:11:55.881 --> 02:11:58.790
What do you mean by processing? I don't know. Some kind of, um,

2167
02:12:00.140 --> 02:12:04.860
mechanical process of how quickly and flawlessly you can encode information,

2168
02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:09.220
play with it and get it out. You know, like if you're a dyslexic, well,

2169
02:12:09.710 --> 02:12:13.430
let's take spelling. Lots of people on Twitter say,

2170
02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:16.370
ha ha you misspelled here. Uh,

2171
02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:19.100
in fact it's h e Ar in the case that you meant,

2172
02:12:19.130 --> 02:12:22.460
it really just shows me something about your intelligence that you can't keep

2173
02:12:22.461 --> 02:12:25.880
track of spelling. Okay. That's your level of thought.

2174
02:12:26.060 --> 02:12:30.290
Do you happen to know how many brilliant people can't, can't spell, can't write.

2175
02:12:30.590 --> 02:12:32.210
Well also you're not even thinking,

2176
02:12:32.211 --> 02:12:34.690
you're just trying to get the word out and you miss step. Yeah.

2177
02:12:34.710 --> 02:12:36.820
But like my mind, you know,

2178
02:12:37.130 --> 02:12:40.280
at some point I got sent home I think because I was asked to draw a chicken in

2179
02:12:40.281 --> 02:12:44.600
school and I put two wings and four feet on it. I'm so non observant. My, my,

2180
02:12:45.170 --> 02:12:49.070
my handwriting might at home. Yeah. Something like this. They sent you home.

2181
02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:51.290
I was like abberant or you know,

2182
02:12:51.291 --> 02:12:54.460
I was making fun of the teacher cause it was for like a check, you know,

2183
02:12:54.530 --> 02:12:58.640
famously Mrs Buckero in first grade sent me out of the class because I said that

2184
02:12:58.641 --> 02:13:03.090
a spider wasn't an insect because it had eight legs and that she sent you out of

2185
02:13:03.130 --> 02:13:05.210
the class. Yeah, because I was, well you're correct.

2186
02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:08.510
In that case I was in the case of a chicken, I wasn't,

2187
02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:12.990
but well maybe he saw some weird fucking Chernobyl chicken. So yeah, man.

2188
02:13:13.370 --> 02:13:16.980
Chernobyl chicken, chicken Kiev. That's good. That's comedy goal.

2189
02:13:17.870 --> 02:13:18.560
My point,

2190
02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:23.560
my point being that if you don't have a high confidence in net normal metrics,

2191
02:13:24.170 --> 02:13:29.170
the race and IQ discussion doesn't land like so to get back to Charles Martin.

2192
02:13:30.140 --> 02:13:31.590
So Charles Murray

2193
02:13:32.410 --> 02:13:35.730
<v 3>is it book, it's hard to say.</v>

2194
02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:39.300
He wrote the bell curve, right?

2195
02:13:39.330 --> 02:13:44.330
A was either dismissed as being racist or applauded by people who you would call

2196
02:13:47.131 --> 02:13:51.660
white nationalists who tried out his ideas as proof,

2197
02:13:52.050 --> 02:13:56.400
as measurable proof that certain races are superior and you know,

2198
02:13:56.401 --> 02:14:01.401
we could discuss the online people who trot those out all the time and they use

2199
02:14:03.511 --> 02:14:08.110
it to form these weird groups of people that love to hear that. Right.

2200
02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:10.800
And that smacks of racist. So this is the issue,

2201
02:14:10.801 --> 02:14:15.801
which is you have a situation in which he appeared to heavy political

2202
02:14:16.891 --> 02:14:17.850
orientation,

2203
02:14:17.940 --> 02:14:21.300
which is that he didn't want money spent in certain ways and he wanted it spent

2204
02:14:21.301 --> 02:14:23.040
in others. There.

2205
02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:28.640
There was an in political interpretation of why he wanted that,

2206
02:14:30.450 --> 02:14:32.640
which was maybe he's a closet racist.

2207
02:14:32.790 --> 02:14:37.790
Then there was facts that will tend to empower people who are actually racist.

2208
02:14:39.300 --> 02:14:40.610
All right, but let me pause you there. Sure.

2209
02:14:40.710 --> 02:14:45.690
But then there's the actual data right now in examining the actual data,

2210
02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:49.170
if you just look at the actual data is,

2211
02:14:49.290 --> 02:14:51.780
is it racist to look at the,

2212
02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:57.180
the real numbers I give you say Nigerians in particular who are incredibly

2213
02:14:57.181 --> 02:14:59.270
industrious and some of the more, um,

2214
02:14:59.550 --> 02:15:03.690
successful immigrant groups that come over to America also happened to be black.

2215
02:15:03.900 --> 02:15:08.340
If you wanted to look at Nigerians in terms of like, if you wanted to, if you,

2216
02:15:08.370 --> 02:15:13.350
if you, if all, if you, if you wanted to look at them particularly as a group,

2217
02:15:13.351 --> 02:15:16.200
be very difficult to be racist. You'd have to say, wow, this is,

2218
02:15:16.201 --> 02:15:19.620
these are superior. Lot of superior intellects come from Nigeria.

2219
02:15:19.770 --> 02:15:22.980
They also tried out the Asian one, right? That ate like this.

2220
02:15:22.981 --> 02:15:26.220
One of the weird things that people like to show that they're not racist.

2221
02:15:26.550 --> 02:15:31.000
Like look at shows. Asians are of a superior IQ. Aye. Aye.

2222
02:15:31.410 --> 02:15:34.530
Aye Puzzle on that one. That one's puzzling.

2223
02:15:34.531 --> 02:15:38.730
Say More because I think with certain people,

2224
02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:42.600
with certain males, let's just go with males.

2225
02:15:43.020 --> 02:15:48.020
They look at African Americans and they see superiority in in certain ways,

2226
02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:55.160
they see superiority athletically, artistically, musically.

2227
02:15:55.260 --> 02:16:00.260
If you look at the contributions of African Americans culturally across the

2228
02:16:01.051 --> 02:16:04.530
board in terms of like the real, the, the Jimmy Hendrix, the Beatles,

2229
02:16:04.531 --> 02:16:08.010
Davis seed of thought and creativity analytic,

2230
02:16:08.880 --> 02:16:12.350
but not just that. Also athletically, like the,

2231
02:16:12.420 --> 02:16:16.500
the fucking outliers are just so many. There's so many. Michael Jordan's,

2232
02:16:16.501 --> 02:16:18.090
Mike Tyson, sugar ray Leonard's,

2233
02:16:18.330 --> 02:16:23.330
there's so many African American outliers who are just extraordinary in terms of

2234
02:16:23.701 --> 02:16:28.380
their accomplishments, but not that many Asian Americans in that regard.

2235
02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:33.070
So it's almost like they'll concede like they're not doing the things that make

2236
02:16:33.071 --> 02:16:36.070
me jealous. Do you see what I'm saying? They're not,

2237
02:16:36.310 --> 02:16:40.270
they're not creating this insane music, although there are few. Right.

2238
02:16:40.420 --> 02:16:44.890
But overall they're not creating these insane athletic accomplishments that

2239
02:16:44.891 --> 02:16:49.210
these white Americans can't keep up with. Right. So we'll say, but look,

2240
02:16:49.420 --> 02:16:51.940
they're superior intellectually, so I can't be racist.

2241
02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:55.990
I am pointing out that these Asians who I'm not jealous of because they don't do

2242
02:16:55.991 --> 02:16:58.030
the things that I wish that I could do.

2243
02:16:58.390 --> 02:17:00.430
But then when it comes to the African Americans,

2244
02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:04.540
you're there pointing out all the things of the African Americans can do that

2245
02:17:04.541 --> 02:17:05.374
they can't do,

2246
02:17:05.740 --> 02:17:08.830
but they're saying all but they're intellectually inferior by this is proven.

2247
02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:12.820
I'm not racist. I don't want this to be true. But it seems to be true. I see.

2248
02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:15.370
You see what I'm saying? It's like a way of,

2249
02:17:15.820 --> 02:17:19.390
it's a way of suppressing accomplishment, right?

2250
02:17:19.900 --> 02:17:23.470
While like almost mitigating the impact of the, the,

2251
02:17:23.471 --> 02:17:26.770
the jealousy that they feel. So if you think about, for example, first,

2252
02:17:26.771 --> 02:17:27.604
does that make sense?

2253
02:17:27.690 --> 02:17:32.500
<v 4>I th I think so. Um, first of all, I just,</v>

2254
02:17:33.700 --> 02:17:34.690
I hate this topic.

2255
02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:37.070
<v 3>Yeah, me too. It's a weird topic cause it's a weird topic.</v>

2256
02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:38.920
It feels greasy even touching it.

2257
02:17:40.050 --> 02:17:42.900
<v 4>But now we have to write like this. I feel like</v>

2258
02:17:45.030 --> 02:17:48.840
my wrong view of it is if you'd never brought this thing up,

2259
02:17:48.841 --> 02:17:50.220
we would never have had to deal with it.

2260
02:17:50.221 --> 02:17:53.640
And I no longer believe that's true because we have so much inadvertent data,

2261
02:17:54.570 --> 02:17:59.400
right? Like I don't want, um, the data on chess.

2262
02:17:59.790 --> 02:18:03.840
We have an idea of how many grandmasters there are in which groups like male,

2263
02:18:03.841 --> 02:18:07.500
female, Asian, black, you know, various portions of Europe.

2264
02:18:08.430 --> 02:18:10.170
I don't know what that data means,

2265
02:18:10.710 --> 02:18:13.770
but I can't stop the data because it's going to be generated even if nobody

2266
02:18:13.771 --> 02:18:17.070
comes up with a standardized test because it's a game and it's scored and it has

2267
02:18:17.071 --> 02:18:21.360
something to do with intellectual abilities, right? On the other hand,

2268
02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:26.460
I mean, I'm a competitive guy and I, I, um, you do comedy, I do some,

2269
02:18:26.490 --> 02:18:28.440
some amount of music. Uh,

2270
02:18:28.740 --> 02:18:32.460
I can guarantee you that both of us have had our ass kicked at some point by

2271
02:18:32.461 --> 02:18:37.050
African Americans who excel in both of these areas. And I don't mean, um,

2272
02:18:37.500 --> 02:18:41.730
you know, all God's children got rid of them. I mean, getting out funk, uh,

2273
02:18:41.910 --> 02:18:45.390
in a competitive situation, um, you know,

2274
02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:49.260
looking over somebody's shoulder on the keyboard and they're thinking so quickly

2275
02:18:49.261 --> 02:18:52.410
and in so many dimensions, I can't even imagine what the hell is going on.

2276
02:18:52.980 --> 02:18:57.120
Right? So therefore I never had a lot of fear about it because I, you know,

2277
02:18:57.121 --> 02:19:02.121
I'm in close proximity with somebody who's just kicking my ass and um,

2278
02:19:05.730 --> 02:19:07.860
therefore I thought I could leave these topics alone.

2279
02:19:07.861 --> 02:19:10.590
I would never have to deal with it. The way in which that they come up,

2280
02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:14.640
you know, in a way that is really unpleasant is this new thing,

2281
02:19:14.641 --> 02:19:19.350
which is that all imbalances are all structural oppression. Right.

2282
02:19:19.351 --> 02:19:24.030
And which doesn't allow for tradeoffs between groups like fins.

2283
02:19:24.870 --> 02:19:26.730
Fins are good at some things. They're not good at others.

2284
02:19:27.050 --> 02:19:29.600
Nobody believes in like anti finished prejudice.

2285
02:19:30.020 --> 02:19:33.110
So we don't think about it all right. It's just not a,

2286
02:19:33.140 --> 02:19:36.320
it's not a big issue for us now. Finnish humor,

2287
02:19:36.321 --> 02:19:40.470
how many finished comedians are there have no idea. Right.

2288
02:19:40.740 --> 02:19:43.600
Well how many do you run into at the comedy store? That's a bet

2289
02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:46.160
<v 1>bad example because you're dealing with America,</v>

2290
02:19:46.430 --> 02:19:50.960
America in American comedy and also you're also dealing with the highest level

2291
02:19:50.961 --> 02:19:55.490
of the game. It's like, you know, the, the comedy store is essentially like the,

2292
02:19:56.690 --> 02:19:59.810
it's like the Harvard research labs of standup comedy. Yeah.

2293
02:19:59.920 --> 02:20:00.753
<v 4>But</v>

2294
02:20:02.920 --> 02:20:04.990
nobody's worried about anti finish behavior.

2295
02:20:05.530 --> 02:20:08.230
We're worried that we're prejudiced against certain groups.

2296
02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:10.390
We're worried that we're prejudiced against Jews.

2297
02:20:10.420 --> 02:20:13.210
We're worried of that we're prejudice against Mexicans against blacks.

2298
02:20:13.480 --> 02:20:18.480
We have a pretty clean idea of what bigotry we really still need to worry about.

2299
02:20:19.700 --> 02:20:21.220
Right. And we feel guilty about it.

2300
02:20:21.250 --> 02:20:24.490
And that's why you say it has this kind of lubricious quality to that.

2301
02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:27.460
What are you really up to over there? Well, why are you looking at that Dataset?

2302
02:20:28.340 --> 02:20:33.130
Right? And what my comment is is I don't know how to stop this thing.

2303
02:20:33.580 --> 02:20:35.710
I'm not excited about it. I'm not interested in it.

2304
02:20:36.220 --> 02:20:39.910
I definitely think that we have to actually think about the social implications

2305
02:20:39.911 --> 02:20:41.140
of all of these things. But if your,

2306
02:20:41.200 --> 02:20:44.710
if your ideas that we're going to stop this at the level of data and analysis,

2307
02:20:45.490 --> 02:20:48.580
I can't afford that. I just can't afford that.

2308
02:20:48.581 --> 02:20:52.510
We need to have somebody who is able, like for example, microcephaly.

2309
02:20:53.320 --> 02:20:55.540
You've got people with smaller heads than the rest of us.

2310
02:20:55.541 --> 02:20:58.450
Maybe because of the Zika virus. Well, is it,

2311
02:20:59.110 --> 02:21:03.820
is it unethical to study what the cognitive impairment due to Microcephaly is?

2312
02:21:04.200 --> 02:21:05.080
Right? I don't know.

2313
02:21:05.780 --> 02:21:06.531
<v 1>I Dunno what to do,</v>

2314
02:21:06.531 --> 02:21:09.630
but I know that I want to have a very thoughtful conversation about how can it

2315
02:21:09.820 --> 02:21:10.530
be,

2316
02:21:10.530 --> 02:21:14.180
how can it be unethical to study the cognitive impairment of someone who should

2317
02:21:14.181 --> 02:21:18.710
affect affected by a disease? And that could possibly help fund research,

2318
02:21:18.920 --> 02:21:22.550
help fund preventative measures. Why would there's a correlation with,

2319
02:21:22.551 --> 02:21:25.220
with smaller heads and cognitive impairment, you know,

2320
02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:29.330
and like what does somebody like, let's take mosaic down syndrome.

2321
02:21:29.331 --> 02:21:33.560
Mosaic Down Syndrome doesn't have the same profile as regular downs syndrome.

2322
02:21:33.950 --> 02:21:37.400
You get much higher functioning people, right? I mean,

2323
02:21:37.640 --> 02:21:41.210
ultimately we're all souls and we have to figure it dignity and we have to

2324
02:21:41.211 --> 02:21:45.650
figure out some system by which we can live with this increased level of

2325
02:21:45.651 --> 02:21:50.030
knowledge, but does examining impairment, right?

2326
02:21:50.180 --> 02:21:53.360
Does that really mean that it's a prejudiced?

2327
02:21:53.390 --> 02:21:56.570
Like what about an examining impairment from people who've been injured?

2328
02:21:56.750 --> 02:21:59.300
Should we avoid doing that because we don't want to be ablest.

2329
02:22:01.810 --> 02:22:02.643
<v 4>Um,</v>

2330
02:22:03.460 --> 02:22:06.650
<v 1>do you see what I'm saying? Not Quite, because we're talking about reality,</v>

2331
02:22:06.680 --> 02:22:09.170
right? We're talking about issues. If you're,

2332
02:22:09.171 --> 02:22:14.171
if you're examining someone who contracted the Zika virus and it led to them

2333
02:22:14.361 --> 02:22:17.180
developing a smaller head, which is one of the horrible side effects of that,

2334
02:22:17.640 --> 02:22:21.290
is examining that in some way, some sort of prejudice.

2335
02:22:21.450 --> 02:22:24.980
It should we avoid examining their cognitive. If we avoid examining it,

2336
02:22:24.990 --> 02:22:26.160
we might do some damage.

2337
02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:29.490
<v 2>If we examine it and publish the findings, we might do da do da.</v>

2338
02:22:29.520 --> 02:22:33.690
I mean [inaudible] might do damage to the people that are in fact look or

2339
02:22:33.691 --> 02:22:38.691
afflict if we don't begin with an idea that ultimately the issue is compassion

2340
02:22:40.051 --> 02:22:45.051
for ourselves and others and that a lot of our genetics and our,

2341
02:22:45.510 --> 02:22:49.590
his history dis predisposes us to bad behavior now that we're living with each

2342
02:22:49.591 --> 02:22:53.760
other. Like we have to start, I mean as hippy dippy as a salad,

2343
02:22:53.850 --> 02:22:57.840
you have to start from a place of love and decency. I care. I certainly agree,

2344
02:22:57.841 --> 02:23:01.220
but I think that we should avoid reality. This is the thing, right? Yeah.

2345
02:23:01.410 --> 02:23:06.410
So now I have this other thing which is reality is compassionate in and of

2346
02:23:06.631 --> 02:23:07.051
itself.

2347
02:23:07.051 --> 02:23:10.800
Remember when HIV was an equal opportunity disease and it just started in the

2348
02:23:10.801 --> 02:23:14.460
gay community and it's gonna jump the fire road and it's going to be as much a

2349
02:23:14.461 --> 02:23:17.940
heterosexual problem as it was a homosexual problem that turned out not to be

2350
02:23:17.941 --> 02:23:18.774
true.

2351
02:23:19.140 --> 02:23:24.090
It was an ideological statement that didn't look at the differences between

2352
02:23:24.091 --> 02:23:27.600
different kinds of epithelium and different sexual practices between gays and

2353
02:23:27.601 --> 02:23:29.610
straights. It was a, it was a,

2354
02:23:29.670 --> 02:23:34.670
an activist position that started to compete with a epidemiological position or

2355
02:23:36.361 --> 02:23:37.680
a biological position.

2356
02:23:38.310 --> 02:23:43.310
And so historically what we did is we had private expert communication.

2357
02:23:44.970 --> 02:23:48.090
Um, and it's not always clear that you can trust your experts.

2358
02:23:48.091 --> 02:23:50.880
It's not always clear that you should start with the data.

2359
02:23:50.881 --> 02:23:52.620
What if the data says terrible things,

2360
02:23:52.920 --> 02:23:56.190
like maybe the data on people with Microcephaly, um,

2361
02:23:56.220 --> 02:24:00.000
says something and you have got a person who's going to be judged by the size of

2362
02:24:00.001 --> 02:24:03.480
their head, which is visibly off from the rest of their body. You know, we,

2363
02:24:03.600 --> 02:24:07.740
we haven't taken up the challenge of our time, which is okay,

2364
02:24:07.860 --> 02:24:10.620
we got a lot more information than we wanted and we have a lot more ability to

2365
02:24:10.621 --> 02:24:12.960
analyze it and we know something about ourselves.

2366
02:24:13.200 --> 02:24:15.660
We know that we have got bigotry as part of our,

2367
02:24:15.870 --> 02:24:19.200
our makeup and we know that, um,

2368
02:24:19.920 --> 02:24:24.330
we're not really good at certain ways of integrating information and not,

2369
02:24:24.420 --> 02:24:24.631
you know,

2370
02:24:24.631 --> 02:24:28.770
becoming triumphalist and jerkish about it and taking victory lapses if it's a

2371
02:24:28.771 --> 02:24:31.110
competition like my groups better than your group. Right?

2372
02:24:31.770 --> 02:24:33.330
So that's where we're stuck.

2373
02:24:33.390 --> 02:24:38.010
Now I want to be struggling with other people are saying, look,

2374
02:24:38.190 --> 02:24:41.250
I don't know what the answers are. I don't think, you know,

2375
02:24:41.251 --> 02:24:42.090
as I brought up before,

2376
02:24:42.091 --> 02:24:45.630
I don't think East Africans are cheating in the Boston marathon because they've

2377
02:24:45.631 --> 02:24:48.750
come to dominate it. Just because you know,

2378
02:24:48.751 --> 02:24:53.490
suddenly you had a diverse group of people replaced by a very tiny group from

2379
02:24:53.491 --> 02:24:55.530
Ethiopia and Kenya. We are,

2380
02:24:55.820 --> 02:25:00.820
we are behaving as you would expect when compassionate people who recognize that

2381
02:25:01.950 --> 02:25:05.610
they have been bigoted and structurally oppressive

2382
02:25:07.170 --> 02:25:08.910
encountered data that they can't handle,

2383
02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:12.600
which the science is giving us more data than we ever wanted on these things.

2384
02:25:12.900 --> 02:25:16.380
And we're not answering the challenge of our time. And that's what my issue is,

2385
02:25:16.381 --> 02:25:19.410
social justices. It's not about,

2386
02:25:20.310 --> 02:25:23.040
I don't want a better planet or more inclusive.

2387
02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:28.390
<v 4>It's like stop crowding out the really difficult,</v>

2388
02:25:28.660 --> 02:25:29.500
interesting,

2389
02:25:30.610 --> 02:25:35.610
openhearted and hardheaded conversation with this dime store nonsense about

2390
02:25:36.311 --> 02:25:37.810
simple answers and simple,

2391
02:25:37.900 --> 02:25:41.290
simple truths because those aren't true and it's not going to work in the

2392
02:25:41.770 --> 02:25:42.850
longterm. I mean,

2393
02:25:42.851 --> 02:25:47.851
I guess that's maybe the idea is we're competing with social justice for the

2394
02:25:48.641 --> 02:25:53.260
rights to try to come up with a better, more equitable future.

2395
02:25:53.530 --> 02:25:57.490
And the complaint about it isn't, you guys are trying to come up with a better,

2396
02:25:57.491 --> 02:25:58.600
more equitable future.

2397
02:25:58.630 --> 02:26:02.590
It's what if you're gonna make the same mistake when we said, well,

2398
02:26:02.591 --> 02:26:06.610
the heterosexuals are as much at risk as the homosexual. Well, that wasn't true.

2399
02:26:06.611 --> 02:26:11.611
We needed to devote resources to our homosexual community and we did need to get

2400
02:26:12.041 --> 02:26:16.030
the heterosexual community interested and we had a problem and we needed to

2401
02:26:16.031 --> 02:26:17.920
think about, you know, very thoughtfully,

2402
02:26:18.370 --> 02:26:20.140
we've got an epidemic that's killing people.

2403
02:26:20.860 --> 02:26:22.870
I think when we're talking about this,

2404
02:26:23.070 --> 02:26:25.520
<v 3>I think everything you're saying resonates and everything you're saying makes</v>

2405
02:26:25.521 --> 02:26:29.330
sense. Uh, and I think when we're talking about compassionate,

2406
02:26:31.250 --> 02:26:34.940
compassionate human beings looking out for each other, right?

2407
02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.880
And that this should be something that we, all,

2408
02:26:38.930 --> 02:26:43.610
this is like one of the, one of our primary concerns whenever we address any,

2409
02:26:43.850 --> 02:26:48.560
any issue, right? I think our problem in this country, there's as many problems,

2410
02:26:48.561 --> 02:26:53.450
but one of our problems is the loudest voices on the fringes.

2411
02:26:53.960 --> 02:26:56.390
And this is one of the things that I wanted to discuss with you is what's going

2412
02:26:56.391 --> 02:26:57.224
on in Portland.

2413
02:26:57.620 --> 02:27:01.880
And I think what's going on in Portland is the loudest voices on the fringes

2414
02:27:01.881 --> 02:27:05.990
that the people on the right and on the far right and whether they are,

2415
02:27:06.910 --> 02:27:11.360
recognizes, is recognizing as emblematic of the left.

2416
02:27:11.390 --> 02:27:14.420
They think it defines the left. And I don't think it does.

2417
02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:18.710
And I think it is, it's a symptom of,

2418
02:27:19.760 --> 02:27:23.630
it's a symptom of, first of all, terrible government of, of,

2419
02:27:23.631 --> 02:27:27.020
of someone who's allowing this to flourish inside the,

2420
02:27:27.021 --> 02:27:30.470
the mayor of Portland who seems to be supporting this in some sort of a weird

2421
02:27:30.471 --> 02:27:31.630
way, weird way. And,

2422
02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:36.640
and ideologically believes that Antifa just because of a name stands for

2423
02:27:37.880 --> 02:27:39.110
antifascist. If you had no name,

2424
02:27:39.380 --> 02:27:42.500
which you would have as a bunch of hood wearing mask,

2425
02:27:42.501 --> 02:27:46.720
wearing violent thugs who are beating people who disagree with them because

2426
02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:50.350
that's what we saw with that. Andy, how do you say his name go? Is it,

2427
02:27:50.351 --> 02:27:54.440
I think it's Indian? No, no. And it's NGO, right?

2428
02:27:54.470 --> 02:27:58.050
I treated the G is silent until somebody, correct. I think you're right. Um,

2429
02:27:58.790 --> 02:28:03.790
what you saw from that video that anyone could support that of with a person

2430
02:28:04.430 --> 02:28:08.660
who's just talking, they, I mean, he, if what I've seen of him,

2431
02:28:09.020 --> 02:28:12.090
what they have tried to describe, that he supports neo-nazis,

2432
02:28:12.110 --> 02:28:14.930
that he supports the proud boy. I haven't seen none of this.

2433
02:28:15.140 --> 02:28:16.130
I've seen no evidence of this,

2434
02:28:16.131 --> 02:28:19.040
but I've seen the narrative trotted out over and over again as a justification

2435
02:28:19.041 --> 02:28:20.120
for violence against him.

2436
02:28:20.390 --> 02:28:25.390
When the supports bullying in the worst possible form,

2437
02:28:26.450 --> 02:28:31.190
ganging up on someone, punching them, hitting them with sticks, crow bars,

2438
02:28:31.370 --> 02:28:34.820
all this crazy shit thinking that it's okay to throw milkshakes at people

2439
02:28:34.940 --> 02:28:39.800
thinking that this is fine. This is nothing. If you see what I think,

2440
02:28:39.801 --> 02:28:44.600
this is a horrible precedent to set and it's a terrible,

2441
02:28:44.880 --> 02:28:47.780
it's, it's a terrible move. If you're playing a game,

2442
02:28:47.900 --> 02:28:51.290
it's a terrible foe first move because things only escalate.

2443
02:28:51.530 --> 02:28:54.580
They don't deescalate. No one says, wow, you beat the shit out of Andy. No,

2444
02:28:54.581 --> 02:28:57.530
this is a mystery, right? Like what the Hell is going on? Right?

2445
02:28:57.531 --> 02:28:58.090
What the hell is,

2446
02:28:58.090 --> 02:29:02.450
could you allowing people to wear masks and carry backpacks with weapons and

2447
02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:06.200
there's a natural human inclination when someone gets hit to jump in and hit

2448
02:29:06.201 --> 02:29:07.820
them too. So if you see it all the time,

2449
02:29:07.910 --> 02:29:11.930
watch worldstar go to Worldstar hip hop.com and watch someone gets hit.

2450
02:29:11.931 --> 02:29:13.550
A bunch of people just jump in and hit him.

2451
02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:16.970
It happens at truck stops and fucking high schools. It happens.

2452
02:29:16.971 --> 02:29:19.700
People get brain damage, people touching each other all the time.

2453
02:29:19.701 --> 02:29:23.480
People permanent injury. When you're seeing in Portland,

2454
02:29:23.540 --> 02:29:26.270
there was one of them where an old guy got hit in the head with a fucking

2455
02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:27.160
crowbar, right?

2456
02:29:27.160 --> 02:29:32.060
Some mass kid because the old guy apparently disagreed or they all disagree on

2457
02:29:32.061 --> 02:29:32.850
things they don't.

2458
02:29:32.850 --> 02:29:37.730
Someone's decided guesses that the old guy is not exactly as portrayed.

2459
02:29:38.590 --> 02:29:43.590
I believe that the old guy may have been there with a telescoping baton.

2460
02:29:45.770 --> 02:29:49.340
Oh, so he was hitting people. Let's take this. I think this is so worthwhile,

2461
02:29:49.341 --> 02:29:53.060
but like let's do it right, because I think this is so mysterious.

2462
02:29:53.060 --> 02:29:57.830
What the help or people doing supporting Andy know being beaten up on video,

2463
02:29:57.831 --> 02:30:00.830
so let's stay. Stay with him because that's the best,

2464
02:30:00.831 --> 02:30:05.120
clearest example of someone who's a tiny little gay man. He's tiny.

2465
02:30:05.150 --> 02:30:09.380
I mean he represents so many different maligned populations. Right?

2466
02:30:09.381 --> 02:30:12.320
He's pretty intersectional. Yes. He's Asian. He's an immigrant.

2467
02:30:12.321 --> 02:30:15.740
He's an immigrant. He's gay. I is he a Republican.

2468
02:30:16.910 --> 02:30:21.260
I thought he was left of center. I was told that he was a conservative, well,

2469
02:30:21.261 --> 02:30:25.140
I've been told I'm a fucking alt-right guy, so it's very confusing. All right.

2470
02:30:25.280 --> 02:30:30.230
He's also a diminutive in physical form as he's not dead,

2471
02:30:30.260 --> 02:30:33.620
he's not threatening physically. Right. And uh,

2472
02:30:33.740 --> 02:30:38.740
they've chosen this guy as an example and one of the more disturbing things for

2473
02:30:39.171 --> 02:30:42.200
how many people saw the video and we're justifying it saying things like,

2474
02:30:42.201 --> 02:30:47.090
get another hobby. These engines are the antifascist will not stand for,

2475
02:30:47.300 --> 02:30:49.790
you know, your, your, your bigotry and your hate.

2476
02:30:49.790 --> 02:30:52.730
Like what are you talking about? You think it's okay to punch this guy?

2477
02:30:53.210 --> 02:30:56.700
Like the fact that you guys all piled on and punched him. And this is so,

2478
02:30:57.710 --> 02:31:00.210
I've been thinking a lot about it. I have a model. I'm,

2479
02:31:00.410 --> 02:31:02.690
I'm happy to hear yours because there is a mystery.

2480
02:31:02.691 --> 02:31:06.440
Can we both agree to be at the beginning that you would imagine that that video

2481
02:31:06.441 --> 02:31:10.640
would have shocked people and to find so many people sort of excusing it is

2482
02:31:10.641 --> 02:31:14.080
really shocking. Well, it's given that he's also interested,

2483
02:31:14.081 --> 02:31:17.120
clearly intersectional. Yeah. You wouldn't predict this from first principles,

2484
02:31:17.210 --> 02:31:20.430
right? No, you wouldn't do, we looked it on paper. You definitely wouldn't.

2485
02:31:20.431 --> 02:31:23.520
Especially if if you allowed him to self identify as leftist center.

2486
02:31:23.580 --> 02:31:26.490
<v 2>Okay, so here's how the, I think the model goes. Okay.</v>

2487
02:31:26.680 --> 02:31:28.870
And unless you want to give yours first. No, go ahead. Alright.

2488
02:31:29.540 --> 02:31:30.373
<v 7>Okay.</v>

2489
02:31:31.340 --> 02:31:36.340
<v 2>The first thing that we have to understand is that there's a division,</v>

2490
02:31:37.160 --> 02:31:38.630
I want to lay this out super carefully.

2491
02:31:39.140 --> 02:31:42.320
The first division is between the,

2492
02:31:43.490 --> 02:31:46.310
what you're calling the loudest voices,

2493
02:31:46.460 --> 02:31:50.910
and I'm going to call the most courageous. Oh,

2494
02:31:51.020 --> 02:31:55.250
I don't want to call courageous. The most willing to accept loss.

2495
02:31:56.120 --> 02:31:57.950
The voices most willing to accept loss.

2496
02:31:58.550 --> 02:32:03.350
Most of the left does not want to be dragged to the extreme left.

2497
02:32:03.380 --> 02:32:05.990
And so you hear this thing about why are you focusing on a fringe?

2498
02:32:06.350 --> 02:32:09.860
And the answer is because the fringe is running the show, in my opinion.

2499
02:32:09.940 --> 02:32:12.220
<v 3>What do you mean by willing to accept loss?</v>

2500
02:32:12.890 --> 02:32:13.723
<v 7>Okay.</v>

2501
02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:18.170
<v 2>If you go into an antifa versus proud boys melee,</v>

2502
02:32:19.960 --> 02:32:24.850
you're willing, you accept that you may get clocked with a bike lock.

2503
02:32:24.960 --> 02:32:27.660
<v 3>I don't think that's correct, Tom. I don't think that's correct.</v>

2504
02:32:27.990 --> 02:32:31.770
I think you're dealing with people that have no concept of real violence,

2505
02:32:31.771 --> 02:32:34.800
no experience of real violence. We've seen it. If you've seen it, yes,

2506
02:32:35.010 --> 02:32:37.260
they're there. It's fucking cosplay. It's cosplay alert.

2507
02:32:37.410 --> 02:32:39.720
Have you seen the image of the guy who's a suspect?

2508
02:32:40.310 --> 02:32:42.360
It looks like he's never worked out a day in his fucking life.

2509
02:32:42.361 --> 02:32:43.680
Looks like he's never been outside,

2510
02:32:43.860 --> 02:32:47.970
and I think these people are playing a fucking game. We've agreed on it, yes.

2511
02:32:48.060 --> 02:32:50.970
<v 2>Okay, but you are willing,</v>

2512
02:32:51.660 --> 02:32:55.980
so you're think you're going to get into a Wiley coyote versus the road runner

2513
02:32:55.981 --> 02:32:58.670
kind of a thing where both of them always survive to the next car.

2514
02:32:58.810 --> 02:33:00.380
<v 3>Do you have no idea what they're doing if they ever,</v>

2515
02:33:00.430 --> 02:33:03.280
have you ever seen a fight between people that have no idea how to fight? Yes.

2516
02:33:03.340 --> 02:33:05.410
Yeah. Okay. We all have. I've been one of those. Okay.

2517
02:33:05.670 --> 02:33:08.140
That stuns me as a martial arts expert.

2518
02:33:08.290 --> 02:33:10.480
It stuns me that people are willing to participate in that.

2519
02:33:10.510 --> 02:33:13.840
It's like me not knowing how to get in a motorcycle and getting in a race.

2520
02:33:13.870 --> 02:33:17.200
I don't. I don't know how anyone's willing to do that,

2521
02:33:17.201 --> 02:33:19.840
but they're willing to do that and they're willing to do that because they're

2522
02:33:19.841 --> 02:33:23.920
delusional and they're supported in their delusion or perspective by the giant

2523
02:33:23.921 --> 02:33:26.770
numbers of them they all get to get and then then the wear masks,

2524
02:33:27.010 --> 02:33:31.570
which further emphasizes this illusion that they're a joke game. You look,

2525
02:33:32.980 --> 02:33:36.380
<v 2>assume that you are not even in a physical situation,</v>

2526
02:33:36.620 --> 02:33:40.400
you're willing to be very loud on social media about very simplistic

2527
02:33:40.401 --> 02:33:41.520
perspectives. Yes,

2528
02:33:41.750 --> 02:33:46.010
and you're willing to become a pariah at some level because are you though?

2529
02:33:46.011 --> 02:33:49.730
I think mostly your support. I need far more support.

2530
02:33:50.600 --> 02:33:51.980
I'm not necessarily,

2531
02:33:52.430 --> 02:33:56.390
you are going to trigger so many times on this explanation that I probably just

2532
02:33:56.391 --> 02:34:00.050
need a little place in the table to start building this up and then you can tear

2533
02:34:00.051 --> 02:34:03.090
it to the hell. Okay. Okay. The first belief is,

2534
02:34:03.091 --> 02:34:06.920
is that the belief that I have is that the fringes are much more running the

2535
02:34:06.921 --> 02:34:11.630
show than the people who claim that this is a small number of people believe

2536
02:34:12.380 --> 02:34:16.940
that the fringes are scary, fringes are willing to go places. The rest of us,

2537
02:34:17.320 --> 02:34:18.010
I agree with you

2538
02:34:18.010 --> 02:34:20.200
<v 4>on both sides left and right, left and right.</v>

2539
02:34:20.740 --> 02:34:25.480
So I spend a lot of time focused on the fringes because the fringes have become

2540
02:34:25.481 --> 02:34:27.880
terrifying and the middle has become cowardly.

2541
02:34:28.860 --> 02:34:30.850
And the whole principle of about the whole idea,

2542
02:34:30.851 --> 02:34:35.440
I believe thing was about creating a non cowardly

2543
02:34:36.970 --> 02:34:41.080
core that could actually potentially hold the center.

2544
02:34:42.550 --> 02:34:45.730
Um, because people are actually fairly courageous. Like you would have to say,

2545
02:34:45.731 --> 02:34:50.260
my brother is fairly courageous. Ben Shapiro, Andy, no, Sam Harris.

2546
02:34:50.261 --> 02:34:52.930
These are people who have stood up to death threats. You know, I,

2547
02:34:52.931 --> 02:34:57.280
I have a guy who was threatening me every day of my life. Uh, you know,

2548
02:34:57.281 --> 02:34:59.740
coming through the Internet and my family,

2549
02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:02.740
you have to have some courage in order to be part of this thing.

2550
02:35:02.770 --> 02:35:05.170
And that's more part of my irritation when people come after it.

2551
02:35:06.100 --> 02:35:11.100
So there is a cowardly center and a very terrifying fringe and the fringe is

2552
02:35:13.511 --> 02:35:15.910
going around the whole thing right, left and right.

2553
02:35:18.250 --> 02:35:21.520
The next thing is that people are secretly,

2554
02:35:21.940 --> 02:35:24.250
weirdly sympathetic, but they're violent.

2555
02:35:24.340 --> 02:35:29.340
The violent fringe to their extreme rather than making common cause across the

2556
02:35:29.411 --> 02:35:31.450
center. So for example,

2557
02:35:32.140 --> 02:35:37.140
you imagine that you run a laundromat and you're being visited by a member of

2558
02:35:37.511 --> 02:35:42.100
organized crime every week and he comes into your laundromat and he kind of

2559
02:35:42.910 --> 02:35:44.710
plays with your stuff and he says,

2560
02:35:44.870 --> 02:35:47.200
it'd be shame if anything happened to your business and he shakes you down.

2561
02:35:48.100 --> 02:35:50.590
Start Saying, Oh, you know, I noticed that you have a daughter.

2562
02:35:50.591 --> 02:35:53.950
I would love to date her. Perhaps. Perhaps we'll go out some time,

2563
02:35:54.520 --> 02:35:58.270
you hate this guy. And then some sort of violent village,

2564
02:35:58.300 --> 02:36:02.170
vigilante element that's operating extra judicially after you've gone to the

2565
02:36:02.171 --> 02:36:06.490
police over and over again breaks this guy's kneecaps.

2566
02:36:08.220 --> 02:36:08.620
Right?

2567
02:36:08.620 --> 02:36:12.790
You're weirdly sympathetic with the vigilante because you're being terrified by

2568
02:36:12.791 --> 02:36:14.770
a group that is not being taken care of.

2569
02:36:16.870 --> 02:36:21.870
I think that this is in part why some elements of the left that are should be

2570
02:36:22.181 --> 02:36:24.970
more responsible, that have institutional positions,

2571
02:36:24.971 --> 02:36:29.680
that have platforms that they can broadcast are weirdly sympathetic to Antifa

2572
02:36:30.370 --> 02:36:34.870
and why country club Republicans are weirdly sympathetic to some of these far

2573
02:36:34.871 --> 02:36:39.871
right groups is that they view them as this is the dangerous group that's kind

2574
02:36:41.301 --> 02:36:43.930
of taken care of the problem that I can't stand up to.

2575
02:36:44.590 --> 02:36:46.240
So you've got this bizarre,

2576
02:36:46.450 --> 02:36:51.450
cowardly sympathy from the center who won't actually stand up and say,

2577
02:36:51.611 --> 02:36:56.440
I have more in common with a country club Republican. Like in my case,

2578
02:36:56.441 --> 02:36:58.990
I view myself as a progressive or at least a liberal.

2579
02:36:59.800 --> 02:37:04.360
I have more in common with a country club Republican than somebody who's got a

2580
02:37:04.361 --> 02:37:08.560
bike lock who's looking for trouble in a street demonstration trying to smash up

2581
02:37:08.561 --> 02:37:10.060
a Starbucks. Right.

2582
02:37:10.810 --> 02:37:14.140
I don't want the help from my left.

2583
02:37:15.500 --> 02:37:16.333
Now the,

2584
02:37:16.700 --> 02:37:20.660
the group that wants to play this out using these sort of proxy groups to handle

2585
02:37:20.720 --> 02:37:24.970
the problems. It's saying, look,

2586
02:37:25.420 --> 02:37:25.930
we're going to,

2587
02:37:25.930 --> 02:37:29.200
we're going to sound an air horn before one of these things so that all

2588
02:37:29.230 --> 02:37:33.460
reasonable people can get the hell out of the way. And if you don't respond,

2589
02:37:33.490 --> 02:37:36.520
then you're collateral damage and that's on you. That's how they see this.

2590
02:37:37.300 --> 02:37:38.890
I think that's fair. So in other words,

2591
02:37:38.891 --> 02:37:42.280
I think Andy No is the guy who doesn't listen to the air horn.

2592
02:37:42.340 --> 02:37:45.790
Bret Weinstein doesn't listen to the Air Horn, Jordan, Jordan Peterson,

2593
02:37:45.820 --> 02:37:50.740
Sam Harris, don't listen to the air horn. Yeah.

2594
02:37:51.060 --> 02:37:54.600
I think that's very accurate in your description of these fringe people doing

2595
02:37:54.601 --> 02:37:59.601
the work of the people that are more reasonable but are happy to have these bad

2596
02:38:01.351 --> 02:38:05.580
people do do their work to fight this battle for them because they think that

2597
02:38:05.581 --> 02:38:06.810
ultimately it's for good. Yeah.

2598
02:38:06.811 --> 02:38:10.750
I need my organized crime group to get rid of your organized. Yes. Right. Yeah.

2599
02:38:10.770 --> 02:38:13.800
And so the idea is that the law and order people are like,

2600
02:38:13.890 --> 02:38:16.740
I really don't want anybody's organized crime group and I'm going to actually

2601
02:38:16.741 --> 02:38:19.500
stand up to the mob and I'm actually not going to pay you your God damn

2602
02:38:19.501 --> 02:38:22.830
protection money because I'm going to own a laundromat and this is the United

2603
02:38:22.830 --> 02:38:27.810
States of American fuck off. That's, that's the view that I represent. Yeah.

2604
02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:32.770
I don't want, I don't thank you Auntie, if I don't need your help. Yeah.

2605
02:38:32.800 --> 02:38:35.530
You know what? I actually am much more afraid of the far right.

2606
02:38:35.531 --> 02:38:39.220
And the reason I concentrate my negative energy on the far left is what are you

2607
02:38:39.221 --> 02:38:42.160
trying to do? You're trying to get the genie out of the bottle on the far right.

2608
02:38:42.370 --> 02:38:44.890
That is the danger. Yeah. You want to see more Tiki torches.

2609
02:38:45.310 --> 02:38:47.650
It's not Tiki torches too. You need to worry about,

2610
02:38:47.651 --> 02:38:52.040
it's armed people who come and they know that I'm bringing bike [inaudible].

2611
02:38:52.230 --> 02:38:57.130
We're pushing ordinary human beings to the extremes. Yeah. Right.

2612
02:38:57.190 --> 02:38:58.610
And the thing that I get is,

2613
02:38:58.611 --> 02:39:01.420
is that like I believe that the Republican Party in our desk,

2614
02:39:01.450 --> 02:39:02.920
I never get a chance to say this stuff.

2615
02:39:05.980 --> 02:39:10.270
I have never gotten along with the Republican Party. I just don't like it.

2616
02:39:10.630 --> 02:39:13.600
I view it as the thing that wants to exclude me from the country clubs.

2617
02:39:13.601 --> 02:39:14.920
I have an older model.

2618
02:39:15.520 --> 02:39:19.300
They're the group that wanted to put in condo developments in Yosemite valley

2619
02:39:20.030 --> 02:39:22.600
because they couldn't figure out why we would want to preserve the national

2620
02:39:22.601 --> 02:39:25.930
parks. They were the ones that laughed about the clubbing, the baby seals.

2621
02:39:26.080 --> 02:39:30.190
Ha ha ha. I just always had this attitude, fuck these people, right?

2622
02:39:30.220 --> 02:39:33.280
This is mine. This is my emotional cadence.

2623
02:39:34.480 --> 02:39:37.440
And we always had this thing where the Democrats were this,

2624
02:39:37.730 --> 02:39:39.700
we had most of the smart people.

2625
02:39:40.570 --> 02:39:43.120
And so in a tiny fraction of time,

2626
02:39:43.210 --> 02:39:48.040
we have seen this giant evaporation of intelligence, uh, if not

2627
02:39:50.220 --> 02:39:52.860
actually through a lack of courage.

2628
02:39:53.550 --> 02:39:57.390
The people who represent responsible left wing thinking,

2629
02:39:57.570 --> 02:40:00.750
who believe in structural oppression but don't believe in the extent claimed,

2630
02:40:01.020 --> 02:40:03.420
you know, who want to keep making progress,

2631
02:40:03.421 --> 02:40:08.370
who want to make sure that traditionally marginalized groups are taken care of,

2632
02:40:08.371 --> 02:40:13.371
that we take our responsibilities but not our guilt as the reason for trying to

2633
02:40:13.681 --> 02:40:17.340
make a better world. I'm not paying reparations for slavery.

2634
02:40:18.390 --> 02:40:23.140
I mean, my family came over here and like what the 19 teens or twenties be,

2635
02:40:23.460 --> 02:40:23.670
you know,

2636
02:40:23.670 --> 02:40:27.150
we came from pogroms is anybody can be paying Jews for the pogroms that,

2637
02:40:27.180 --> 02:40:29.490
you know, how am I going to get getting Ukrainian reparations?

2638
02:40:29.491 --> 02:40:34.320
Let's not be ridiculous. Why do we want civil war? Do we just want to open up,

2639
02:40:34.380 --> 02:40:37.200
tear off every bandaid for the purpose of, uh, you know,

2640
02:40:37.201 --> 02:40:40.160
trying to make everybody, um,

2641
02:40:40.740 --> 02:40:42.570
as uncomfortable in their skin as possible.

2642
02:40:42.780 --> 02:40:47.780
What we have is a situation in which we don't have courageous people willing to

2643
02:40:49.861 --> 02:40:52.020
fight for what works.

2644
02:40:52.830 --> 02:40:55.380
We have a tiny number of people who are animated by this.

2645
02:40:55.381 --> 02:40:59.040
The reason I'm animated by this is that I'm trying to keep the pipeline open for

2646
02:40:59.041 --> 02:41:03.810
science. It's really what happened to my brother, um,

2647
02:41:05.160 --> 02:41:06.540
before it ever happened to him.

2648
02:41:06.750 --> 02:41:09.930
My brother and I were in this discussion about what are we going to do to make

2649
02:41:09.931 --> 02:41:13.320
sure that there's always a place to do biology, to do mathematics,

2650
02:41:13.710 --> 02:41:17.400
to be able to way, um, you know,

2651
02:41:17.460 --> 02:41:18.780
competing claims.

2652
02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:24.680
And when you start politicizing everything and you choose activism over-thought

2653
02:41:26.490 --> 02:41:29.130
and reason and civility and commity,

2654
02:41:30.180 --> 02:41:34.320
you can sign yourself to becoming, uh, a less great nation and uh,

2655
02:41:34.920 --> 02:41:36.510
you're no longer able to lead.

2656
02:41:36.780 --> 02:41:41.780
You can't build a world on angry activism that's trying to go back to a

2657
02:41:42.570 --> 02:41:46.920
Lillywhite nation that will never happen and you can't enforce like equality of

2658
02:41:46.921 --> 02:41:48.510
outcome. We don't even want that.

2659
02:41:49.740 --> 02:41:54.740
People who work their ass off deserved some of the pleasures of working your ass

2660
02:41:54.811 --> 02:41:57.300
off. And I don't always want to work my ass off. And I, you know,

2661
02:41:57.330 --> 02:41:58.350
Jackie Chan is the one,

2662
02:41:58.351 --> 02:42:02.100
I always look at that blooper reel at the end of every Jackie Chan film tells me

2663
02:42:02.101 --> 02:42:06.840
he deserves his money. I'm never going to do that to my body ever.

2664
02:42:07.620 --> 02:42:09.780
I don't want an equality of outcome with Jackie Chan.

2665
02:42:09.781 --> 02:42:13.140
If I make some little film and this guy's risks his life for every scene,

2666
02:42:13.890 --> 02:42:14.760
it's insane.

2667
02:42:15.990 --> 02:42:20.990
We need to create a world in which people are excited and animated about keeping

2668
02:42:21.901 --> 02:42:25.680
the pipeline of decent thought,

2669
02:42:26.520 --> 02:42:28.590
compassionate thought, openhearted thought,

2670
02:42:29.490 --> 02:42:34.490
and rigorous and unforgiving thought both on the table at all times and not

2671
02:42:36.780 --> 02:42:38.040
adulterating one to serve the other.

2672
02:42:40.960 --> 02:42:44.860
I don't want to see science abuse to oppress anybody and I don't want to see

2673
02:42:44.861 --> 02:42:49.861
somebody's dime store concept of Utopia infecting our ability to make sense of

2674
02:42:50.111 --> 02:42:55.050
the world. Those are, those are twin, you know,

2675
02:42:55.100 --> 02:42:58.510
twin directives. And this is, this is what I'm excited about.

2676
02:42:58.511 --> 02:43:02.680
We need to get the world excited about curing disease.

2677
02:43:02.681 --> 02:43:07.681
We need to get the world excited about cross pollination of ideas between

2678
02:43:07.691 --> 02:43:08.411
different groups.

2679
02:43:08.411 --> 02:43:12.910
We need to get the world excited about every that is sort of marginalized

2680
02:43:14.140 --> 02:43:17.500
contains neurons that we are not accessing.

2681
02:43:18.850 --> 02:43:20.290
Right? And so, you know, for example,

2682
02:43:20.320 --> 02:43:24.400
Asian females make up about a quarter of the world's population and very few of

2683
02:43:24.401 --> 02:43:25.690
the world's Nobel prizes.

2684
02:43:26.380 --> 02:43:31.380
We should be getting greedy about how do we get those Asian female brains into,

2685
02:43:33.460 --> 02:43:38.440
into our stem labs so that we can have the fruits of, of their discoveries.

2686
02:43:38.890 --> 02:43:40.450
People can't hear this because they've,

2687
02:43:40.660 --> 02:43:45.660
they've settled on very cheap versions of progress as time to get back to real

2688
02:43:46.601 --> 02:43:49.780
progress, not fake progress. How do we do that?

2689
02:43:49.810 --> 02:43:54.430
I agree with everything you just said, but how do we do that? Honestly,

2690
02:43:55.630 --> 02:43:59.950
um, this is my third time on perhaps the biggest podcast in, in the world.

2691
02:44:00.220 --> 02:44:02.710
I don't know. Maybe. Maybe that's giving you a little bit too much.

2692
02:44:02.950 --> 02:44:05.590
Credit's not very far off. We're doing that.

2693
02:44:05.680 --> 02:44:09.130
We're trying to stand up and if people respond and you know,

2694
02:44:09.131 --> 02:44:11.200
you've given me courage to start a podcast.

2695
02:44:11.270 --> 02:44:13.270
I gotta tell you I did not want to do this.

2696
02:44:13.530 --> 02:44:16.570
My brought my producer Jesse Michael's here.

2697
02:44:16.840 --> 02:44:20.680
I was a pain in the ass to this guy. I did not return his phone calls.

2698
02:44:20.681 --> 02:44:24.220
He tried to get me to sign contracts. I wouldn't look at them. Um,

2699
02:44:24.280 --> 02:44:28.390
I've started with this turnkey podcast company called cast media.

2700
02:44:28.540 --> 02:44:32.740
They put up with me for like eight or nine months where I dragged my heels. Uh,

2701
02:44:32.830 --> 02:44:36.130
I don't want to be famous. I don't want to be, well, no, I like,

2702
02:44:36.400 --> 02:44:41.170
I know while I'm sort of loud. Well, it's t look. So this is the crazy thing.

2703
02:44:41.171 --> 02:44:44.810
You want to get really nuts. Yes. It's time to leave. Time to leave. What?

2704
02:44:44.920 --> 02:44:49.420
This planet. Oh boy. Listen, we can leave this plant.

2705
02:44:49.421 --> 02:44:53.830
I got something right here. No, no, no. Take it to another planet right now.

2706
02:44:53.860 --> 02:44:58.790
He's joking. Federal agents. Let me,

2707
02:44:58.810 --> 02:45:01.870
let me give you my argument. Where are we going? Well,

2708
02:45:01.930 --> 02:45:04.240
we don't know that we can leave this planet. I love this planet.

2709
02:45:04.570 --> 02:45:07.870
I love this plan. I have a good time here. This is my favorite planet. Mine too.

2710
02:45:07.930 --> 02:45:10.560
I know. But here's the real reason.

2711
02:45:12.580 --> 02:45:16.720
We started a clock around 1953,

2712
02:45:17.140 --> 02:45:21.260
which is when we had the explosion at Bikini and the,

2713
02:45:21.261 --> 02:45:24.240
the first hydrogen bomb. And um,

2714
02:45:25.360 --> 02:45:30.010
when we figured out the double helix, and I call this the twin nuclei problem,

2715
02:45:30.011 --> 02:45:33.220
and it began in 1953, 1953, we started a clock.

2716
02:45:33.221 --> 02:45:34.780
It was also the height of the McCarthy era.

2717
02:45:36.580 --> 02:45:40.360
We do not have the wisdom to be able to fuse nuclei.

2718
02:45:40.850 --> 02:45:43.450
We don't have the wisdom to be able to investigate the cell.

2719
02:45:43.570 --> 02:45:44.590
It's too much power.

2720
02:45:46.450 --> 02:45:50.170
So our wisdom may have increased slightly. Maybe it didn't.

2721
02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:52.540
I don't know that our power is now godly.

2722
02:45:52.750 --> 02:45:57.040
So our biological intelligence,

2723
02:45:57.070 --> 02:46:01.430
what our minds are capable of has not it,

2724
02:46:02.020 --> 02:46:07.020
it's been surpassed by our intellectual achievements in terms of our,

2725
02:46:08.060 --> 02:46:12.500
our, our technological innovations, these things which while complicated,

2726
02:46:14.620 --> 02:46:15.453
<v 5>um,</v>

2727
02:46:17.070 --> 02:46:19.430
<v 4>succumb to our intellects, right? Right.</v>

2728
02:46:19.550 --> 02:46:22.200
Like they're much simpler than we ever imagined.

2729
02:46:22.950 --> 02:46:27.660
To be able to create something that normally happens in the sun on an island in

2730
02:46:27.661 --> 02:46:32.160
the Pacific, or to be able to rewrite a cell the way Craig venter did,

2731
02:46:32.580 --> 02:46:34.080
you know, synthetic biology,

2732
02:46:35.190 --> 02:46:38.670
we are now gods, but for the wisdom,

2733
02:46:40.800 --> 02:46:44.370
and there's a great quote, we are now God's,

2734
02:46:44.371 --> 02:46:49.371
but for the wisdom should be like meme pictures can picture you right now.

2735
02:46:50.011 --> 02:46:54.810
God, let's keep to the ones right now. I know. Let's not focus.

2736
02:46:54.870 --> 02:46:55.950
Okay. Sorry. Okay.

2737
02:46:56.940 --> 02:47:01.940
So that started this clock and the world's most serious human beings should be

2738
02:47:03.571 --> 02:47:05.460
working on the twin nuclei problem.

2739
02:47:05.461 --> 02:47:08.970
What do we do with new godlike powers given our history of conflict,

2740
02:47:09.540 --> 02:47:13.920
our history of envy, our history of madness, right?

2741
02:47:13.921 --> 02:47:16.140
Because we succumb regularly. We are, you know,

2742
02:47:16.620 --> 02:47:20.520
I was born 20 years after the end of World War II and we all know what really

2743
02:47:20.521 --> 02:47:22.650
happened there. I mean, we're nuts.

2744
02:47:23.340 --> 02:47:27.120
We're absolutely not capable of this level of responsibility.

2745
02:47:28.080 --> 02:47:29.640
And so the question that we have is,

2746
02:47:29.700 --> 02:47:33.960
do we believe that we have a longterm solution in terms of increasing our

2747
02:47:33.961 --> 02:47:36.600
wisdom? We should definitely try it.

2748
02:47:36.601 --> 02:47:40.350
Everybody believes that should work on that problem. But,

2749
02:47:42.150 --> 02:47:44.760
um, if we don't think that we have the wisdom to live like this,

2750
02:47:45.750 --> 02:47:48.690
we don't know how much time we have left, but it's probably not hundreds.

2751
02:47:48.790 --> 02:47:52.560
It's probably maybe a few hundred years tops because sooner or later you're

2752
02:47:52.690 --> 02:47:57.450
going to have Putin like Trump, like people. I mean,

2753
02:47:57.451 --> 02:48:01.500
I'm sorry. I would have a very deep antipathy towards Donald Trump. Um,

2754
02:48:03.920 --> 02:48:08.630
he's not temperamentally fit to have the secrets of theoretical physics at his

2755
02:48:08.631 --> 02:48:09.464
fingertips.

2756
02:48:10.360 --> 02:48:15.360
It just isn't and it's imperative to me that he not be elected in 2020 and that

2757
02:48:17.151 --> 02:48:21.440
the Democratic Party wake up and get rid of its crazy fringe so that we can buy

2758
02:48:21.441 --> 02:48:24.530
some time and it's nice if Elon thinks we can go to Mars,

2759
02:48:25.130 --> 02:48:29.390
maybe that will allow a small number of us to diversify in case we do something

2760
02:48:29.391 --> 02:48:30.440
really dumbed at the planet.

2761
02:48:31.550 --> 02:48:34.880
But if human beings are to continue and we are to continue evolving,

2762
02:48:34.881 --> 02:48:38.810
we need to spread out and there are three rocks that are inhabitable.

2763
02:48:38.840 --> 02:48:39.441
There's the earth,

2764
02:48:39.441 --> 02:48:44.210
there's the moon and there's Mars and the moon has nothing in there.

2765
02:48:44.570 --> 02:48:46.820
Mars is pretty uninteresting to be in blunt.

2766
02:48:46.821 --> 02:48:49.610
I know that it's beautiful that we send back these pictures and we've got this

2767
02:48:49.611 --> 02:48:53.090
one gorgeous planet that we are clearly not smart enough to Stuart.

2768
02:48:53.270 --> 02:48:55.310
We're still having idiotic climate change debates.

2769
02:48:56.210 --> 02:48:59.060
I mean even if even if climate science is somewhat junk of vide,

2770
02:49:00.140 --> 02:49:03.080
we should still be taking climate super seriously because we don't know what

2771
02:49:03.081 --> 02:49:03.441
we're doing.

2772
02:49:03.441 --> 02:49:07.190
It's such a complicated nonlinear system and we're not even capable of focusing,

2773
02:49:07.230 --> 02:49:11.190
you know, like two seconds later I'll be watching the Kardashians for sure.

2774
02:49:12.300 --> 02:49:14.850
So what is the answer? Well, in my opinion,

2775
02:49:15.900 --> 02:49:19.350
we got to increase the number of possible places we can go beyond three

2776
02:49:21.370 --> 02:49:23.940
to say nothing of space stations because that's not realistic. Now,

2777
02:49:23.980 --> 02:49:25.570
none of these things make sense.

2778
02:49:26.260 --> 02:49:30.280
So the first place that you have to get to is we're really deeply screwed and

2779
02:49:30.281 --> 02:49:34.510
not because of apocalyptic cult like reasons just because of science,

2780
02:49:35.620 --> 02:49:37.030
just because of 1953.

2781
02:49:39.370 --> 02:49:43.870
So the only opportunity is if we can break the Einsteinian speed limit so far as

2782
02:49:43.871 --> 02:49:48.250
I know, or we can upload into silicon or we can reboot from tardigrades.

2783
02:49:48.251 --> 02:49:49.600
Like none of these answers are good.

2784
02:49:52.270 --> 02:49:53.103
<v 5>So</v>

2785
02:49:54.420 --> 02:49:58.590
<v 4>what I've been toying with since I was 19 was</v>

2786
02:50:00.120 --> 02:50:01.950
what is the theory beyond Einstein?

2787
02:50:03.870 --> 02:50:08.130
And that's the thing that I've been most uncomfortable talking about. Um,

2788
02:50:08.190 --> 02:50:09.630
although I've been talking about it more,

2789
02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:14.720
I gave these lectures in 2013 and in May of 2013 in Oxford and I was appalled by

2790
02:50:15.811 --> 02:50:19.800
the way in which the world's physics community responded. I mean,

2791
02:50:19.801 --> 02:50:23.550
I was very scared. I'm not a physicist. Um,

2792
02:50:24.100 --> 02:50:25.080
know I don't claim to be,

2793
02:50:26.160 --> 02:50:31.160
but I felt like I tried to present what I hoped was a path forward given that

2794
02:50:31.681 --> 02:50:36.360
the field was completely stalled out. And this is it.

2795
02:50:36.361 --> 02:50:39.330
Physics and biology led us into the valley of death

2796
02:50:40.830 --> 02:50:45.570
and it's now time to try to get out and people go ahead.

2797
02:50:45.780 --> 02:50:46.613
No, please.

2798
02:50:47.460 --> 02:50:52.140
So what is my responsibility in terms of the portal?

2799
02:50:54.240 --> 02:50:55.073
<v 5>Um,</v>

2800
02:50:55.930 --> 02:51:00.930
<v 4>what I'm going to try to do with this podcast is gained the courage to share</v>

2801
02:51:01.450 --> 02:51:04.510
whatever ideas I've had, um,

2802
02:51:05.470 --> 02:51:08.320
about breaking the speed limit

2803
02:51:09.970 --> 02:51:11.290
in the form of,

2804
02:51:11.890 --> 02:51:16.720
I don't think I have the wisdom to figure out what it means,

2805
02:51:16.930 --> 02:51:21.930
but at least I have a hope of trying to write the fundamental rules to figure

2806
02:51:24.071 --> 02:51:27.190
out our source code. And that was that, that was the plan,

2807
02:51:27.220 --> 02:51:31.300
which is what is this place? What is the source code for reality?

2808
02:51:33.310 --> 02:51:34.870
Now, what was the response?

2809
02:51:35.370 --> 02:51:39.010
Did the physics to the physicists from the physicist that you found Pauling?

2810
02:51:39.130 --> 02:51:43.390
Well, there were two articles that appeared in the Guardian,

2811
02:51:43.960 --> 02:51:47.940
a newspaper or a website that, um,

2812
02:51:48.130 --> 02:51:53.130
talked breathlessly about what I had done or what I might've done to call

2813
02:51:53.681 --> 02:51:55.300
attention to the lectures that I was giving.

2814
02:51:55.301 --> 02:52:00.100
So these were the special ceremony lectures by Richard Dawkins successor,

2815
02:52:01.240 --> 02:52:02.073
Marcus de Sautoy,

2816
02:52:02.530 --> 02:52:07.530
who is a colleague of mine from way back who found me in New York City,

2817
02:52:07.990 --> 02:52:12.910
I think in 2011, 2012 or something like that. Working on

2818
02:52:14.440 --> 02:52:16.180
this theory, I called geometric unity

2819
02:52:17.830 --> 02:52:20.470
and I was very uncomfortable.

2820
02:52:20.500 --> 02:52:23.770
I hadn't really told anybody that I was working on this theory for all these

2821
02:52:23.770 --> 02:52:25.360
years because it's a crazy, you know,

2822
02:52:25.390 --> 02:52:28.930
there's certain stories that you find in theoretical physics,

2823
02:52:29.380 --> 02:52:33.580
which is kind of the precursor to madness where you know,

2824
02:52:33.581 --> 02:52:36.350
somebody thinks that they've solved, uh,

2825
02:52:36.400 --> 02:52:38.590
some big problem and they're working in secret, you know,

2826
02:52:38.650 --> 02:52:42.040
the sort of what happened with Andrew Weil's and Fermat's last theorem,

2827
02:52:42.070 --> 02:52:46.150
which was a really interesting story because his first proof of Fermat's last

2828
02:52:46.151 --> 02:52:47.890
theorem I think was unfixable.

2829
02:52:48.460 --> 02:52:52.180
So he announced a proof that he had solved like this most famous problem in

2830
02:52:52.181 --> 02:52:54.340
mathematics and he didn't have it proof.

2831
02:52:55.060 --> 02:52:59.500
And then bizarrely he was under such pressure that he found another proof and

2832
02:52:59.501 --> 02:53:02.410
actually pulled it off. So it's like, you know, hats off to him.

2833
02:53:02.411 --> 02:53:03.221
It's one of the crazy story,

2834
02:53:03.221 --> 02:53:06.460
but he was working in secret for seven years and nobody knew what he was doing.

2835
02:53:08.140 --> 02:53:09.850
So sometimes these stories work out.

2836
02:53:09.851 --> 02:53:13.960
But he was a professor at Princeton and very highly regarded and he had sort of

2837
02:53:14.360 --> 02:53:19.360
husband had seven years worth of work to pretend that he was releasing papers

2838
02:53:19.570 --> 02:53:22.330
when he was actually secretly doing this thing that would have made him a mad

2839
02:53:22.331 --> 02:53:23.620
man in some sense.

2840
02:53:25.450 --> 02:53:30.010
And so this is what I was trying to do is I was not able to work on these issues

2841
02:53:30.010 --> 02:53:34.090
, uh, in the string theory community because the strength theory community was

2842
02:53:34.091 --> 02:53:38.740
possessed of this belief that they had found the answer back in the 80s in 1984

2843
02:53:38.741 --> 02:53:40.480
they had what they thought was a revolution.

2844
02:53:41.200 --> 02:53:44.290
And the math community doesn't think in these terms.

2845
02:53:44.350 --> 02:53:48.640
Like both of these are very conservative communities historically and very

2846
02:53:48.641 --> 02:53:52.960
focused on following the leadership of the top people unless there's a

2847
02:53:52.961 --> 02:53:53.794
revolution.

2848
02:53:54.580 --> 02:53:59.200
And so I started working on a different idea to unify the two branches of

2849
02:53:59.201 --> 02:54:01.880
physics that appear to be incompatible.

2850
02:54:01.900 --> 02:54:05.410
That was different than the string theory idea in different than the loop

2851
02:54:05.411 --> 02:54:08.800
quantum gravity idea or any of the hazard of then your main motivation was to do

2852
02:54:08.801 --> 02:54:12.790
this, to try to figure out a more advanced version of space travel. Well,

2853
02:54:12.850 --> 02:54:16.930
it wasn't space travel. It was we need the source code like it's,

2854
02:54:17.650 --> 02:54:21.220
it might be safer to go further once you've unlocked,

2855
02:54:21.970 --> 02:54:23.620
once you've unlocked nuclear fusion,

2856
02:54:24.610 --> 02:54:26.590
you're pretty much just as screwed as you need to be.

2857
02:54:28.240 --> 02:54:32.350
So then the issue is, okay, we know that we're pretty,

2858
02:54:32.351 --> 02:54:37.351
I'm pretty sure that Einstein's theory is not final because you get these

2859
02:54:38.711 --> 02:54:42.700
singularities, which I don't associate with ultimate equations.

2860
02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:47.500
So the black hole singularity called the Schwartz chills singularity or the

2861
02:54:47.501 --> 02:54:51.730
initial singularity that we associate with the big bang, um,

2862
02:54:52.050 --> 02:54:57.050
and like the Friedman Robertson Walker space times are signs to me that these

2863
02:54:57.251 --> 02:54:58.360
equations are incomplete.

2864
02:54:58.360 --> 02:55:02.860
But the big problem with Einstein is that Einstein's work was so fundamental

2865
02:55:03.920 --> 02:55:08.420
that it's like you can't get in under the ground floor of Einstein.

2866
02:55:09.320 --> 02:55:12.380
You begin a physics seminar and you're already immediately in his world,

2867
02:55:12.381 --> 02:55:17.210
you say, let x be a space time manifold. Boom, you're already in in relativity.

2868
02:55:17.690 --> 02:55:22.690
So it's almost impossible to figure out a way to get in at a deeper level of

2869
02:55:23.421 --> 02:55:25.100
physics than Einstein's theory.

2870
02:55:26.200 --> 02:55:29.330
And we know that we have to recover Einstein's theory because that's been proven

2871
02:55:29.330 --> 02:55:32.980
, uh, you know, to work in all sorts of situations.

2872
02:55:33.100 --> 02:55:36.200
And the same thing with quantum field theory, which is why I talked about,

2873
02:55:36.230 --> 02:55:39.110
you know, the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron.

2874
02:55:40.310 --> 02:55:45.310
So my idea was that only since the 1970s have we known that particle theory was

2875
02:55:46.581 --> 02:55:50.240
based on geometry. We knew that Einstein's theory,

2876
02:55:50.241 --> 02:55:52.370
I thought you used geometry to develop his theory.

2877
02:55:52.370 --> 02:55:56.390
It was the language of relativity called Romani and geometry.

2878
02:55:56.990 --> 02:55:58.490
But many years later,

2879
02:55:58.491 --> 02:56:02.510
we found out that bores sort of quantum and plunks quantum,

2880
02:56:02.540 --> 02:56:06.200
and Einstein's upon them as well, was based on a different geometry of this guy.

2881
02:56:06.890 --> 02:56:11.240
Charles Eris man was an Alsatian geometer, uh, who'd worked with carton.

2882
02:56:12.470 --> 02:56:17.470
And that geometry was figured out at Stony Brook in New York by Jim Simons,

2883
02:56:20.271 --> 02:56:25.271
who became the world's greatest hedge fund manager and CNN Yang who was arguably

2884
02:56:25.940 --> 02:56:28.940
number one or number two greatest living theoretical physicist.

2885
02:56:28.941 --> 02:56:29.780
He's now in his nineties.

2886
02:56:30.860 --> 02:56:34.640
And they figured out that the secret language of particle theory was also

2887
02:56:34.641 --> 02:56:36.290
geometry, but a different geometry.

2888
02:56:37.070 --> 02:56:41.960
And so geometric unity is simply the idea that it's not a fight between Einstein

2889
02:56:41.961 --> 02:56:45.830
and Bohr. It's the two parents

2890
02:56:48.200 --> 02:56:50.940
remonde on who's I work, uh,

2891
02:56:50.990 --> 02:56:55.990
Einstein based relativity and Charles Eris man with this gauge theoretic stuff

2892
02:56:56.211 --> 02:56:59.300
that we did in the time before this, uh,

2893
02:56:59.330 --> 02:57:03.440
which in fact empowers a particle theory.

2894
02:57:05.420 --> 02:57:10.280
And so when do those two geometries unify two different geometric theories.

2895
02:57:10.310 --> 02:57:14.330
And I've found that in general, they don't unify in a way that you want.

2896
02:57:14.331 --> 02:57:19.331
You don't have the ability to do Einsteinian tensor analysis where you compress

2897
02:57:19.761 --> 02:57:23.960
something called the Remonde curvature tensor and the gauge stuff where you do

2898
02:57:23.961 --> 02:57:28.961
this gauge symmetry that we were talking about because gauge symmetry ruins the

2899
02:57:29.301 --> 02:57:32.630
ability to compress the Einstein tensor. Nevermind what that means.

2900
02:57:33.500 --> 02:57:35.930
But in one or two rare circumstances,

2901
02:57:35.931 --> 02:57:40.370
you can actually combine the two geometries. And that's where I think we are.

2902
02:57:41.420 --> 02:57:46.160
And so partially what the purpose of the portal podcast is, is to use,

2903
02:57:47.510 --> 02:57:50.690
um, you know, I'll just sort of tear the mask off a little bit.

2904
02:57:51.770 --> 02:57:55.280
We've been talking about lots of interesting things about social justice,

2905
02:57:55.310 --> 02:57:57.770
about um, mathematics,

2906
02:57:57.771 --> 02:58:02.771
about wonder about psychedelics and trying to be decent human beings to each

2907
02:58:03.751 --> 02:58:04.980
other and to set an example.

2908
02:58:04.980 --> 02:58:07.530
And I think it's been partially a success and partially a failure.

2909
02:58:09.450 --> 02:58:14.450
But what I'm trying to do is to gain the courage to talk about what these ideas

2910
02:58:14.521 --> 02:58:17.810
are. And the worst comes to worst is,

2911
02:58:18.130 --> 02:58:23.130
is that I wasted a lot of my life on a crazy theory that turned out not to be

2912
02:58:23.341 --> 02:58:25.200
true. What was the response though?

2913
02:58:25.350 --> 02:58:29.010
Like how did the physicist react and what was, what was

2914
02:58:30.600 --> 02:58:31.950
disappointing about it?

2915
02:58:32.550 --> 02:58:37.080
So the articles in gendered a an immune reaction.

2916
02:58:37.920 --> 02:58:40.920
Immune. Yeah, it's an immune response. Okay, okay.

2917
02:58:40.921 --> 02:58:44.670
So somebody giving a lecture and now how many times have we heard before the

2918
02:58:44.671 --> 02:58:48.180
next Einstein, Yada, Yada, Yada, Yada. And I totally understand this.

2919
02:58:48.330 --> 02:58:51.660
It's a reasonable reaction. Like Sean Carroll had this reaction.

2920
02:58:52.080 --> 02:58:56.320
He referred to me as a backyard. Einstein and his wife Tim,

2921
02:58:56.400 --> 02:58:58.410
him twice today. Yeah, he's on my mind.

2922
02:58:59.490 --> 02:59:04.490
And his wife wrote this amazing article in scientific American called Dear

2923
02:59:05.070 --> 02:59:08.700
Guardian, you've been played. Now she's not a physicist,

2924
02:59:08.790 --> 02:59:11.850
but she has access to Sean's brain. And she writes on physics.

2925
02:59:14.070 --> 02:59:16.770
And then there was this whole thing where the new scientist said, okay,

2926
02:59:16.771 --> 02:59:20.070
this guy claimed to give this lecture in the physics department,

2927
02:59:20.071 --> 02:59:22.830
but he hasn't written a paper and he didn't tell the physicists.

2928
02:59:23.110 --> 02:59:26.370
So it was a sneak attack. Well of course that wasn't true there.

2929
02:59:26.460 --> 02:59:29.400
There was announcement of the talk. Um,

2930
02:59:29.760 --> 02:59:33.690
I stayed in England and I give the talk once more, uh,

2931
02:59:33.780 --> 02:59:37.740
and then it a final time a week later. And by that point,

2932
02:59:38.460 --> 02:59:41.790
all sorts of people from Cambridge and Oxford came to the talk cause it was a

2933
02:59:41.791 --> 02:59:44.310
worldwide topic of discussion. What the Hell is going on?

2934
02:59:45.330 --> 02:59:49.100
And I gave a two hour talk, consider that nobody,

2935
02:59:49.940 --> 02:59:53.360
nobody outside of theoretical physics gives talks on physics.

2936
02:59:53.490 --> 02:59:55.850
It's like North Korea. They don't get many visitors, right?

2937
02:59:56.160 --> 03:00:00.240
To the extent that they get visitors, they do get visitors from mathematics.

2938
03:00:00.241 --> 03:00:00.811
But in general,

2939
03:00:00.811 --> 03:00:03.450
mathematicians don't take an interest in the real physical world.

2940
03:00:03.451 --> 03:00:04.440
And to be blunt about it,

2941
03:00:04.441 --> 03:00:08.100
I don't think that the strength theorists are very focused on the real physical

2942
03:00:08.101 --> 03:00:11.320
world either. They'd been playing with toy models for you know,

2943
03:00:12.900 --> 03:00:13.920
nearly 40 years.

2944
03:00:16.170 --> 03:00:19.220
So a lot of it was playing out in the press. Um,

2945
03:00:19.620 --> 03:00:23.550
and the new scientist had to retract. They said no, what we wrote wasn't true.

2946
03:00:23.551 --> 03:00:27.280
They did publicize the talk and then there was an article,

2947
03:00:27.340 --> 03:00:32.340
they sent a reporter to the final talk that I gave and the reporter did not know

2948
03:00:33.511 --> 03:00:34.200
any physics.

2949
03:00:34.200 --> 03:00:38.340
So I spent the morning with this person teaching him what the Dirac equation was

2950
03:00:38.341 --> 03:00:42.360
like. A very fundamental thing and question came up in the talk about is your,

2951
03:00:43.290 --> 03:00:47.730
is your model anomaly free? And my model is,

2952
03:00:47.790 --> 03:00:51.260
has a property called [inaudible] [inaudible],

2953
03:00:51.270 --> 03:00:54.810
which is the difference between left, right?

2954
03:00:54.811 --> 03:00:57.660
Asymmetric models are called chiral and left, right?

2955
03:00:57.661 --> 03:01:01.360
Symmetric models are called a non Cairo.

2956
03:01:01.870 --> 03:01:03.460
So my model is non Chiral,

2957
03:01:03.490 --> 03:01:07.120
but the chiral nature of the universe is supposed to emerge from it.

2958
03:01:07.540 --> 03:01:10.850
And I was asked questions that didn't seem to make sense, which is you,

2959
03:01:10.900 --> 03:01:14.990
you can't have a chiral anomaly and a non chiral model. And the person,

2960
03:01:15.020 --> 03:01:17.500
the reporter picked up on this and didn't really get it.

2961
03:01:18.010 --> 03:01:22.490
So there was like a flurry of activity with a big WTF. And if you,

2962
03:01:22.570 --> 03:01:26.590
if you ask me, by the time I gave the second lecture,

2963
03:01:27.100 --> 03:01:30.280
people weren't laughing. Um, it was a serious lecture.

2964
03:01:30.640 --> 03:01:33.090
People heard that it was an, it was in the light.

2965
03:01:33.130 --> 03:01:37.210
It wasn't like somebody come up with their own language and their own, um,

2966
03:01:38.800 --> 03:01:42.730
you know, written in Crayon in some indecipherable thing. It was,

2967
03:01:42.731 --> 03:01:45.130
it was written in the normal language, but I hadn't written a paper.

2968
03:01:45.670 --> 03:01:49.630
And papers are very much the stock and trade of that community.

2969
03:01:50.590 --> 03:01:54.670
So I would say that the, the community settled on a rubric,

2970
03:01:54.671 --> 03:01:59.140
which is paper or it didn't happen. In other words, put up or shut up,

2971
03:01:59.141 --> 03:02:03.400
give us a paper. I had written something. Um,

2972
03:02:03.580 --> 03:02:06.520
but because my trajectory through this,

2973
03:02:06.670 --> 03:02:08.770
through math and physics was very unusual.

2974
03:02:09.880 --> 03:02:14.530
I have a very low trust of the academic community. I support them.

2975
03:02:14.531 --> 03:02:16.150
As you can tell, you know,

2976
03:02:16.151 --> 03:02:19.960
I'm extolling the virtues of science,

2977
03:02:20.680 --> 03:02:25.540
but I was subjected to a situation in graduate school where I had, uh,

2978
03:02:25.570 --> 03:02:29.440
I'm probably the only person you've ever met with a phd who was not allowed to

2979
03:02:29.441 --> 03:02:33.940
attend his own thesis defense. Why is that?

2980
03:02:34.060 --> 03:02:38.500
I don't know. What was your thesis? It was on, um,

2981
03:02:38.740 --> 03:02:43.330
self dual equations not being as peculiar to dimension four as was claimed.

2982
03:02:44.230 --> 03:02:49.000
But I had a situation in which the thesis when I had,

2983
03:02:49.350 --> 03:02:53.470
when I had entered Grad school was something that you would present to the

2984
03:02:53.471 --> 03:02:57.660
world. And by the time I was, uh,

2985
03:02:57.760 --> 03:02:58.630
trying to leave,

2986
03:02:59.260 --> 03:03:03.850
it was a closed door affair where the department would appoint the person for

2987
03:03:03.851 --> 03:03:07.180
you. And I was in the unusual position of not having a thesis advisor.

2988
03:03:08.110 --> 03:03:11.230
So there's some very fraught story. One thing you'll find is,

2989
03:03:11.231 --> 03:03:16.231
is that graduate school for some subclass of people becomes an extremely fraught

2990
03:03:17.500 --> 03:03:20.590
experience where the power of a department,

2991
03:03:20.591 --> 03:03:25.591
not to grant you a degree or not to help you get a job or to expel you,

2992
03:03:28.060 --> 03:03:32.830
um, becomes very contentious. Right? And that was the situation.

2993
03:03:32.860 --> 03:03:36.130
So I got into a very contentious situation that there was no explanation of why

2994
03:03:36.131 --> 03:03:40.720
it was so contentious. We can talk about it on another podcast, but,

2995
03:03:41.800 --> 03:03:46.450
um, I was in a very low trust situation with, um,

2996
03:03:46.510 --> 03:03:49.060
with Harvard and with the standard community.

2997
03:03:49.120 --> 03:03:54.120
And so when work that I had done that was rejected from my thesis,

2998
03:03:54.910 --> 03:03:59.180
uh, was discovered by others in 1994, um,

2999
03:03:59.200 --> 03:04:02.180
and revolutionized topological gauge theory,

3000
03:04:02.900 --> 03:04:07.900
I became very sort of Sullen and angry and withdrawn because my department knew

3001
03:04:08.781 --> 03:04:13.550
that I had put forward the same equations that became revolutionary in

3002
03:04:13.551 --> 03:04:17.120
mathematical gauge theory. Did you revisit it with them? Um,

3003
03:04:17.150 --> 03:04:20.720
there was a seminar where a guy named David [inaudible], uh,

3004
03:04:21.140 --> 03:04:25.700
who I very much admire, uh, the person who had been my advisor,

3005
03:04:25.790 --> 03:04:27.860
I don't want to name names, had, uh,

3006
03:04:28.760 --> 03:04:33.760
given a seminar saying all of gauge theory has been revolutionized.

3007
03:04:33.890 --> 03:04:38.270
Old Gates theory is dead. There's a new gauge theory. And

3008
03:04:39.980 --> 03:04:44.900
um, David caused on who I will name, uh,

3009
03:04:45.950 --> 03:04:49.550
said I was in the back center row.

3010
03:04:50.090 --> 03:04:54.860
I think I was picking my nose actually. And um, he said,

3011
03:04:54.861 --> 03:04:57.620
didn't we have a student who told us to look at these equations?

3012
03:04:58.580 --> 03:05:01.940
And suddenly the whole room turned around and looked at me.

3013
03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:05.030
I think this is in room five oh seven of the Harvard Science Center.

3014
03:05:06.080 --> 03:05:08.230
And it's just like, you know, try to imagine you're,

3015
03:05:08.231 --> 03:05:11.750
you're an anonymous person in a lecture and suddenly everyone is staring at you

3016
03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:17.510
and your fingers in your nose. And, um, that was the moment.

3017
03:05:18.210 --> 03:05:22.250
And I, and I think I mumbled something, um, just to get out of it.

3018
03:05:22.760 --> 03:05:26.430
But I was angry. I was angry that they'd taken away my agency. I wouldn't,

3019
03:05:26.431 --> 03:05:30.590
you know, better, better not to give me a phd better just to say, look,

3020
03:05:30.620 --> 03:05:34.400
we're going to go short. You screw off, you don't get a Phd.

3021
03:05:34.850 --> 03:05:37.940
And then if I end up doing something, screw you. You know,

3022
03:05:37.941 --> 03:05:39.380
that would've been a better outcome.

3023
03:05:40.220 --> 03:05:45.220
So instead I got a phd through a very torturous situation and I came to give up

3024
03:05:47.030 --> 03:05:51.770
on academics. I don't think that they're a fair system. I don't think that, uh,

3025
03:05:51.830 --> 03:05:52.680
it's open-minded.

3026
03:05:52.730 --> 03:05:56.840
I don't think that they welcome all sorts of different belief structures,

3027
03:05:57.980 --> 03:06:02.630
um, which are capable of producing innovations. So, you know, for my money,

3028
03:06:02.660 --> 03:06:04.340
I've been very vocal about this.

3029
03:06:04.341 --> 03:06:08.990
I've written articles and edged title work and I've said theoretical physics has

3030
03:06:08.991 --> 03:06:12.440
stalled and you've been claiming that you're going to ship strength,

3031
03:06:12.890 --> 03:06:15.800
strength theory and since 1984 will, where is it?

3032
03:06:17.450 --> 03:06:21.830
And it's always, you know, and years away. Now,

3033
03:06:21.831 --> 03:06:26.831
what was the premise of Sean Carroll's wife's article that they got played?

3034
03:06:27.530 --> 03:06:29.180
Well, Jamie, can you bring it up?

3035
03:06:32.600 --> 03:06:36.200
I had broken the rules. The rules.

3036
03:06:37.640 --> 03:06:40.790
You're supposed to submit a paper. The paper is supposed to be reviewed.

3037
03:06:41.120 --> 03:06:42.620
It's supposed to be appear in a journal.

3038
03:06:42.800 --> 03:06:45.140
You're not supposed to be doing this from mathematics.

3039
03:06:45.141 --> 03:06:48.440
You don't have training as a physicist. This is a hoax,

3040
03:06:49.940 --> 03:06:54.410
but it's on hogs. Well, I don't know. I mean if it is a hoax, it's on me.

3041
03:06:54.411 --> 03:06:58.200
Clearly not hoax. You're not hoaxing anyone. I'm not trying to,

3042
03:06:58.640 --> 03:07:02.160
so I don't understand [inaudible] okay.

3043
03:07:02.940 --> 03:07:06.330
Imagine that you're the, you're the Princeton physics department.

3044
03:07:07.140 --> 03:07:11.100
You probably have a corkboard on the wall called the crank, the crank board.

3045
03:07:12.540 --> 03:07:14.730
And every week somebody writes to you and says,

3046
03:07:15.450 --> 03:07:19.980
I figured out puppy perpetual emotion. Hmm. I have a laser transport device.

3047
03:07:21.210 --> 03:07:25.110
Right. And so everybody is concerned and frightened that their,

3048
03:07:25.200 --> 03:07:28.890
their time is going to be wasted right. By lunatics.

3049
03:07:30.990 --> 03:07:31.730
<v 5>No,</v>

3050
03:07:31.730 --> 03:07:36.730
<v 4>I both fit the lunatic profile and don't fit the lunatic profile on the lunatic</v>

3051
03:07:37.791 --> 03:07:40.670
side. I'm outside of the system. I haven't kept up,

3052
03:07:42.320 --> 03:07:46.190
I'm not particularly mathematically minded. I mean, in fact,

3053
03:07:46.250 --> 03:07:49.330
I'm sort of a B math student from high school, so it's kind of a,

3054
03:07:49.550 --> 03:07:54.550
I'm the only person I know with my profile with a phd in math and on the non

3055
03:07:56.330 --> 03:07:57.650
lunatic side. I mean, look,

3056
03:07:57.651 --> 03:08:01.400
you've been listening to my crazy ideas for awhile and they're all over the

3057
03:08:01.401 --> 03:08:04.700
world. I have lots of heterodox ideas. I don't think that I,

3058
03:08:04.701 --> 03:08:07.370
that they're taken as being insane. And I don't think,

3059
03:08:07.371 --> 03:08:11.570
this isn't saying that it's been looked at by enough people to say will until

3060
03:08:11.571 --> 03:08:14.870
you actually write it down very cleanly and clearly we can't fully evaluate,

3061
03:08:15.650 --> 03:08:19.740
but it's a, it's a gamble. And the worst thing that can happen is,

3062
03:08:19.950 --> 03:08:24.620
is that I have something that looks like a final theory that turns out not to

3063
03:08:24.621 --> 03:08:28.700
be, are you going to write it out? It's already mostly written up.

3064
03:08:30.500 --> 03:08:33.950
I'm in a different phase. I felt that I got rolled in an alley.

3065
03:08:34.850 --> 03:08:37.880
So here's, here's the big, here's the big reveal. Okay,

3066
03:08:38.750 --> 03:08:41.810
it's going to be a lot harder to roll me. I can roll myself,

3067
03:08:42.980 --> 03:08:45.410
I can screw this thing up just fine by myself.

3068
03:08:46.040 --> 03:08:50.810
But the opportunity to take me into a quiet corner and make something disappear

3069
03:08:50.811 --> 03:08:53.360
or to hand the credit to somebody else is going to be a lot harder to do.

3070
03:08:53.470 --> 03:08:54.970
Is that going to happen? Did you find it?

3071
03:08:56.690 --> 03:08:59.630
Do Your Guardian you've been played?

3072
03:08:59.780 --> 03:09:04.730
I love when they use like contemporary salons. So sketchy.

3073
03:09:04.760 --> 03:09:08.600
It's so good. So bitchy or you want to say bitchy when it's a girl?

3074
03:09:08.690 --> 03:09:13.580
What I wanna grow rights it. Um, I don't, I don't care.

3075
03:09:13.581 --> 03:09:17.790
I think, I mean, look, it's only like the future of, of a number of people you

3076
03:09:17.930 --> 03:09:22.070
<v 3>privately asking me about the recent guardian article and accompany an op Ed by</v>

3077
03:09:22.071 --> 03:09:25.470
Oxford mathematician, Marcos du Sautoy. How'd he say it?

3078
03:09:25.580 --> 03:09:30.560
Said to Marcus to Soto to, so toy gushing over suppose supposedly revolutionary.

3079
03:09:30.561 --> 03:09:35.240
You knew unified theory of physics by a man who officially left academia 20

3080
03:09:35.241 --> 03:09:40.241
years ago or as I've taken to calling it the Eric Weinstein's amazing new theory

3081
03:09:41.121 --> 03:09:45.740
that solves everything. Puzzling conundrum in theoretical physics only.

3082
03:09:45.741 --> 03:09:48.530
He hasn't written an actual, all these are capital letters.

3083
03:09:48.531 --> 03:09:52.280
That's why I'm saying it this way. The letters and actual paper yet.

3084
03:09:52.281 --> 03:09:54.070
So physicists can't check

3085
03:09:54.070 --> 03:09:58.420
<v 0>all those hard mathematical details, but trust us, it's going to be awesome.</v>

3086
03:09:58.780 --> 03:10:02.560
While that's super bitchy him. Wow. Yeah. I can say that.

3087
03:10:02.561 --> 03:10:07.210
I can say whatever the fuck I want a him with a period. First.

3088
03:10:07.211 --> 03:10:10.870
A couple of caveats. I've met Weinstein. He's a nice guy.

3089
03:10:11.440 --> 03:10:16.360
He's wicked smart. This is a stupid article because you know better.

3090
03:10:16.480 --> 03:10:21.130
Well, it's just the way it's written. It's just, it's a, it's catty. Yeah.

3091
03:10:21.160 --> 03:10:24.790
It's C for clear. Clearly. Yeah. Okay.

3092
03:10:26.140 --> 03:10:29.740
We could go do, she's playing enough. She's playing enforcer. Yes.

3093
03:10:29.770 --> 03:10:32.170
You broke the rules. Yes. We know why you broke the rules.

3094
03:10:32.200 --> 03:10:35.140
There's fame and fortune for you and you think that's what it is. Yeah. Well,

3095
03:10:35.141 --> 03:10:38.680
or you're delusional. Or what's her motivation for writing this article though?

3096
03:10:38.770 --> 03:10:43.300
That's what's weird. Well, she, she's a physics look, she, she comes from, um,

3097
03:10:43.810 --> 03:10:46.330
I think she's approached protege of Casey Cole,

3098
03:10:46.360 --> 03:10:51.220
the great physics writer from WHO's not a physicist in her defense. Yeah.

3099
03:10:51.250 --> 03:10:56.250
Do you feel that she felt this honestly and that this was problematic and in her

3100
03:10:58.451 --> 03:11:01.120
eyes that you were entering into this field,

3101
03:11:01.121 --> 03:11:05.080
that you had not written a paper and you had left academia 20 years ago and that

3102
03:11:05.081 --> 03:11:08.080
she was like, listen, I'm, so, this is all nonsense. Okay,

3103
03:11:08.081 --> 03:11:10.900
I'm going to put a stop to this nonsense and I'm going to do it with sort of

3104
03:11:10.901 --> 03:11:15.850
contemporary language and, and slang. I don't like the bitchiness but it's,

3105
03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:18.820
I understand the motivation [inaudible] look,

3106
03:11:19.030 --> 03:11:23.470
I think the bitchiness is to make the article more entertaining and more,

3107
03:11:24.430 --> 03:11:28.270
um, it's part of horrible part of her style as a writer. Okay.

3108
03:11:28.830 --> 03:11:31.920
Now I actually met her as she says, and I,

3109
03:11:32.150 --> 03:11:34.720
I had a very high and positive impression of her.

3110
03:11:35.110 --> 03:11:37.590
So why do you think she wrote this without discussing it? Look,

3111
03:11:38.110 --> 03:11:41.410
Shawn is also one of these people who's trying to enforce the rules.

3112
03:11:41.410 --> 03:11:45.490
He didn't have the easiest time, I think he didn't get tenure at cal tech.

3113
03:11:45.910 --> 03:11:47.580
He's kind of a stickler for reality.

3114
03:11:47.581 --> 03:11:51.880
He's on the one hand talking total nonsense about Boltzmann brains and thought

3115
03:11:51.881 --> 03:11:55.360
experiments, which is what I associate with desperation physics.

3116
03:11:55.361 --> 03:11:58.510
On the other hand, he's kind of this rigorous, um,

3117
03:11:59.170 --> 03:12:02.830
rationalist thinker who's an, you know, a prominent atheist.

3118
03:12:03.010 --> 03:12:06.800
So he's a complicated guy. He's a great explainer. Uh,

3119
03:12:06.880 --> 03:12:10.360
he's got his own sort of economic incentives that he's one of the very few

3120
03:12:10.361 --> 03:12:15.100
people who sort of a voice physics to the world and they, you know,

3121
03:12:15.101 --> 03:12:20.101
operate in some sense as a couple and there's a richness to this.

3122
03:12:20.830 --> 03:12:21.790
Like, you know, my,

3123
03:12:22.150 --> 03:12:26.470
my point isn't to run them down or to boost them up.

3124
03:12:26.471 --> 03:12:29.320
It's just people are playing at their roles.

3125
03:12:29.560 --> 03:12:34.000
Whenever anyone has a sentence that consists of one word and that word is a ham.

3126
03:12:35.970 --> 03:12:40.540
Yeah, it's, I did not enjoy that article by him. Well, but look,

3127
03:12:41.020 --> 03:12:44.770
yeah, but she's trying to throw me a bone. He's wicked smart. He's a nice guy,

3128
03:12:45.080 --> 03:12:47.740
but he's, but he's delusional. He's delusional.

3129
03:12:48.010 --> 03:12:52.040
And to the extent that I've been delusional before, I'm about the

3130
03:12:52.040 --> 03:12:55.340
<v 4>only person in the U S who's against high skilled immigration because people</v>

3131
03:12:55.341 --> 03:12:57.410
think, why should we keep out the best in the brightest?

3132
03:12:57.890 --> 03:13:00.710
And it's complicated story. Before the financial crisis,

3133
03:13:00.711 --> 03:13:04.210
I was saying mortgage backed securities may blow up the world. People are like,

3134
03:13:04.370 --> 03:13:07.580
are you kidding? It's the great moderation. We've banished volatility.

3135
03:13:09.740 --> 03:13:13.290
People have a chance to know me now. They know that I can get way out there.

3136
03:13:13.910 --> 03:13:17.060
I said this at the beginning. I get way out there. Yeah, okay.

3137
03:13:17.810 --> 03:13:21.050
I think Elon Munns Musk is totally wrong about going to Mars.

3138
03:13:21.051 --> 03:13:25.070
Mars is not going to save us and maybe going to the stars isn't going to save us

3139
03:13:25.070 --> 03:13:27.470
. Maybe the AI will follow us there, Yada Yada Yada,

3140
03:13:28.070 --> 03:13:29.900
but I'm not going to take this lying down.

3141
03:13:29.901 --> 03:13:34.670
We're in a desperate situation and if you're not trying, here's, here's the,

3142
03:13:34.671 --> 03:13:35.840
here's the clear thing.

3143
03:13:36.530 --> 03:13:39.470
We know what nuclear weapons look like in the fusion here.

3144
03:13:40.520 --> 03:13:44.660
If we are trying to get off this planet before people are unleashing gene drives

3145
03:13:44.661 --> 03:13:46.100
and you know,

3146
03:13:46.280 --> 03:13:49.820
weaponized anthrax and who knows what the hell people are going to get up to as

3147
03:13:51.050 --> 03:13:54.230
the power of biology and the power of physics keeps going in the power of

3148
03:13:54.231 --> 03:13:55.064
information.

3149
03:13:55.970 --> 03:13:56.803
<v 8>All right.</v>

3150
03:13:58.070 --> 03:14:02.210
<v 4>At least I'm trying. I think I'm doing a damn sight better than trying,</v>

3151
03:14:02.300 --> 03:14:04.370
but assume that I failed completely.

3152
03:14:06.740 --> 03:14:11.740
How crazy is it that we're not trying to take army arms against our New Sea of

3153
03:14:12.111 --> 03:14:16.650
troubles? It's time to rush the cockpit.

3154
03:14:17.880 --> 03:14:19.470
We've got to get Trump out of office.

3155
03:14:20.130 --> 03:14:23.430
We've got to restore sanity door sensemaking we need newspapers.

3156
03:14:23.431 --> 03:14:24.510
We need fact checkers.

3157
03:14:24.870 --> 03:14:28.590
We did what is particularly problematic about Trump being an office.

3158
03:14:29.790 --> 03:14:33.630
That man has nuclear capabilities and I have zero confidence in his decision

3159
03:14:33.631 --> 03:14:38.010
making and people imagine that I'm a Trump supporter after I've called him an

3160
03:14:38.011 --> 03:14:40.770
existential risk, you know, and my,

3161
03:14:40.830 --> 03:14:44.520
my boss and good friend Peter Teal was a supporter of Trump in the last

3162
03:14:44.521 --> 03:14:48.720
election. I'm taking a huge risk in how much I love this guy,

3163
03:14:48.721 --> 03:14:51.750
Peter Teal and how much he loves me. Uh,

3164
03:14:53.040 --> 03:14:57.360
because I'm putting the employer employee relationship at risk. When people say,

3165
03:14:57.370 --> 03:14:59.190
okay, you're just a Peter Teal tool, well,

3166
03:15:00.330 --> 03:15:03.450
nobody's going to take that kind of risk unless they have real faith in their

3167
03:15:03.451 --> 03:15:04.740
friend. And I work for a friend.

3168
03:15:05.430 --> 03:15:09.300
I mean a real friend person who doesn't cut and run when trouble starts.

3169
03:15:10.080 --> 03:15:13.450
And I totally disagree with Peter. Uh,

3170
03:15:14.100 --> 03:15:16.050
I have come to understand that Trump,

3171
03:15:17.820 --> 03:15:22.200
I thought people would understand the Trump danger and that the democratic party

3172
03:15:22.201 --> 03:15:24.540
would reevaluate their situation, but they didn't.

3173
03:15:24.570 --> 03:15:27.270
They tripled and quadrupled down. And that is alarming.

3174
03:15:27.330 --> 03:15:31.470
And so that's something I very much got wrong about Trump is that even Trump

3175
03:15:31.471 --> 03:15:34.890
wasn't enough of a message to let people know.

3176
03:15:34.920 --> 03:15:39.000
But Trump cannot have the nuclear codes. Um,

3177
03:15:39.270 --> 03:15:41.580
because he's not as skilled or regular enough player.

3178
03:15:41.640 --> 03:15:44.570
He's going to accomplish a lot. One of the things I said before the election is,

3179
03:15:44.700 --> 03:15:46.830
is he might be the best and worst of presidents.

3180
03:15:47.580 --> 03:15:51.240
He might get us a new North Korea deal because they're going to look at him and

3181
03:15:51.241 --> 03:15:54.090
say, this guy is nuts. Who knows what he would do.

3182
03:15:55.380 --> 03:15:57.150
But we, we,

3183
03:15:57.240 --> 03:16:01.890
the technical community created this problem and we're abdicating our

3184
03:16:01.891 --> 03:16:06.150
responsibility by worrying about our egos, by worrying about our reputations.

3185
03:16:06.440 --> 03:16:07.290
I am abdicating,

3186
03:16:08.400 --> 03:16:11.580
I should've turned this theory over to the theoretical physics community years

3187
03:16:11.580 --> 03:16:11.581
ago.

3188
03:16:11.581 --> 03:16:15.270
Even if they screwed me over and I'm too petty and egotistical to want to give

3189
03:16:15.271 --> 03:16:19.470
up on it, I've watched them take credit for things that weren't, you know,

3190
03:16:19.780 --> 03:16:23.270
an assigned credit. I don't like the way they work. I've,

3191
03:16:23.520 --> 03:16:26.940
I've the theoretical physics community is our most important community in the

3192
03:16:26.941 --> 03:16:31.941
world and it is also a very unpleasant community and we need to fund them and we

3193
03:16:33.211 --> 03:16:36.120
need to let them play. They're dangerous boys for the most part.

3194
03:16:36.580 --> 03:16:40.770
There are women, but in general, they're very unpleasant men. Um,

3195
03:16:41.970 --> 03:16:43.710
they have been somewhat cowed.

3196
03:16:44.030 --> 03:16:46.920
They're not the same cowboys they used to be because they'd been failing for 40

3197
03:16:46.921 --> 03:16:50.400
years. I should be sharing stuff. I should be writing things down.

3198
03:16:50.460 --> 03:16:51.930
I have not had the courage to do it.

3199
03:16:52.890 --> 03:16:55.440
And if I really have the courage of my convictions,

3200
03:16:55.590 --> 03:16:59.580
I should share this and see what happens. But one thing is,

3201
03:16:59.581 --> 03:17:02.550
I don't know if it could be weaponized. Assume it's right. You know, I have it.

3202
03:17:02.551 --> 03:17:06.060
This decision tree. Assume it's wrong. I've got egg on my face. It's okay.

3203
03:17:06.270 --> 03:17:09.600
I'll be okay. I worry much more about if it's right.

3204
03:17:10.470 --> 03:17:12.150
The two things that can go wrong, if it's right,

3205
03:17:13.350 --> 03:17:16.230
is one that could be weaponized before it becomes useful.

3206
03:17:16.260 --> 03:17:18.450
And two is that there's no solution than it may be.

3207
03:17:18.451 --> 03:17:21.900
We actually are stuck in this place. We never get to go to the stars.

3208
03:17:21.930 --> 03:17:25.680
We can look at exoplanets and dream, but we're stuck here until we change.

3209
03:17:25.681 --> 03:17:29.280
Human behavior isn't a trip to the stars.

3210
03:17:29.281 --> 03:17:32.790
Just a relocation of our own thoughts. We're kicking the, we're kicking butt.

3211
03:17:33.060 --> 03:17:34.920
We need time, man. We need time.

3212
03:17:35.370 --> 03:17:40.370
We have not gotten to the point where we don't even feel the danger we're in.

3213
03:17:41.780 --> 03:17:46.170
We are in so much danger and we haven't had almost anything happened since 1945

3214
03:17:46.171 --> 03:17:47.820
at the scale of World War II.

3215
03:17:48.630 --> 03:17:51.990
And so we've got magical thinking between our ears where we think it can't

3216
03:17:51.991 --> 03:17:53.750
happen here. You know,

3217
03:17:53.760 --> 03:17:57.150
this is the thing that makes me so fucking furious about,

3218
03:17:58.080 --> 03:18:02.400
I'm screwing around with Europeans and sovereignty,

3219
03:18:03.210 --> 03:18:06.570
which is Europe is a dangerous place.

3220
03:18:07.290 --> 03:18:08.940
Europe is historically a dangerous place.

3221
03:18:08.970 --> 03:18:13.050
It's been a place for years where college students can go and take in the sights

3222
03:18:13.050 --> 03:18:13.560
.

3223
03:18:13.560 --> 03:18:18.210
But it's a dangerous ethnic culture and Jews know this better than anyone.

3224
03:18:19.050 --> 03:18:22.860
And the one thing that the far left and the far right agree on is Jews and it's

3225
03:18:22.861 --> 03:18:25.380
not in a good way. Right?

3226
03:18:27.150 --> 03:18:30.420
So it is very important. We are the canaries in the coal mine.

3227
03:18:31.020 --> 03:18:34.830
We feel this stuff early and things are things that are coming apart.

3228
03:18:34.890 --> 03:18:37.110
The the physical world, the world of commerce,

3229
03:18:37.111 --> 03:18:41.190
the world of like structural engineering and building permits is still okay so

3230
03:18:41.191 --> 03:18:42.024
far.

3231
03:18:42.390 --> 03:18:46.710
But the intellectual world that sort of wraps that and keeps it in check is

3232
03:18:46.711 --> 03:18:51.250
coming unglued. And quite frankly, I don't want to go through that again.

3233
03:18:52.630 --> 03:18:55.360
We cannot afford another World War II cause World War II won't,

3234
03:18:55.510 --> 03:19:00.100
won't look like World War II. [inaudible] three. Yeah. And I don't know,

3235
03:19:00.101 --> 03:19:01.660
maybe it'll look like information warfare.

3236
03:19:01.661 --> 03:19:04.570
Maybe it won't look like anything like a war that we've seen before. Yeah,

3237
03:19:05.260 --> 03:19:07.570
but you know, the problem is, Joe,

3238
03:19:07.600 --> 03:19:12.600
is that I've got some sort of a wildly tattooed martial artists to cross for me.

3239
03:19:12.730 --> 03:19:16.630
I'm some sort of guy who dropped out of academics years ago and doesn't have a

3240
03:19:16.810 --> 03:19:20.980
published paper in this area, and I really literally think,

3241
03:19:21.940 --> 03:19:23.320
and maybe it comes down to you and me,

3242
03:19:23.920 --> 03:19:28.920
maybe we use this podcast and some crazy ass differential geometry to at least

3243
03:19:29.021 --> 03:19:32.020
make a go of it to at least at the minimum,

3244
03:19:32.050 --> 03:19:36.430
excite somebody to think maybe it's possible to make progress. Well,

3245
03:19:36.520 --> 03:19:41.520
what's interesting about that is what you've said is reaching an astonishing

3246
03:19:42.131 --> 03:19:45.820
number of years. That's not eyes. This is why I pushed out. Look,

3247
03:19:45.821 --> 03:19:47.800
I've been responsible about this up until now.

3248
03:19:47.801 --> 03:19:52.360
This is my first really irresponsible podcast. Why is it irresponsible? No,

3249
03:19:52.361 --> 03:19:55.150
I don't know. Maybe it's egotistical. Maybe I shouldn't be talking about this.

3250
03:19:55.151 --> 03:19:56.170
I guarantee you they're going to be,

3251
03:19:56.171 --> 03:19:58.720
a lot of people in physics departments are going to be pissed off when this

3252
03:19:58.721 --> 03:20:01.180
hits. Yeah, but it's your thoughts.

3253
03:20:01.270 --> 03:20:03.370
There's nothing responsible about your thoughts. Well,

3254
03:20:03.730 --> 03:20:07.390
you have to appreciate that when you're working as hard as these guys have.

3255
03:20:07.630 --> 03:20:12.400
And these guys had been slogging in the salt mines for forever with no progress

3256
03:20:12.740 --> 03:20:17.620
in of the type. I mean, since the early seventies, it's pretty galling.

3257
03:20:18.880 --> 03:20:23.440
It's pretty galling to hear somebody talking like this who has the luxury of an

3258
03:20:23.441 --> 03:20:25.840
invite to this podcast with no vetting,

3259
03:20:27.130 --> 03:20:31.630
with nothing behind him other than the hope that maybe he's done something

3260
03:20:31.631 --> 03:20:35.320
that's interesting and I've never spoken about this. You know,

3261
03:20:35.321 --> 03:20:38.770
I have a recording for example, of the, the lecture that I did at Oxford,

3262
03:20:41.050 --> 03:20:45.760
um, which I chose not to release. You know, I just, it was so unpleasant.

3263
03:20:46.950 --> 03:20:49.990
Like the cattiness, the bitchiness, the nastiness, the undercutting,

3264
03:20:49.991 --> 03:20:53.320
the idea that this came down to ego or fame.

3265
03:20:53.920 --> 03:20:57.280
I guarantee you the thing that I really like least about what I'm about to do

3266
03:20:57.281 --> 03:21:01.570
with this podcast is fame. I think fame is a bad,

3267
03:21:02.440 --> 03:21:04.570
it's a bad deal. Like you, you have to deal with this.

3268
03:21:04.571 --> 03:21:08.290
You don't want to say what your location is, where you're going to be. You know,

3269
03:21:08.470 --> 03:21:11.800
people react all day long. People say, can you get me into Joe Rogan?

3270
03:21:11.830 --> 03:21:14.380
Can you connect me with Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan.

3271
03:21:14.710 --> 03:21:19.570
It's constant. I get two to three requests a week. I don't want it.

3272
03:21:20.470 --> 03:21:24.790
I've had a wonderful 53 years without being very well known.

3273
03:21:24.970 --> 03:21:27.550
And if this doesn't work out, I'll go back to being very well,

3274
03:21:27.910 --> 03:21:32.620
not very well known. My, my greater fears is that maybe, maybe it will work.

3275
03:21:34.150 --> 03:21:37.960
And then the thing that I really care about is, does it get, does it help?

3276
03:21:39.130 --> 03:21:42.880
Does it buy us time? Can we get off the planet? Is there anything we can do?

3277
03:21:42.881 --> 03:21:44.650
If we actually know the source code? You know,

3278
03:21:44.651 --> 03:21:49.651
John Brockman runs this thing called edge.org and every year he asked a question

3279
03:21:50.030 --> 03:21:51.500
to like 200 scientists.

3280
03:21:52.880 --> 03:21:57.050
And finally he got tired of that asking the, the annual question. So he said,

3281
03:21:57.051 --> 03:22:01.520
okay, 20 years is enough. The last question is, what is the final question?

3282
03:22:02.210 --> 03:22:05.390
And Jamie, could I ask you to bring up uh,

3283
03:22:05.450 --> 03:22:10.450
edge.org and my name and my answer on must've been 29,

3284
03:22:12.830 --> 03:22:14.120
2018.

3285
03:22:16.150 --> 03:22:16.983
<v 9>Okay.</v>

3286
03:22:20.120 --> 03:22:21.760
<v 4>And it's interesting because, you know, I,</v>

3287
03:22:22.130 --> 03:22:26.610
I kept putting stuff out in edge. Like for example,

3288
03:22:26.611 --> 03:22:31.170
I was very worried about professional wrestling, uh, preceding an election.

3289
03:22:31.590 --> 03:22:33.240
So I did an article on Kayfabe,

3290
03:22:33.241 --> 03:22:37.470
which is the system of lies that under undergirds wrestling.

3291
03:22:37.530 --> 03:22:41.070
And I did one on bitcoin called go virtual young man.

3292
03:22:41.430 --> 03:22:44.790
So nobody ever paid attention to my series of answers to the edge question.

3293
03:22:44.791 --> 03:22:46.080
So this is the last question.

3294
03:22:46.081 --> 03:22:50.220
The last question unprecedented happened when we finally learn our own source

3295
03:22:50.221 --> 03:22:55.140
code. Nobody cared. This is the question that obsesses me.

3296
03:22:55.170 --> 03:22:59.430
This is what I say I've left this planet is this is what I'm focused on.

3297
03:23:00.360 --> 03:23:04.800
What happens if we actually figure out where we are, where this place is?

3298
03:23:04.830 --> 03:23:06.330
What are we doing? Who are we,

3299
03:23:08.580 --> 03:23:13.380
what built this and who acts on that information. Once we do figure it out,

3300
03:23:14.040 --> 03:23:15.120
what steps are taken?

3301
03:23:15.150 --> 03:23:18.090
I don't know whether or not the consequences of those steps are ever really

3302
03:23:18.091 --> 03:23:19.530
full. You know, I always thought out,

3303
03:23:19.590 --> 03:23:23.910
I always tried to talk to somebody like government or the intelligence services.

3304
03:23:23.911 --> 03:23:27.960
Like I don't know whether I have something. Maybe I do. Maybe I don't,

3305
03:23:27.961 --> 03:23:28.794
but wouldn't, wouldn't,

3306
03:23:29.000 --> 03:23:31.350
wouldn't you guys want to know it has a schedule and you know,

3307
03:23:31.351 --> 03:23:35.250
never was able to get anybody interested. I, I went through graduate school on

3308
03:23:36.820 --> 03:23:36.960
the Office of Naval Researches,

3309
03:23:36.960 --> 03:23:41.670
a top grant for graduate study and I always thought they would check in with me,

3310
03:23:41.671 --> 03:23:42.540
but they never have.

3311
03:23:44.820 --> 03:23:49.820
So like the federal government paid for my postdoc and the military paid for my

3312
03:23:50.371 --> 03:23:53.520
graduate education and Harvard doesn't care and they don't, nobody cares.

3313
03:23:53.521 --> 03:23:56.910
Nobody believes that anything is possible. Which is the really interesting part.

3314
03:23:56.940 --> 03:23:59.160
What do you mean by that? Nobody believes anything in that pot. I mean,

3315
03:23:59.640 --> 03:24:03.330
really astronomical breakthroughs. Yeah. Like we all know,

3316
03:24:03.450 --> 03:24:07.560
we're waiting to see what, uh, Tim Cook is going to do for the next iPhone.

3317
03:24:09.030 --> 03:24:13.770
Will Ilan get to Mars? Does anyone actually care about Mars? I, I'm,

3318
03:24:14.520 --> 03:24:17.640
I was there for the Moon landings and let me tell you,

3319
03:24:17.641 --> 03:24:22.410
we were bored of the moon by the time we left. It's a very weird thing to say,

3320
03:24:22.411 --> 03:24:25.680
but that's something I, I was born in 1965 we were bored. Well,

3321
03:24:25.681 --> 03:24:29.250
my perception of the whole Mars thing is it's the shittiest location that we can

3322
03:24:29.251 --> 03:24:30.084
get to.

3323
03:24:30.270 --> 03:24:34.590
It's a bad name for the best note location that we can get to that isn't this

3324
03:24:34.591 --> 03:24:39.030
one? Well, yeah, but it's also like we have spots on earth. Itzhak yeah,

3325
03:24:39.190 --> 03:24:44.010
we don't even go there. We don't even go there. But like at least you know,

3326
03:24:44.011 --> 03:24:48.710
hats off to Ilan that he at least inspires people by he,

3327
03:24:48.720 --> 03:24:52.440
he followed up the scent when we gave up on progress. Right.

3328
03:24:54.510 --> 03:24:57.990
So my point is we're not, nobody thinks this is going to work.

3329
03:24:59.190 --> 03:25:02.520
I can say it on the show. It can generate a little bit of flurry of activity.

3330
03:25:02.640 --> 03:25:04.530
It'll die down within a week. We're going to go back to,

3331
03:25:05.160 --> 03:25:08.010
you know who got milkshake, right.

3332
03:25:08.220 --> 03:25:12.150
And we're going to want to know is Tulsa is Tulsi gaining on Andrew? You know,

3333
03:25:12.180 --> 03:25:15.510
what about Biden can the center hold? Well the fringe come in.

3334
03:25:16.080 --> 03:25:21.030
We're just constantly distracted and at least this is going to be entertaining.

3335
03:25:22.470 --> 03:25:27.390
We are at three hours and three hours,

3336
03:25:27.420 --> 03:25:31.590
three and a half hours. See last time we almost got to four hours.

3337
03:25:32.610 --> 03:25:36.480
I'm happy to end it. If people will go to the portal,

3338
03:25:36.630 --> 03:25:40.680
the portal with Eric Weinstein on, on apple, apple,

3339
03:25:40.890 --> 03:25:44.820
Spotify, Spotify and popular clients for podcast.

3340
03:25:46.020 --> 03:25:49.860
I'm sure they will. This is going to be an interesting one. I'm,

3341
03:25:49.861 --> 03:25:53.800
I'm really curious to see what kind of blowback this one's going to. Well,

3342
03:25:53.970 --> 03:25:56.520
two things, Joe. One, um,

3343
03:25:57.390 --> 03:26:02.190
you along with Sam, uh, and my brother,

3344
03:26:03.660 --> 03:26:07.140
uh, really encouraged me to do this,

3345
03:26:07.440 --> 03:26:11.910
so I'm holding you personally responsible for whatever goes wrong. Um,

3346
03:26:12.390 --> 03:26:14.940
the second thing is I really just,

3347
03:26:15.180 --> 03:26:19.740
I have such a positive feeling about what you've done, uh,

3348
03:26:19.741 --> 03:26:23.610
in terms of empowering people like really touched me that when my brother was

3349
03:26:23.611 --> 03:26:27.970
shit out of luck, you did a bunch of shows with him, uh,

3350
03:26:28.080 --> 03:26:30.510
and helped him get to a safe place.

3351
03:26:30.511 --> 03:26:34.230
And I just want to say that there is like an aspect we we keep talking about.

3352
03:26:34.231 --> 03:26:38.580
Is there any use for men whatsoever and standing up in a situation in which you

3353
03:26:38.581 --> 03:26:42.900
can take a fair amount of guff, you can take a lot of heat. Uh, you know,

3354
03:26:42.901 --> 03:26:44.730
you said this thing to me that was really amazing,

3355
03:26:44.731 --> 03:26:46.500
which is that this is a golden age of comedy.

3356
03:26:46.710 --> 03:26:50.010
And my interpretation was that there was a period of time where nobody could

3357
03:26:50.011 --> 03:26:52.170
figure out how to tell a joke on a college campus.

3358
03:26:52.171 --> 03:26:57.171
And our best comedians have figured out how to be compassionate enough and kind

3359
03:26:57.181 --> 03:27:02.181
enough and touch the things that are animating us and making us uncomfortable

3360
03:27:02.790 --> 03:27:04.450
and that that's what you're a part of. And so I,

3361
03:27:04.451 --> 03:27:06.780
I view you as like a very delicate neurosurgeon.

3362
03:27:06.781 --> 03:27:08.430
I watched the evolution for example,

3363
03:27:08.880 --> 03:27:13.020
of your jokes about professional wrestling being gay right now.

3364
03:27:13.021 --> 03:27:17.460
Seriously stay with me Joe. I watched that.

3365
03:27:17.520 --> 03:27:20.610
It was always funny, but it got better and better and better.

3366
03:27:21.120 --> 03:27:25.770
And the idea that that could be told in a way that you'd be totally comfortable

3367
03:27:25.830 --> 03:27:27.140
with, you know,

3368
03:27:27.150 --> 03:27:30.330
your gay friend or lover right next to you laughing your ass off.

3369
03:27:31.200 --> 03:27:36.150
Taught me a lot about the power of just radiating decency, um,

3370
03:27:36.210 --> 03:27:40.060
that well together with analytic thought.

3371
03:27:40.180 --> 03:27:43.660
And it's a bit of template. I don't know that I have the skill to pull this off,

3372
03:27:44.110 --> 03:27:45.250
but you've been an inspiration.

3373
03:27:45.251 --> 03:27:48.250
I just want to say thank you for having me back on the program. My pleasure,

3374
03:27:48.251 --> 03:27:51.280
my friend. It's always a pleasure. Thank you. All right. Thank you.

3375
03:27:51.960 --> 03:27:52.793
<v 8>Bye everybody.</v>

3376
03:27:56.380 --> 03:27:57.250
<v 10>That was fucked up.</v>

3377
03:28:07.180 --> 03:28:08.013
<v 8>Okay.</v>

3378
03:28:11.340 --> 03:28:11.340
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>
