00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
&gt;&gt; I'm actually going to discuss the topic
of the Middle East and

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.240
what's headed in the future for the Arab leaders
and leaders worldwide

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.279
are working on the Middle East.
Maybe there has been some focus and some realizing

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.189
of the importance of
the issue in Jordan and a little bit regionally,

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.900
however,
internationally and many in the US, it hasn't

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.390
been as expected.
What is really needed on this aspect is needed

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.030
to take quick actions in
this regard as we truly need that we, as a

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.260
community.
There's no quick action in that aspect within

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.440
the next couple of
months, there will be will be a big challenge

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.940
to the whole continuing
of the peace process.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.140
Now in the regard the issue of the Palestine/Israeli
topic and whether

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.160
it is important or not -- yes, it is actually
the most important.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.440
And that needs to get addressed.
And if you look at any other issues related

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.019
to the region they will
all -- this topic will all always crop up

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.350
as the critical one.
So my advice and my recommendation as a young

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.280
global leader, that this
should be addressed as a critical solution

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.470
in order to be able to
realize the prosperity and the sustainability

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.549
whether economically or
politically in the next years.

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:16.950
Thank you.
