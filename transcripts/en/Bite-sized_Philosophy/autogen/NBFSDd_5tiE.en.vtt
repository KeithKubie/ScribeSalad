because no matter how you categorize

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310
because no matter how you categorize
 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.129

that's actually why you categorize

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859
that's actually why you categorize
 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.979
that's actually why you categorize
things right because of every category

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989
things right because of every category
 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.849

categorization and you can't just scrap
 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.229
categorization and you can't just scrap
categorization because without

struggling against is certainly one of
 

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:08.800

the things that you actually rely on and

everything that's ever happened and
 

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.450
everything that's ever happened and
pretty much everything that's currently

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:31.460
pretty much everything that's currently
 

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.610
pretty much everything that's currently
happening elsewhere in the world and you

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:33.620
happening elsewhere in the world and you
 

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.170
happening elsewhere in the world and you
can kind of tell that by the fact that

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:35.180
can kind of tell that by the fact that
 

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.330
can kind of tell that by the fact that
people tend to cut to emigrate to the

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:37.340
people tend to cut to emigrate to the
 

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.490
people tend to cut to emigrate to the

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:39.500

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:41.750
know the postmodern neo-marxists would
 

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.120
know the postmodern neo-marxists would
have an answer to that which would be

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:43.130
have an answer to that which would be
 

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.830
have an answer to that which would be
the only reason the West functions is

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:44.840
the only reason the West functions is
 

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.560
the only reason the West functions is
because it's raped the rest of the of

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:46.570
because it's raped the rest of the of
 

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:52.570
because it's raped the rest of the of
humanity and the planet but you know the

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:52.580
humanity and the planet but you know the
 

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.810
humanity and the planet but you know the
less said about that the better
