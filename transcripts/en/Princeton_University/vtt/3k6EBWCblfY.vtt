[SAWING]

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.900
DAN STEINGART: I try as much
as possible to encourage

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.450
exploration and hacking and
throwing a lot of spaghetti

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.100
at the wall and then kind
of seeing what underlying

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.480
physics come out of that.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.840
We don't just make things
randomly but we go with hunches

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.050
and if see that hunch works
and refine it, refine it,

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.890
refine it.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:22.390
Right.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.320
So it's not that
it's smaller this.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.230
It's not that's
bigger in the AA.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.290
I'm Dan Steingart.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.710
I'm an assistant professor in
the Department of Mechanical

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.890
and Aerospace Engineering
and the Andlinger Center

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.190
for Energy and the Environment.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.720
[TAPPING]

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.830
I study everything that
has to do with a battery.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.410
Its materials, its packaging,
its power electronics,

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.940
and its failure.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.340
So my lab is set up
to make new materials,

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.610
put those new materials into
batteries in various ways

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.900
because how you put the
battery together matters a lot,

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.450
make batteries of different
sizes, test those batteries,

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.610
beat them up, kill them,
and then dissect them

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.320
and look at them.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.880
And then repeat the cycle again.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:11.410
If this is true and R is
constant, then pV/RT equals 1.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.390
The challenge in
teaching and I think

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.240
the benefit is
structuring right â€”-

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.830
so student's time is valuable.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.750
Students want to get a
lot done, particularly

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.950
Princeton students,
but they also

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.530
want to own things and
truly understand things.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.640
And when you do it right,
you structure a problem

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.820
in such a way that when the
student gets the answer right

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.370
or sees the answer unfold,
either in their brain

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.840
or on the piece of
paper in front of them,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.300
they have an aha moment and
they take ownership of it.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.770
I hope that the
students take away

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.990
an understanding of
how to diagnose and fix

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.870
complex systems.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.250
And something that my Ph.D.
adviser instilled in me I think

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.580
is really important is not
to make the perfect the enemy

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.450
of the good.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.070
So as Ivy League
students, everyone

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.290
tries to get the
A or the A plus.

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.140
But when you're
developing things

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.350
and you want to introduce
a product to the world,

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.600
the world has to have time
to respond to that product,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.730
then you have to have time
to respond to the world.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.460
And if you wait for
perfection, you're

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.970
never going to release anything.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.590
We make things, we break things,
we study why they've broken,

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.720
we try to make them better.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.830
And I try to make those cycles
as tight as possible and codify

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.290
that process.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.800
So if students can
diagnose things,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.090
fix them, and make them better,

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.360
and if they can simply do
that when they leave my lab,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.860
I'm happy.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.620
MIKE WANG: Dan wants
us to be independent

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.580
and he also wants us to have
the freedom to do what we want

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.200
and to pursue what
we're interested in.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.550
He'll try to point
us in some direction,

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.580
tell us a cool idea he has.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.370
If there's one thing
that I would take away

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.190
from working with him is that
there's always a creative way

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.150
to do things and a
novel way to do things.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.440
DAN STEINGART: Princeton allows for
a lot of creativity.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.370
People generally don't think of
engineers as creative people.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.730
But my colleagues
and my students

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.460
are among the most creative
people I've ever met.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.000
And I've not seen a maximization
of resources like this

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.640
anywhere else I've been.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.630
I try to have my students
leading the projects

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.700
and looking at me like an old
man that's behind the times.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.160
But by the time they're in
their second or third year here,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.400
I want to be outdated and
baggage by the time they leave.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.010
So if they're not
teaching me things

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.420
by the third or fourth year,
I'm doing something wrong.
