00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.280
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
the U.S. Air Force.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.220
The best way to get over your fear of spiders
is to pick up a spider.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:18.619
YEAH, THIS WILL GO FINE.

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:25.029
Self-preservation instinct exists in every
type of life form, even single-celled organisms.

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.809
As our brains advance we began to grasp logic
and reason, and understand complex emotions

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:35.179
like sympathy, but the limbic system, which
controls fear, is still deep in there.

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:38.940
Fear is a powerful thing and overcoming it
can be even more difficult.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.149
The amygdala is ready to hit the panic button
in a second, and it's always there... deep

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.289
in your brain...

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.030
Evolution has built us to avoid fear, and
it's so strong people who are paralyzed by

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.359
trauma may change their entire social structure
to avoid triggering their amygdala.

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:01.239
One way to get over a fear is called, "Exposure
Therapy," where psychotherapists use relaxation

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.610
techniques combined with desensitization to
help people curb and control their fears.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.300
It's a tricky business, specialists have to
balance the exposure with the relaxation techniques,

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.680
using classical conditioning to retrain the
patient's limbic system.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.759
Sort of like Pavlov training dogs to salivate
when they hear a bell, exposure therapy retrains

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.259
the amygdala so fear responses are desensitized.

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.780
They don't want to overwhelm the amygdala,
or they'll risk re-traumatizing the person,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.180
so exposure therapy can take a while.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.479
Instead, specialists will work to explore
the fear and desensitize one little bit at

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:39.479
a time.

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.979
So, if someone suffers from panic attacks,
psychologists might ask a patient run to get

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.860
their heart rate up, so they don't fear the
pounding in their chest.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.130
It's pretty intense stuff!

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:58.689
Of course, fear of spiders, heights, and like…
sitting down (kathisophobia) are all pretty

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.820
easy to practice with exposure therapy.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.009
Over time, when paired with relaxation training,
your amygdala will tone down the panic, and

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.170
patients are able to actually overcome the
fear!

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.150
For things where the patient CAN'T go back,
like abuse or military PTSD, psychotherapists

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.280
are turning to technology.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.740
Virtual Reality Exposure, can put people in
controlled situations that help desensitize

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.240
bits of a bad experience in a safe environment.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.530
Rather than putting someone who is afraid
of flying on an airplane, they could be put

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.530
in a VR headset!

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.440
The University of Southern California has
been using VR exposure therapy since 2005

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.020
to work with veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.620
Using a VR headset and an XBox game, military
personnel can experience virtual reality,

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:48.320
3D audio, vibrations and even smells -- helping
to selectively expose parts and desensitize

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.880
PTSD sufferers!

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.350
Technology to the rescue!

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.621
According to an NIH study in Journal of Clinical
Psychology, even after six sessions, patients

00:02:57.621 --> 00:03:01.860
reported decreased feelings of psychological
distress and PTSD symptoms!

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.270
In another study in the Journal of Trauma
and Stress, VR therapy significantly reduced

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.180
symptoms in 62 percent of patients.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.730
The limbic system evolved in a time when we
could be killed at any moment, and the fear

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.070
response was a way to keep us safe and alive.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.220
Today, it would make sense to be able to shut
off this fear-based, ancient brain, but we're

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.410
not there yet.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.430
Instead, we have to learn to overcome our
fears and live courageously.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.590
Luckily, science is working on it!

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.370
You know who’s good at overcoming fear?

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.170
The brave men and women in the United States
Air Force!

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.960
Whether it’s overcoming poverty to become
a nurse and officer or becoming the first

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.120
female Thunderbird pilot, these Airmen are
doing what others once thought was impossible.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.790
So, a big shout out to the U.S. Air Force
for making this episode possible!

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:52.620
What are you afraid of?
