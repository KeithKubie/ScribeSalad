00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.770
The equation for line A is x equals 2, and the equation for line B is y equals

00:00:04.782 --> 00:00:09.825
negative 5. Let's talk about why. Remember that along any vertical line, every

00:00:09.837 --> 00:00:14.761
single point has the same x value. The y values are going to range everywhere

00:00:14.773 --> 00:00:19.528
negative infinity all the way to positive infinity. But the x one it stays

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.975
constant along that entire range. So, this is the only equation that we can

00:00:23.987 --> 00:00:27.895
write that fits every point along that line. There's a similar deal for line B

00:00:27.907 --> 00:00:31.905
and other horizontal lines. But regarding their y-coordinates instead of their

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:35.825
x-coordinates. We said that every point along a horizontal line has the same y

00:00:35.837 --> 00:00:39.965
value. Its x values go from negative infinity to positive infinity. But the only

00:00:39.977 --> 00:00:44.157
equation that accurately describes every point along the line is y equals

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:48.970
negative 5. Vertical and horizontal lines then have sort of special equations

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:53.400
because they only have one variable in them. This is pretty different from

00:00:53.412 --> 00:00:58.152
equations of other lines we've seen, like for example y equals 3 x minus 2. Here

00:00:58.164 --> 00:01:02.292
we have an x and y in the same equation. What these equations show is,

00:01:02.304 --> 00:01:07.303
respectively, that for vertical lines, this relation with x is going to be true

00:01:07.315 --> 00:01:12.163
regardless of y value. And for horizontal lines, this equation involving y is

00:01:12.175 --> 00:01:15.687
going to be true regardless of x value, or for any x value.
