00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.140
Good afternoon.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.410
We've done a lot of
work with vectors.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.050
In a lot of the problems, when
we launch something into--- In

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.920
the projectile motion problems,
or when you were

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.620
doing the incline plane
problems. I always gave you a

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.370
vector, like I would draw
a vector like this.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.440
I would say something
has a velocity of

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.420
10 meters per second.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.900
It's at a 30 degree angle.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.060
And then I would break it up
into the x and y components.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.550
So if I called this vector v, I
would use a notation, v sub

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.910
x, and the v sub x would have
been this vector right here.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.200
v sub x would've been this
vector down here.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.740
The x component of the vector.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.575
And then v sub y would have been
the y component of the

00:00:45.575 --> 00:00:49.800
vector, and it would have
been this vector.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.390
So this was v sub x,
this was v sub y.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.610
And hopefully by now, it's
second nature of how we would

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.260
figure these things out. v sub
x would be 10 times cosine of

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.860
this angle.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.200
10 cosine of 30 degrees, which I
think is square root of 3/2,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.890
but we're not worried about
that right now.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.810
And v sub y would be 10 times
the sine of that angle.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.740
This hopefully should be
second nature to you.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.560
If it's not, you can just go
through SOH-CAH-TOA and say,

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.180
well, the sine of 30 degrees
is the opposite of the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.890
hypotenuse.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:25.820
And you would get
back to this.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.030
But we've reviewed all of that,
and you should review

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.160
the initial vector videos.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.590
But what I want you to do now,
because this is useful for

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.430
simple projectile motion
problems-- But once we start

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.700
dealing with more complicated
vectors-- and maybe we're

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.190
dealing with multi-dimensional
of vectors, three-dimensional

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.170
vectors, or we start doing
linear algebra, where we do

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.790
end dimensional factors --we
need a coherent way, an

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.450
analytical way, instead of
having to always draw a

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.660
picture of representing
vectors.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.700
So what we do is, we use
something I call, and I think

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.630
everyone calls it, unit
vector notation.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.860
So what does that mean?

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.530
So we define these
unit vectors.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.070
Let me draw some axes.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.720
And it's important to keep in
mind, this might seem a little

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.699
confusing at first, but this
is no different than what

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.350
we've been doing in our physics
problem so far.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:20.980
Let me draw the axes
right there.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:29.600
Let's say that this is 1,
this is 0, this is 2.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.450
0, 1, 2.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.410
I don't know if must been
writing an Arabic or

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.820
something, going backwards.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.640
This is 0, 1, 2,
that's not 20.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.240
And then let's say this is 1,
this is 2, in the y direction.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.200
I'm going to define what I call
the unit vectors in two

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.020
dimensions.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.720
So I'm going to first
define a vector.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.970
I'll call this vector i.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.220
And this is the vector.

00:02:58.175 --> 00:03:02.000
It just goes straight in the x
direction, has no y component,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.140
and it has the magnitude of 1.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.450
And so this is i.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.470
We denote the unit vector
by putting this little

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.620
cap on top of it.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.540
There's multiple notations.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.480
Sometimes in the book, you'll
see this i without the cap,

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.410
and it's just boldface.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.370
There's some other notations.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.640
But if you see i, and not in
the imaginary number sense,

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.255
you should realize that that's
the unit vector.

00:03:25.255 --> 00:03:28.960
It has magnitude 1 and it's
completely in the x direction.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.200
And I'm going to define another
vector, and that one

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.710
is called j.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.750
And that is the same thing
but in the y direction.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.200
That is the vector j.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.600
You put a little cap over it.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.290
So why did I do this?

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.000
Well, if I'm dealing with
two dimensions.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.325
And as later we'll see in three
dimensions, so there

00:03:48.325 --> 00:03:50.090
will actually be a third
dimension and we'll call that

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.070
k, but don't worry about
that right now.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.480
But if we're dealing in two
dimensions, we can define any

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.800
vector in terms of some sum
of these two vectors.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.270
So how does that work?

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.780
Well, this vector here,
let's call it v.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.860
This vector, v, is
the sum of its x

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.200
component plus its y component.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.450
When you add vectors, you
can put them head

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.600
to tail like this.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.320
And that's the sum.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.589
So hopefully knowing what we
already know, we knew that the

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:21.079
vector, v, is equal to its x

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.910
component plus its y component.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.270
When you add vectors, you
essentially just put

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.080
them head to tails.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.840
And then the resulting sum
is where you end up.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.340
It would be if you added this
vector, and then you put this

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.170
tail to this head.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.910
And you end up there.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:38.480
So you end up there.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.300
So that's the vector.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:46.820
So can we define v sub x as some
multiple of i, of this

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.160
unit vector?

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.070
Well, sure.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.610
v sub x completely goes
in the x direction.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.590
But it doesn't have
a magnitude of 1.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.150
It has a magnitude of 10
cosine 30 degrees.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.870
So its magnitude is ten.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.340
Let me draw the unit
vector up here.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.640
This is the unit vector i.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.550
It's going to look something
like this and this.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.120
So v sub x is in the exact same
direction, and it's just

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.820
a scaled version of
this unit vector.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.120
And what multiple is it
of that unit vector?

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.320
Well, the unit vector has
a magnitude of 1.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.720
This has a magnitude of 10
cosine of 30 degrees.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.130
I think that's like, 5
square roots of 3, or

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.070
something like that.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:34.200
So we can write v sub x-- I keep
switching colors to keep

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.850
things interesting.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:42.680
We can write v sub x is equal
to 10 cosine of 30 degrees

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.610
times-- that's the degrees
--times the unit vector i--

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.070
let me stay in that color, so
you don't confused --times the

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.420
unit vector i.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.010
Does that make sense?

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.970
Well, the unit vector i goes in
the exact same direction.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.980
But the x component of this
vector is just a lot longer.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.630
It's 10 cosine 30
degrees long.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.080
And that's equal to-- cosine of
30 degrees is square root

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:11.580
of 3/2 --so that's 5 square
roots of 3 i.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:18.150
Similary, we can write the y
component of this vector as

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.400
some multiple of j.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.490
So we could say v sub y, the y
component-- Well, what is sine

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.250
of 30 degrees?

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.400
Sine of 30 degrees is 1/2.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.470
1/2 times 10, so this is 5.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.740
So the y component goes
completely in the y direction.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.880
So it's just going to be a
multiple of this vector j, of

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.410
the unit vector j.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:45.350
And what multiple is it?

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.240
Well, it has length 5,
while the unit vector

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.550
has just length 1.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.590
So it's just 5 times
the unit vector j.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.240
So how can we write vector v?

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.030
Well, we know the vector v is
the sum of its x component and

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.930
its y component.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.840
And we also know, so this
is a whole vector v.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.880
What's its x component?

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.130
Its x component can be
written as a multiple

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.710
of the x unit vector.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.490
That's that right there.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.080
So you can write it as
5 square roots of 3

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.330
i plus its y component.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.530
So what's its y component?

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.880
Well, its y component is just
a multiple of the y unit

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.160
vector, which is called
j, with the little

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.680
funny hat on top.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.730
And that's just this.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.050
It's 5 times j.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.770
So what we've done now, by
defining these unit vectors--

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.390
And I can switch this
color just so you

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.640
remember this is i.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.450
This unit vector is this.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.860
Using unit vectors in two
dimensions, and we can

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.140
eventually do them in multiple
dimensions, we can

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:55.130
analytically express any
two dimensional vector.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.680
Instead of having to always draw
it like we did before,

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.710
and having to break out
its components and

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:01.810
always do it visually.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.660
We can stay in analytical mode
and non graphical mode.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.930
And what makes this very useful
is that if I can write

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.480
a vector in this format, I can
add them and subtract them

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:18.830
without having to resort
to visual means.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.080
And what do I mean by that?

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.710
So if I had to find some vector
a, is equal to, I don't

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:33.870
know, 2i plus 3j.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:37.980
And I have some other
vector b.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.980
This little arrow just
means it's a vector.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.409
Sometimes you'll see it
as a whole arrow.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:52.800
As, I don't know, 10i plus 2j.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.080
If I were to say what's
the sum of these two

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.650
vectors a plus b?

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.460
Before we had this unit vector
notation, we would have to

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.320
draw them, and put them
heads to tails.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.300
And you had to do it visually,
and it would take

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:04.870
you a lot of time.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.580
But once you have it broken up
into the x and y components,

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.170
you can just separately add
the x and y components.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:18.330
So vector a plus vector b,
that's just 2 plus 10 times i

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.660
plus 3 plus 2 times j.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:27.820
And that's equal
to 12i plus 5j.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.790
And something you might want to
do, maybe I'll do it in the

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.820
future video, is actually draw
out these two vectors and add

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:33.420
them visually.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:37.210
And you'll see that you
get this exact answer.

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:40.050
And as we go into further
videos, or future videos,

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.590
you'll see how this is super
useful once we start doing

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.090
more complicated physics
problems, or once we start

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.140
doing physics with calculus.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.840
Anyway, I'm about to run out
of time on the ten minutes.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.090
So I'll see you in
the next video.
