[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.159 --> 00:00:06.710
LESLEY KATZEN: Welcome, Michele.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.400
MICHELE FILGATE:
Thank you, Lesley.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.650
LESLEY KATZEN: You're welcome.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.940
So I want to say
congratulations.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:13.940
MICHELE FILGATE: Thanks.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.460
LESLEY KATZEN: This
is a phenomenal book.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.440
I didn't know really
what to expect.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.720
I had read your
Longreads essay, and I

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.140
had gotten a couple of
stories into the anthology,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:31.460
and I am just completely floored
by how the number of writers

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.790
you have, how talented they are.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.970
Writers that I hadn't known who
they were but then looked them

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.520
up afterwards and realized
how well-known they were.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.635
And I thought it was
a very powerful book.

00:00:44.635 --> 00:00:45.760
MICHELE FILGATE: Thank you.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.240
LESLEY KATZEN: You're welcome.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.599
Let me get my questions out.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.910
So tell me a little
bit about your process.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.040
I know that you are a
writer and an editor

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.330
and when the Longreads
essay came out,

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.730
tell me about what happened
in getting the book deal

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.730
and what you did to choose
the writers that you chose,

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.570
how you approached
them in that process.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:09.487
MICHELE FILGATE: Sure.

00:01:09.487 --> 00:01:11.200
So a little bit of
background first

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.560
is that the essay that
inspired this anthology

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.870
is way over a decade
in the making.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.960
I started writing it when
I was an undergraduate.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.300
And when I first
started writing it,

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.200
it was an essay about my
stepfather being abusive.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.140
And it took me many years
to realize that actually

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.320
what this essay was about was
about a longing for a better

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.510
relationship with my
mother and the fracture

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.970
that this abuse caused
in our relationship.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.430
So when the essay
was published--

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.910
it came out in October of 2017,
right when the MeToo movement

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.960
really took off--

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.490
and so many people
responded to my essay

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.333
but also to the
title of the essay,

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:52.000
"What My Mother And
I Don't Talk About."

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.020
I kept hearing from so
many people who said,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.860
I have my own story of what I
can't talk about with my mom.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.500
And so it was really
important to me

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.250
when I was putting
this anthology together

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.380
to have a diversity of not just
writers but different types

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.360
of relationships between
mothers and children.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.930
So it's not just mothers
and daughters in this book.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.480
There are mothers and sons also.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.700
And some of the
people who are writing

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.950
are writing about mothers
who are no longer alive.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.690
Some people are
estranged from their mom.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.490
Some people are really
close with their mothers.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.610
So we have a wide swath
here of representation.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.120
And I reached out
to a lot of writers

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.820
that I admire to see if
they were brave enough

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.910
to write about what they can't
talk about with their moms.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.800
And the result is
this book, which

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.670
has some of my favorite writers
in it like Alexander Chee, who

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.282
is a well-known novelist and
also his essay collection

00:02:45.282 --> 00:02:47.740
that came out last year was
one of the biggest of the year.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.020
He was featured in
"Time" magazine.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.520
That essay collection
is called "How

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.120
To Write An
Autobiographical Novel."

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.030
He wrote a fantastic
essay about being sexually

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.590
abused as a choirboy and
not telling his mother

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.280
because he wanted to protect
her and the silence that that

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.660
caused.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.220
But then there's
some funny pieces

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.670
in here too, like Cathi
Hanauer, who actually

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.580
is the editor of a mega
bestseller anthology called

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.440
"The Bitch In The House."

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.697
And she wrote about her father
being like really domineering

00:03:22.697 --> 00:03:25.030
and how she could never have
a conversation with her mom

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.380
without her dad chiming
in all the time.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.960
So that one is a
very humorous piece.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.550
So we've got a wide
range of things.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.470
And it was important to me to
get as many different writers

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.540
and stories in here
as possible and not

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.950
have it just be
a depressing book

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.270
but have some uplifting
essays as well.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.270
LESLEY KATZEN: I think
that's one of the things,

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.630
as I go from essay to
essay, I feel like laughing

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.520
and then the next
one I'm gasping,

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.310
like, those two especially.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.340
I think that I see a
lot of mother figures

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.470
reflected in a lot of
different types of mothers

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.100
in these books.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.400
And I related to those
two essays specifically.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.900
Yeah.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.600
Oh, speaking of Alexander
Chee, so a lot of that essay

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.530
has to do with how he prepared
his mother for writing

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.430
the book.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.250
And I'm wondering, did you
talk to your mother at all

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.570
before the Longreads
essay was published?

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.577
MICHELE FILGATE: No.

00:04:15.577 --> 00:04:17.660
LESLEY KATZEN: So tell me
a little bit about that.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.829
MICHELE FILGATE: Yeah.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.332
So I know some writers who
will not publish anything

00:04:22.332 --> 00:04:24.790
without telling the person that
they're writing about first

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.100
or waiting until
the person is dead.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.020
And I completely respect that.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.830
In my case, I knew that
my mother would not

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.510
be happy with this essay.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.120
And I didn't want to
feel further silenced.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.120
I felt like this was an
important story to tell,

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.240
that it was a story that
could help a lot of people.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.050
So my mother found out after the
fact, after the essay was out,

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.240
and after I got the book deal.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.830
And so that's really hard.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.090
It's been very complicated.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.510
And I'm hoping we'll be able
to talk about it at some point.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.787
But it's been extremely
difficult. So it's sad.

00:04:58.787 --> 00:04:59.620
LESLEY KATZEN: Yeah.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.120
I mean, all of these
stories I think

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.380
are incredibly brave to tell.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.600
I mean, there's
a reason why it's

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.337
called "Fifteen Writers
Breaking The Silence."

00:05:07.337 --> 00:05:08.630
MICHELE FILGATE: Yes.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:09.130
Yeah.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.963
LESLEY KATZEN: Yeah.

00:05:09.963 --> 00:05:11.560
So you also
mentioned that MeToo.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.780
So this happened at
the same time as MeToo

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.810
or was this what compelled you
to actually write it down and--

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:18.850
MICHELE FILGATE: No.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.710
So I was working on the
essay for well over a decade.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.730
And then it just happened that
my editor at Longreads, Sari

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.350
Botton had accepted the essay,
I think, in September of 2017.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.847
And then the Weinstein story
broke, and when that broke,

00:05:31.847 --> 00:05:34.180
she was like we're moving
this up, because originally it

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.460
wasn't going to come
out until Thanksgiving.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.067
And instead, it
came out that week.

00:05:38.067 --> 00:05:40.150
So it was really published
during a crucial moment

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.560
when people were finally ready
to break silences about things.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.090
But there's all
kinds of silences

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.580
that are broken in this book.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.730
Like I said, it's
not just abuse.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.925
One of my favorite piece--

00:05:54.925 --> 00:05:56.800
I mean, they're all my
favorite, but I really

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.810
love this piece that
Lesley Jamison wrote

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.140
that I close the book with,
because it's such a nice note

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.800
to end on.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.240
It's about how she's
so close to her mother,

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.460
and she wanted to understand
who her mother was

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:10.960
before she became her mom.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.490
I think a lot of
us try to imagine

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.210
what our mom was like
before she became the mother

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.900
figure, right?

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.720
And it's hard to
imagine her without us.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.600
And she reads an
unpublished manuscript

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.487
that her mother's first husband
wrote based on their marriage.

00:06:26.487 --> 00:06:27.800
LESLEY KATZEN: Oh, boy.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.415
MICHELE FILGATE: So that is
a really interesting essay.

00:06:31.415 --> 00:06:33.790
LESLEY KATZEN: One of the
things that I had kind of noted

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.645
to myself was that despite there
are some really sad stories

00:06:38.645 --> 00:06:41.020
here, but overall, I think it
paints a really sympathetic

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.430
view of mothers.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.375
And it does seem like
all of the writers do--

00:06:47.375 --> 00:06:49.750
I'm trying to think if there
are any-- there are probably

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.270
some exceptions,
but do kind of take

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.070
a sympathetic view
of their own mothers

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.360
and cut them a lot of
slack in the things

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.560
that they lacked in growing up.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.580
MICHELE FILGATE: Yes.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.330
LESLEY KATZEN: OK.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.300
I've got some Oprah-y
questions here for you.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.680
MICHELE FILGATE: Go ahead.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.093
LESLEY KATZEN: OK?

00:07:05.093 --> 00:07:06.075
MICHELE FILGATE: Yeah.

00:07:06.075 --> 00:07:07.060
LESLEY KATZEN: OK.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.310
So you say that mothers are
idealized as protectors.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.720
In compiling all of these
stories and reading all of them

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.760
and doing all this
exploration, do

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.138
you think it's fair
to idealize mothers?

00:07:18.138 --> 00:07:19.180
MICHELE FILGATE: I don't.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.170
In fact, the "Los Angeles
Times" review of this book

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.260
talks about how this is a
book about allowing mothers

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.760
to be imperfect.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.630
And I think that we--

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.760
I talk about this in the
introduction to the book.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.940
But I think that we try to--

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.500
no one can check all the boxes
as the perfect mom, right?

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.300
Mothers are humans too.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.920
And this book is
an attempt to show

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.930
that by mythologizing them,
that can be dangerous--

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.940
false mythologies around them.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.550
So I think this is
a way of new stories

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.510
to look at moms in the light
of mothers can be complicated,

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.460
just like any human being.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.070
And taking them
off that pedestal

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.477
and talking about
them as a human being.

00:08:03.477 --> 00:08:04.310
LESLEY KATZEN: Yeah.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:07.450
I mean, I always say I
recently became a mother.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.500
It's been about five years now.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.320
And it's just not fair, man.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.010
I tell you.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:16.810
You can't be everything
all of the time.

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:18.310
And as everybody
will tell you, it's

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.630
like you're going to end
up doing something that

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:24.240
is going to make your daughter
or son write an essay about you

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.078
at some point, I
think, in your life.

00:08:26.078 --> 00:08:27.120
MICHELE FILGATE: Exactly.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.453
LESLEY KATZEN: I mean, you know.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.370
Why do you think, in
your essay specifically,

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.429
there are a couple of
instances that you talk

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:41.000
about your mother's lack of
compassion or understanding

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.250
of you, yet you have a
teacher who reaches out

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.250
to you who understands
what you're going through

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.960
and seems sympathetic
or you have,

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.760
I think, it was an
ambulance driver,

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:55.730
who kind of are able to protect
you and give you the comfort

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.020
that you need.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.080
Why do you think it was
so hard for your mother

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.670
to give you those things and
so much easier for a stranger?

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:06.920
MICHELE FILGATE:
I think because--

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.720
I think it comes down to denial.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:15.030
I think abuse causes
denial in relationships.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.980
And I think for my mother to
admit that her husband was

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.810
abusive to me, it
would shatter what

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:24.560
her view is of her marriage
and of her home and her family.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.040
And so I think
that's why I'm always

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.550
kind of seeking out mother
figures all around me, right?

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:35.450
Like, anyone who can be
nurturing or maternal.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.970
And it's not to say that my
mom hasn't been maternal.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.000
There are parts of her
that are wonderful,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.220
and I talk a lot in the
book about her cooking

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.750
and how that's
something that makes

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.740
me feel really close to her.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:50.210
But again, getting back to
that idea of our mothers

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.280
can't check all the
boxes, you know,

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.130
some mothers can't provide
that nurturing that we need.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:10:00.360
And so we also need to kind
of learn to mother ourselves.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.060
And that's something that I've
been thinking about a lot,

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.610
in not just editing this book
but talking about the book

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:10.420
and in my own life.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.632
LESLEY KATZEN: Yeah.

00:10:11.632 --> 00:10:13.840
I feel like I've heard that
a lot recently too, like,

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.450
learn to mother yourself or
especially I know that Mother's

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.695
Day, which is coming up--

00:10:17.695 --> 00:10:18.570
MICHELE FILGATE: Yep.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.528
LESLEY KATZEN: --pretty
impression on the book,

00:10:20.528 --> 00:10:22.650
but I hear that a
lot for people who

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.900
are estranged of their
mothers, that they take the day

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:29.135
to kind of be the mother to
themselves that they never had.

00:10:29.135 --> 00:10:30.010
MICHELE FILGATE: Yes.

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:32.700
LESLEY KATZEN: It's easy to--

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.200
yeah.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.750
It's easy to stay bitter, but I
think that just if you have a--

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.492
OK, obviously, not all the
people in the anthology

00:10:40.492 --> 00:10:42.450
have a strained relationship
with their mother,

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.650
but I think at some
point you do have

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:49.470
to give yourself what you need.

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:50.440
MICHELE FILGATE: Yes.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.670
Absolutely.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.800
And speaking of
Mother's Day, I think

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.810
the commercialization
of that holiday

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:59.260
makes it really hard for people,
because we're kind of inundated

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:03.550
on social media on that day with
tributes to people's mothers.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.740
And like anything
on social media,

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.090
it's a curated experience.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:10.132
So you don't see what
the complications

00:11:10.132 --> 00:11:11.590
are in the relationship
that person

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:12.700
might have with their mom.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.150
And those of us who
have felt unmothered

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:20.440
or who have never had our mother
around or who are estranged,

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.030
it's such a hard day.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.662
Or people who have
lost their mother,

00:11:23.662 --> 00:11:25.120
their mother passed
away, and there

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.780
are some people in this
book who write about that.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.820
That day, Mother's
Day in particular,

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:34.060
can just be so
difficult. So I think

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.580
this is actually the
perfect book to read around

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.150
Mother's Day for self-care.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.650
LESLEY KATZEN: It definitely
brought a lot of these feelings

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.300
to process a couple of weeks
before as I was reading it.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:44.800
OK.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.640
So I've heard this--

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.070
I think it was the NPR
review of this book--

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:49.830
and I wanted to hear
your take on it.

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:52.660
This is kind of like,
but why are mothers

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.280
so different than fathers?

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.728
Why not things my father
and I don't talk about?

00:11:56.728 --> 00:11:58.270
I kind of know the
answer here, but I

00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:59.957
want to hear your response.

00:11:59.957 --> 00:12:01.540
MICHELE FILGATE: I
think it's because,

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.670
for most of us, obviously
not every mother--

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.320
I'm talking about
the bio mothers,

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.850
for our biological mothers,
we grow inside of them, right?

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:12.010
And so there's a body--

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:15.520
there's a corporeal attachment
there that you can't deny.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.628
And I think that that makes
it so much more complicated.

00:12:19.628 --> 00:12:20.170
I don't know.

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.328
Obviously, people
have plenty of stories

00:12:22.328 --> 00:12:24.370
to tell about their
relationships with their dads

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:25.060
too.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.340
And I could see that as
a whole other anthology,

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.130
although I'm very
close with my father.

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.410
But I think that
for mothers, there's

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:34.690
just something primal there.

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.880
There's something that--
like, we're always--

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.440
I talk about this in my essay.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.800
The very beginning of
my essay is our mothers

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.323
are our first homes.

00:12:43.323 --> 00:12:44.740
And that's why
we're always trying

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:47.590
to return to them to have
a place where we belong

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:49.210
or where we fit.

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:52.120
And I think that's so true.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.150
And if we no longer fit
there, what does that mean?

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.230
Right?

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:59.420
So there's just--
it's more intense,

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.800
the mother-child relationship
than the father-child

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.300
in some ways,
although I know plenty

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.480
of people who have had intense
relationships with their dads

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.002
too.

00:13:09.002 --> 00:13:10.510
LESLEY KATZEN: Yeah.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:11.710
That really struck me too.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:14.987
It's like, your first home
and your first relationship

00:13:14.987 --> 00:13:15.820
is with your mother.

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:16.695
MICHELE FILGATE: Yes.

00:13:16.695 --> 00:13:20.140
LESLEY KATZEN: I mean, or
with your biological mother.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:20.690
Yeah.

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:24.120
It's kind of a trip
just to think about.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.710
Michele, Melissa Febos--

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.255
I almost said Michele Febos--

00:13:28.255 --> 00:13:29.260
but I love her.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.700
And I'm glad--

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.140
I loved her essay so much.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.270
She kind of got a little
bit to Greek mythology

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:37.935
in the relationship between
Demeter and Persephone.

00:13:37.935 --> 00:13:38.810
MICHELE FILGATE: Yes.

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:40.060
LESLEY KATZEN: I loved that.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.530
So she says that
all children are

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.150
built to be loved but
not all parents need it.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:47.750
And you've spoken to her,
I think, about the essay,

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:49.600
but I think you
also did recently

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.810
talk with her on this book.

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:53.320
So maybe y0ou have
some insight in it.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.990
Do you think that she
equates protection with love?

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.090
Her essays a lot
about her mother

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:00.955
bailing her out of things or
protecting her from the world.

00:14:00.955 --> 00:14:01.830
MICHELE FILGATE: Yes.

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:03.360
Yeah.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.038
I think so.

00:14:04.038 --> 00:14:05.830
I mean, I'm curious to
hear what you think.

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:06.913
Do you think she protects?

00:14:06.913 --> 00:14:08.462
She equates that?

00:14:08.462 --> 00:14:09.670
LESLEY KATZEN: Yeah, I think.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:12.290
I think that's probably
why I asked you.

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:13.690
MICHELE FILGATE: Yeah.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:18.730
I mean, that essay in particular
is really interesting because,

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:22.120
like you said, it
looks at mythology

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.940
as a prism of a way to describe
her close-knit relationship

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:26.710
with her psychotherapist mother.

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.710
So it's already pretty
powerful that her own mom

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.960
is a psychotherapist.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.610
But yeah, I think in that
essay, Melissa really

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:38.620
makes herself very
vulnerable on the page,

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.203
because she talks about when she
was going through some really

00:14:41.203 --> 00:14:42.490
difficult times in her life.

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.900
And she kind of puts it
all out there, right?

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:52.190
And yeah, I do think that
protection in some ways,

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:55.910
but also you have to
kind of learn how to--

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:58.340
I think there's like a
duality there, right?

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.710
Because she also
was feeling like she

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:03.330
had to protect her
mom in some ways.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:04.220
So it kind of--

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.697
I think there's a duality there.

00:15:05.697 --> 00:15:07.280
LESLEY KATZEN: I
like that especially,

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.770
because I think about
my personal relationship

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:11.660
with my mother, and I
have multiple mother

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.460
figures in my life too.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.170
But it was a contentious one.

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:18.500
I related to her essay and
then a couple of other essays

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:19.040
in the book.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.830
And I thought to
myself, you know,

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.180
this is a mother who
really is a psychologist.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.980
She's doing all of
the right things,

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.890
but still realizes
in this, again,

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:31.850
through the prism of this
mother-daughter relationship

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:35.750
and mythology, realizes that
the daughter has to go off and--

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:36.725
MICHELE FILGATE: Yes.

00:15:36.725 --> 00:15:38.850
LESLEY KATZEN:
--identify herself.

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:40.630
And that was a
difficult one for me

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.530
to read, just knowing
that that's something

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:43.738
that has to happen, you know?

00:15:43.738 --> 00:15:44.780
MICHELE FILGATE: It does.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:45.440
It does.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.023
LESLEY KATZEN: It's
a natural process.

00:15:47.023 --> 00:15:50.160
I guess I should feel
better about that.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.952
So I have a couple just like
last questions to wrap up,

00:15:53.952 --> 00:15:55.910
and then we'll take
questions from the audience

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:59.360
and then do a signing.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.110
Why do you think--

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:01.777
a lot of these stories
are about mothers

00:16:01.777 --> 00:16:04.700
having secrets and
these secrets only

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:08.210
being revealed because
of something catastrophic

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:10.780
or upon their deathbed.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.627
And why do you think that
mothers have so many secrets?

00:16:13.627 --> 00:16:15.710
MICHELE FILGATE: Because
most humans have secrets.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.085
LESLEY KATZEN:
That's true, yeah.

00:16:17.085 --> 00:16:18.020
I'll give you that.

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.270
MICHELE FILGATE: I'm glad
you brought that up, though,

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:22.430
because I think there are
some great essays in here

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:23.720
that deal with that.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.450
In particular, Dylan
Landis writes about

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:29.270
after her mother died,
trying to imagine

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:32.150
her mother's potential romantic
relationship with a very

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.620
famous painter.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.960
And she enters the
imaginative realm of, like,

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.820
actually going there
and trying to write

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.237
about what it would
have been like

00:16:39.237 --> 00:16:41.240
if her mom did have this
romantic relationship

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.370
with Haywood Bill Rivers.

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:46.010
And then there's a piece
by Julianna Baggott

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.870
that's really funny about her
mom telling her everything.

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.640
So not keeping secrets
but telling her--

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:56.360
she was the person that her
mother confessed everything to

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.880
and what that means to
carry all of that around.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.082
LESLEY KATZEN: It's heavy.

00:17:01.082 --> 00:17:02.540
MICHELE FILGATE:
But yeah, secrets.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:05.150
I mean, all of us have them.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.930
So of course, mothers have them.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:09.097
I think it's just
a primal thing of--

00:17:09.097 --> 00:17:10.805
LESLEY KATZEN:
Protection, love, secrets.

00:17:10.805 --> 00:17:11.108
MICHELE FILGATE: Yes.

00:17:11.108 --> 00:17:11.608
Yeah.

00:17:11.608 --> 00:17:13.390
LESLEY KATZEN: Trying
to protect children

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:14.180
from the realities of life.

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:14.495
MICHELE FILGATE: Of course.

00:17:14.495 --> 00:17:17.102
Well, that's the other thing is
not revealing your full selves

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:17.810
to your children.

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:21.230
Not showing that you
are fallible, right?

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:22.730
LESLEY KATZEN: Was
it Dylan Landis--

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:24.980
is that her name-- that was
one of my favorites as well.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:25.339
MICHELE FILGATE: Yeah.

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:26.630
LESLEY KATZEN: It
was a fascinating--

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:27.329
MICHELE FILGATE: It's so good.

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:28.230
LESLEY KATZEN: 16 Moneta--

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:29.145
MICHELE FILGATE: 16 Moneta Lane.

00:17:29.145 --> 00:17:29.440
LESLEY KATZEN: So good.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:29.750
MICHELE FILGATE: Yeah.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:31.040
That's the one
about the painter.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:31.873
LESLEY KATZEN: Yeah.

00:17:31.873 --> 00:17:33.500
MICHELE FILGATE:
It's really good.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.250
LESLEY KATZEN: OK.

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.125
So we talked a little
bit about Mother's Day,

00:17:36.125 --> 00:17:38.810
and this will be
my last question.

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:41.560
What would you say to somebody
who hasn't read the book yet

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.030
but was thinking about giving
it as a Mother's Day gift?

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.530
MICHELE FILGATE: I
would say that it

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:48.710
makes the perfect Mother's
Day gift, because it's not

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.480
overly sentimental.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:54.110
But it is really-- like, there
is a lot about hope and love

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:55.230
in here too.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.840
And it allows for some really
important conversations

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:58.340
to have.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.020
And I've already
heard from people

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.510
who are buying it
for their children

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.240
so that they can have
these conversations that

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.843
are so difficult to have.

00:18:06.843 --> 00:18:08.510
LESLEY KATZEN: The
first thing I thought

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:10.520
was I was going to get
these for my sister.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.230
My mother, I'm not so sure.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:13.850
But I might end up doing that.

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:16.950
So thank you so much for
answering all these questions.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:18.410
It's lovely to have you here.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:19.520
I love the book.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.310
MICHELE FILGATE:
Thank you, Lesley.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.150
And does anybody
have any questions?

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:26.900
AUDIENCE: So the main
reason that I'm here

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.200
is I have two daughters, a
12-year-old and a 5-year-old.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.850
And my mom passed
away four years ago,

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.260
and she was sick for a while.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.110
So we got to have really
good conversations

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.025
around how I treated
her growing up

00:18:38.025 --> 00:18:39.650
and how she treated
me, how things went

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:41.700
growing up for us, basically.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.380
And I guess the
thing that I'm hoping

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:48.110
you might have some insight,
based on your research,

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:51.650
how do I try to help have
even better communication

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:53.425
lines with my own daughters?

00:18:53.425 --> 00:18:54.800
I don't know if
you have children

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.660
or not, but like
maybe in your research

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.688
you found information that--

00:18:58.688 --> 00:19:00.230
I'm here for my
daughters, basically.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:04.250
I'd like to foster
that relationship.

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:05.840
MICHELE FILGATE:
That's wonderful.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.630
I think-- you know, I
don't have kids of my own.

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:12.050
But I do feel like I've immersed
myself in this very much

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:13.430
by editing this anthology.

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:16.760
And I think the
main thing is to not

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.160
be afraid to have these
difficult conversations,

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.550
anything that you feel like
you're not sure how to approach

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:24.140
in telling your
children or talking

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.050
about with your children, to
not let the fear stop you.

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:30.680
Because so often, fear is what
stop-- it paralyzes us, right?

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:34.040
And sometimes the most
important conversations

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.740
we can have come out
of something that we're

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.210
afraid to talk about.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:41.240
So I would say to
push past that fear,

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.460
like, force yourself
to push past it,

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:47.310
In order to have clear
open communication.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.960
But also, it might be good to--
even if you're not a writer--

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.420
to just write some things
down that you want to talk

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.710
to about your kids first.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:56.260
That might really help
you just kind of figure

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.170
out what it is that you
are afraid to talk about

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:02.210
and what you want to
articulate with them.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:03.280
But I-- yeah.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.490
I don't know if that
answers your question.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:07.387
No problem.

00:20:07.387 --> 00:20:08.470
AUDIENCE: So I'm curious--

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:11.100
I mean, it seems like essays
like this would really

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.100
spark a lot of emotions.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.850
And I'm curious if since
you've released this

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:18.510
if you've received even more
interest and reader's stories

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:19.330
and if you--

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:20.620
basically, is there a sequel?

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.540
I mean, I was just
sitting here thinking,

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.900
I can think of at least
one personal story and one

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.550
story I'm directly involved in.

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:32.470
And I just imagine that that's
the case with a lot of folks.

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:34.270
Are there plans for
a sequel or are you

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:37.600
getting lots of reader
interest and contribution

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.710
or more writers
wanting to be involved?

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:41.210
MICHELE FILGATE: Well it-- yeah.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:41.710
Thank you.

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:42.668
That's a good question.

00:20:42.668 --> 00:20:43.900
It just came out.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.910
So there are no plans
for a sequel right now.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:48.970
But I have been hearing
from so many people who

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:53.053
have read the book, strangers
who say that they can relate

00:20:53.053 --> 00:20:54.970
to something they read
in here, that it really

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:57.190
made them feel less alone.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:02.487
I heard from one person who
is estranged from their child

00:21:02.487 --> 00:21:04.570
and felt like there's no
other book out there that

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.160
can help her with that.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.270
And so that meant a lot to me.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:10.300
It always means a
lot to me to hear

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.640
from anyone who's had any
kind of emotional response

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.480
to the book.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:17.350
But I think, like you said,
people respond to this title.

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:19.100
Everyone can think
of their own stories.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.550
So I'm hoping that
people will be encouraged

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:24.130
to share these stories with
their friends, their loved

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:27.430
ones, and keep the
conversation going

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:30.421
or start a conversation
to begin with.

00:21:30.421 --> 00:21:32.500
LESLEY KATZEN: I will
say, after I read it,

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:36.260
I wanted to just write you,
like confessional stories of all

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:36.760
of my--

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.600
it did have an effect on me.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:40.870
MICHELE FILGATE: Yeah.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:41.590
It's really hard.

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:43.090
I teach creative
nonfiction, and one

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:44.715
of the first things
I teach my students

00:21:44.715 --> 00:21:47.090
is to write from a place
of shame or vulnerability,

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:51.440
because that's often where
some of the best stories are.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.940
And another thing,
Melissa Febos who

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:55.490
we were talking about before,
I was just on a panel with her.

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:57.032
And one of the things
she talks about

00:21:57.032 --> 00:22:00.733
is not making yourself always,
like, the hero in whatever

00:22:00.733 --> 00:22:01.900
you're writing about, right?

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.420
But showing yourself as
a flawed person as well,

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.210
because we all are
flawed people, right?

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:11.268
And so I think about that
a lot when I'm writing.

00:22:11.268 --> 00:22:12.310
LESLEY KATZEN: All right.

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:14.873
Well, Michele will be
signing some books.

00:22:14.873 --> 00:22:16.040
Thanks for coming, everyone.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.165
MICHELE FILGATE: Thank you.

00:22:17.165 --> 00:22:19.080
[APPLAUSE]
