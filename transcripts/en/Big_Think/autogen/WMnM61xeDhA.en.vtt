taking risks and that's a mark of
 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.800
taking risks and that's a mark of

new Schewel this is that we're willing
to take chances and too few communities

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379
to take chances and too few communities
 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:43.080
to take chances and too few communities
are willing to go there

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090
 
 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.820
 
because so many of our members come from

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.470
because so many of our members come from
the arts community and that that's

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480
the arts community and that that's
 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.940

Pollock were running around so I think

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800
Pollock were running around so I think
 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.130
Pollock were running around so I think
that one of the things we've realized is

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140
that one of the things we've realized is
 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.470
that one of the things we've realized is
that it's very hard to put on a kind and

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480
that it's very hard to put on a kind and
 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.520
that it's very hard to put on a kind and
many of our members coming from the

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530
many of our members coming from the
 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.880
many of our members coming from the
theater community to kind of put on a

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890
theater community to kind of put on a
 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.010
theater community to kind of put on a
religious ritual that feels like a

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020
religious ritual that feels like a
 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.200
religious ritual that feels like a
production and yet also feels

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210
production and yet also feels
 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.380
production and yet also feels
religiously authentic it's very tricky

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390
religiously authentic it's very tricky
 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.680
religiously authentic it's very tricky
and unless you have professionals who

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690
and unless you have professionals who
 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.250
and unless you have professionals who
are doing it it sometimes cannot be as

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260
are doing it it sometimes cannot be as
 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.100
are doing it it sometimes cannot be as
effective as it might be so I would say

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110
effective as it might be so I would say
 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.080
