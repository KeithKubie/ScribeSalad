00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.370
On Discovery.com, I learned that most meteors
burn up in Earth's atmosphere.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.980
AHH the ATMOSPHERE!

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:07.980
AHhhhhh! ahhhhh.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:16.789
// But what happens to those that don't?

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:17.939
Hello Meteor.

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:19.570
Trace here for DNews.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.449
Meteors and missiles can hit the ground with
massive force.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.289
The 1908 Tunguska Impact in Siberia flattened
2,000 square kilometers of Russian forest

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.370
with an explosion 1,000 times greater than
the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.001
The meteor left a crater, likely created local
firestorms raised by superheated air, and

00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:42.680
particles from the impact may have cooled
Earth's climate,!

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.050
Tiny things hit planet Earth all the time,
but they're usually not fast enough or large

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.390
enough to worry anyone.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.800
Observations from satellites suggest anywhere
from 1 to 300 metric tons of dust hit the

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.400
Earth, every.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.400
day.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.640
Assuming 100 tons, evenly across the whole
surface we'd gain around point zero two nanometers

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.930
every year to the radius of our planet.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.230
You can see some of these things as they fly
through the atmosphere - anything over 2 millimeters

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.010
in size can create a streak of friction-spawned
burnup.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.810
We call them shooting stars, but they're just
dust and bits of rock.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.409
If a meteoroid is large enough to make it
through our atmosphere and dent the solid

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.270
surface of our planet -- at least the size
of a marble -- then it gets real.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.110
Most of us know what happens to the stuff
ON the surface, destruction, dust clouds,

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.570
etc; but new research from Duke University
simulated high-speed impacts on sand and soil

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.690
so now we know what happens UNDER the surface
too.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.040
They based it on missiles, but it works for
meteors too.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.900
When an object hits the surface at high speed
the soil doesn't move out of the way, but

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.900
actually solidifies.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.330
Think of it like a crowd of people, or a pack
of snow -- the faster you try to move through

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.190
the mass -- the more difficult it becomes.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.570
The researchers dropped a metal rod with a
rounded end onto a pack of beads designed

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.950
to simulate soil.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.750
They varied the strength of the beads to simulate
speeds from 67 to 670 miles an hour (6 to

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.829
300 m/s) and found as it sped up, more of
the beads took the force of the impact, more

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:14.779
quickly, spreading the kinetic energy over
a wide area of soil.

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:19.150
As the projectile speed increased, the particles
of soil couldn't get out of the way fast enough,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.659
When you think about it, this isn't a staggering
discovery, but it's useful for the production

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:28.099
of bunker busting missiles -- it was funded
by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency,.

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.290
AND it shows why, when a meteor hits the ground,
it doesn't just burrow into the planet.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.010
All that kinetic energy dissipates through
the soil at such a rapid rate, and creates

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.010
a blast crater.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.850
And in case you're wondering if ALL that energy
could change the orbit of our planet, Earth

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.140
is real big, y'all.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.950
We're orbiting at around 67,000 miles an hour
(108k kph) and we're quite massive.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.730
If you were to blow a 100 mile-thick (160km)
chunk of North America off the face of the

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.680
Earth; we'd only alter the Earth's momentum
by about 50 miles an hour (80kph).

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.790
Meteoroid strikes like the Tunguska event
do happen every 50 to 100 years or so, so

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.999
we'll likely see one in our lifetime!

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:10.439
And now you know what's going on both above
AND below that crater.

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:15.139
We got some awesome questions last time we
asked, so we're asking again, what do you

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:16.709
want to know about science?

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:29.260
What should we talk about in a future DNews?
