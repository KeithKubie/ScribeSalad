00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.042
-Hello, everyone.

00:00:11.042 --> 00:00:12.515
Welcome back.

00:00:12.515 --> 00:00:14.280
I hope you had a good break.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.280
My name is Janet
Rich-Edwards and I

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.100
am one of the two science
advisers to the Radcliffe

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.050
Institute here.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.800
And I want to welcome
you back for what

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.340
was a great start to
the program in a really

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.360
interesting second panel
now focused on solutions.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.380
I'm going to introduce
Anula Jayasuriya, right?

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.110
Very good.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.040
Who is the co-founder of
Evolvence India Life Science

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.980
Fund, founder of
Exclaim Capital,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.910
and I think possesses more
Harvard degrees than anyone

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.020
I've ever met.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.000
She's going to lead us off
and moderate the second panel.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.990
So, welcome.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.480
-Thank you.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.150
Thank you everyone
for being here.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.680
I'm especially delighted
to see so many young women.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.390
And we are all hoping
that we'll be talking

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.360
about is relevant for you.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.580
In case you missed
the first panel,

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.130
let me just go over
the outline here--

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.360
is that I will speak
for a very short time,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.920
each panelist will have
15 minutes to describe

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.330
their vantage point,
and then there

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.550
will be a Q&amp;A for 15
minutes afterwards.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.180
Please line up and state your
name and your affiliation

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.800
when you ask your questions.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.510
So thank you for
panel number one

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.780
for giving us a teaser
into panel number two

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.960
as we discuss solutions.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.810
And let me also first
thank Nancy Hopkins, who

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.514
is the first person who
taught me about transposons

00:01:46.514 --> 00:01:48.180
and jumping genes
when I was in college.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.298
I was a Radcliffe alumni.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.080
And then I read
the issue of nature

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.840
from 2013 where that
describes her struggle

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.560
to bring light to this topic.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.220
And today I'm delighted
to actually see her again

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.820
in person.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.030
Thank you, Nancy.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.070
And Harvard and
Radcliffe Institute,

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.440
thank you for having me here.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:21.350
Deborah gave us a suggestion
that I want to emphasize.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.390
Start practicing.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.910
Don't wait to be asked.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.430
Ask to go to the prom.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.760
Invite the person to go
to the prom with you.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.410
Don't wait to ask to be married,
ask the person to marry you.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.660
Good practice.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.290
Ask.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.130
And when you ask, expect to
see some people very surprised

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.670
and not necessarily very happy,
but be resilient and stay

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.260
to the point.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.240
I'd also want to talk
a little bit about what

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.500
Allison talked about.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.540
I brought a series of
articles and among them

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.840
was the venture investors
prefer to fund handsome men.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.420
Maybe it was
apocryphal, but there

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.680
was a follow up that said
that beautiful women were

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.300
the least likely to get funded.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.010
And so that was another part
that was quite interesting.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.640
Then I have an
economist article that's

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.140
talking about the weaker sex and
they're not referring to women.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.670
They're talking about
boys and education.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.680
So the pipeline for
high achieving men,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.770
or for men at the school
level is problematic, right?

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.450
And it's quite the opposite
in women in college

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.190
and in higher education.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.970
So that is also an
ecosystem aspect

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.200
that we have to think about.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.250
Now let's talk about boards.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.460
So again, this panel will
talk about it in more detail.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.110
But I think getting on
board is very important.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.570
Debra talked about
the two people.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.540
[? Helena ?] Morrissey, from the
financial services in Britain

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.730
is a very interesting woman.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.350
She has taken a
different point of view.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.090
You may all know about
boards in Europe,

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.519
where the Nordic countries have
required a certain number quota

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:20.850
system.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.880
And she has taken a
different point of view.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.650
She's calling it the 30% club.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.400
And she sees 30% of
board leadership women

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.970
as being the critical number.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.700
I don't know where she pull
that number out, but that is--

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.350
And her strategy is
to go to powerful men

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.310
in Britain, who are chair people
or chairmen of their boards.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.030
And make them recruit
the women onto the board.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.520
So she's taking a softer
sell, if you will,

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.540
rather than the quota system.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.570
I hesi-- I'm of two minds about
mentioning this, which she does

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.150
happen to have nine children.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.340
And she is very successful.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.050
That does astound me.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.410
Then another headline
here, female VCs,

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.150
what do entrepreneurs
really think?

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.800
So this data
suggests-- and it all

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.270
comes from the power
of perception--

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:29.900
that men and women
entrepreneurs often think

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.010
that male VCs have more power.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.220
So they prefer to be
funded by male VCs

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.310
based on this belief in power.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:50.610
And there is [INAUDIBLE] that
which is also that less than 5%

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.690
of venture
capitalists are women.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.660
And I think lots of
data on social behavior

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.680
where you like what's like you.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.830
And so it's also harder
for women entrepreneurs

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.510
to raise money.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.400
Perhaps some part
of it has to do

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.530
with it being that
it's primarily

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.800
men making the decision.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.600
Also something that I
think about a whole lot

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.080
is that it is hard for women
who are climb being the venture

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.900
capital ladder, which is a
delicate ladder for women.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.880
To espouse women,
because there's

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.260
a complex dynamic of are
you espousing these women,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.650
because you're a
woman or do you really

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.270
believe in their company?

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.350
So there are all
kinds of subtleties

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.880
that one should think about.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.690
And this article-- we just
know this-- women are not

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.320
making progress in the
male dominated VC world

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.110
as data show.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:52.840
So right there is a
pretty pervasive bias

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.170
for entrepreneurship, because
the eye of the person who's

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.490
making the judgment.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.210
And that brings me to the
unconscious bias world,

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.240
which we will hear about here.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:12.400
And that is that if the system
is geared towards measuring

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.360
one group of people
at their talents,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.530
it is fairly
unlikely to work just

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:23.040
as well in another group that
has different characteristics.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.720
And that brings me
to the economist

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.420
article from January
23rd this year,

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.570
What's holding women back?

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.670
So this study showed that
majority of Americans

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.340
said that they thought men and
women were equally capable.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.640
However, and so they believed
in meritocracy, democracy,

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.790
equality, all those
wonderful things.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:50.750
However, PS, when
it came to being

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.980
asked would you
have a woman lead,

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.170
they're using the
word viscerally.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:00.170
Viscerally, Americans resisted
letting femininity and power

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.440
go hand in hand.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:08.860
And that conclusion was
in our minds, we are open,

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.560
but at a gut level,
which is what

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.570
unconscious bias taps
into, this is a very hard

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.890
to leap for people to make.

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:25.240
And then there's the aspect
of various corporations making

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.200
statements, bold statements.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.640
For example, Intel has
appointed Renee James

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.200
and given her a
$300 million budget

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.870
to increase corporate
diversity, a lot

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.980
of it being amongst women.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:45.840
Now I live in Silicon Valley and
there is a lot of talk in tech,

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.460
not in biotech, in tech,
about getting more women

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.010
and there are bloggers who are
talking about it all the time.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.330
People judging companies
by their lack of women.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.050
A big spotlight.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.730
I may be just unaware,
but I don't believe quite

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:06.530
that level of focus has
been devoted to biotech.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:10.230
Perhaps it's because there
are more biotech CEOs and more

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.930
senior women in
biotech, but that

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.410
doesn't mean that
harsh light shouldn't

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.050
be focused on the issue.

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:20.330
So I think it would be
good to do something

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.730
that Nancy Hopkins tried to
do and should carry the baton.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:28.190
And actually talk,
blog, talk about this,

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:33.310
let people hear the
dissatisfaction with the status

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:34.600
quo.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:39.980
And suggestions might be
to give CEOs incentives

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.220
for recruiting women to board.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.870
So recruiting women
in their companies.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:52.840
There could be other ways to
make this more interesting.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:10:00.700
And I'd also share with
you this is an n of 1--

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.610
I was trained as a scientist,
but I'm now a business person

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:08.810
so I can use n of
1-- a woman who

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:14.530
had been at Genentech
and at the FDA

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.840
and also is a research
scientist said to me,

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.290
you know what I decided just
to start my own company.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:25.170
And I didn't just
start my own company,

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:30.060
I developed the relationship
with the funder.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.530
I maintained that relationship
as my relationship

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:34.400
with the funder.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.710
So that gave me power and power
was an operative word three.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.090
So enough from me.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.380
Let me introduce our
panel very briefly.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.990
We're very, very fortunate
to have a very diverse panel

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.340
representing all the
different stakeholders just

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.700
like panel one did.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.930
We have a policy expert,
a PhD biologist who's

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.530
a venture capitalist,
and then we

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:04.340
have Robin who is an academic.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:09.300
So Victoria is the
founding executive director

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.390
of women and public policy
at the Harvard Kennedy

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.690
School of Government.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:20.030
Their mission led by
Victoria is gender equality

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:24.370
to improve the lives of
women across the globe.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:27.910
Ann is the senior
director of investments

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:31.090
at Sanofi-Genzyme BioVentures.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:35.060
She has a PhD in
systems biology from MIT

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.270
and also did a post-doc.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.980
And she also went to HBS.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:45.410
Ann can speak to the
transition from PhD academia

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:50.870
and also to the role that
venture capital might play.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:52.950
In particular corporate
venture capital,

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:58.080
because there are two breeds
in venture capitalists and Ann

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.950
represents the corporate
strategic venture capitalists,

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:02.390
who are somewhat
different in what

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:05.990
they look for than the
institutional venture

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:07.050
capitalists.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:12.300
And then furthest away
from me is Robin Ely,

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:16.460
she's a professor of Business
Administration at the Harvard

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.020
Business School.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:23.160
And I had to get over saying
I went to the business school.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.100
And I got laughed at
a lot in California.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.300
Professor Ely will be
presenting research

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:34.900
on how HBS is tackling
the issue of it's

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:40.440
not so previously, not so
hospitable culture for women.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:46.700
And Dean Nohria has taken this
on as an initiative to make HBS

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.700
a more inclusive environment.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.900
And this has been led by Robin.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:57.190
So we really would like to hear
your views, Robin, on ideas.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:05.670
We will then ask each panelist
to speak for 15 minutes

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:06.960
and express their views.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.680
And then I will take
questions for 15 and then

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.290
after that it'll be your turn.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:14.970
And please come up with
lots of good questions.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:16.560
Victoria.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.540
-Thank you so much.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.870
So we've had a really robust
conversation this morning.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.840
And our entire
conversation has really

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.730
focused on how do
we navigate systems.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.590
At the women public
policy program,

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:35.750
we've been working
for nearly 20 years

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.660
not on measuring
where the gaps are.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.540
Tho we certainly do
some of that work,

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.380
but how do we
identify and define

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:47.380
a replicable interventions
to close those gaps.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.490
How do you determine what
the intervention will cost,

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:54.120
how effective it is, and
where can it be applied.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.630
This is a panel about
solutions and we're

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.010
going to talk about
where is the edge of what

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:02.970
we know about how solutions
work and how to implement them.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:06.000
My goal is over the
next 14 minutes,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.930
I will give you some
things that you can

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.130
do within your organization.

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:15.280
Now because we can't
immediately fix all the systems,

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.890
having conversations
about how to navigate them

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:22.500
is extraordinarily important
and impactful and needed.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.179
And we today are particularly
talking about gender,

00:14:25.179 --> 00:14:26.970
but I think it's very
important to remember

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.469
that what we're
really talking about

00:14:28.469 --> 00:14:32.220
is any non-traditional
actor in the system.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.120
Anyone who breaks with the
stereotypical frame and I'll

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.690
talk about that and
specificity in a few moments.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:42.090
So we had discussion in
the earlier panel about how

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.170
are women leaders perceived.

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:48.970
This is Heidi Roizen, CEO
formerly of a very significant

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:50.180
tech firm.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:53.170
There is a case written
about her for HBS.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:56.330
And some of Robin's
colleagues thought, you now

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.100
our students are reacting
to this case in such a way

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.710
that it really gives us pause.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:04.880
And they decided to take
this case about Heidi

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:10.010
and substitute Howard for Heidi.

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.660
And very similar to what
Allison talked about where

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:16.210
nothing else changes.

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:18.530
And it's a beautiful
experiment, right?

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.780
Because we have students
that we can put in one place,

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.120
and students we
can put in another.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.619
We can change it
over a time period,

00:15:23.619 --> 00:15:25.800
but keep everything the same.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:30.540
And what they found is when
the behaviors are identical,

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.890
people like Howard more.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.980
They think Howard
is a better leader.

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.610
They think they learn
more from Howard.

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:43.850
And they want to work
with Howard more.

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:46.720
Now Kathy McGinn's
work, which was that

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.860
also focused on warmth
versus competence.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.920
When Debra talked
about how people

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.080
are seen within organizations,
and when there's

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.830
lots and lots and
lots of women, it's

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:02.530
OK if there's some women who
are tough and hard and abrasive.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:04.160
And it's OK if there
are some women who

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.890
are warm and friendly.

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.730
Assume both competent.

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:13.350
And they can be viewed
as competent and.

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:16.510
But what happens when you only
have a few, which is the way

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.680
most people read our
entire cultural narrative.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.130
And let's talk about
predominantly in the west,

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.850
because that's where most
of these studies are from.

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:26.710
But the entire
cultural archetype

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:32.370
is that women are either
warm or competent.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:39.460
Either beautiful or a
really good venture VC.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:43.760
And part of what we
need to do is to create.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.280
So system.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.780
So right now we're talking
about the past as all them

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.840
and about how to
navigate the system.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.710
Navigating the system,
again, very important.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:57.990
But the future is about
designing systems such

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:00.550
that individuals don't
have to work so darn hard

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:02.580
to navigate them.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:07.150
And so that organizations don't
have to constantly operate

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:13.020
in a system set, where they
are likely to produce sameness,

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:16.770
which means they're not
capturing the talent.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:19.460
Several times it was mentioned
and I'm going to call it Debra,

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.440
again.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.099
That this isn't a problem
about equality or diversity.

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:26.970
We could have a
conversation about equality

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:30.300
and that's a really
important conversation,

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:34.600
but I myself and the women in
public policy program for 20

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.817
years I have worked
on gender issues,

00:17:36.817 --> 00:17:39.400
I work in the White House with
the Council on women and girls,

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.380
I work with the
State Department,

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.830
I work regularly with all
kinds of policy positions,

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:49.120
I share the commission on
the status of women and girls

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.320
here in the state
of Massachusetts.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.330
All day I focus on how do we
take interventions and turn

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:55.990
them into policy.

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:58.405
I almost never talked
about equality.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:04.580
When one is trying
to create change

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:09.190
and one has stakeholders,
it is very difficult

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:11.010
to convince your
stakeholders that you

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:13.390
should take your eye
off the ball for what

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.570
you're required to do.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.380
Take your eye off performance
measures and outcomes

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.090
that you will need to
present and perform on.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:23.660
Turn your time and attention
to an issue which may not

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.540
impact you in
direct ways that you

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.490
can understand to solve
a problem that I believe

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:31.610
is important that
isn't on your list.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.400
Do we agreed that
sounds like a hard sell?

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:39.340
What is incredibly
strategically effective

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.810
for organizational change,
an organizational design,

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.160
is to understand what
is the main mission

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.000
of that organization.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.670
What are the key problems
that they need to solve.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:54.100
What interventions
do I have that

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:58.840
I can convey that a replicable
and ideally inexpensive that

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.510
can solve a problem that is on
someone's list to enable them

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:04.570
to reach their main mission.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:08.400
And that is the future
organizational design

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.130
and closing gender gaps.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:12.170
And I'm going to give
you a few examples today

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:16.750
and then I'm happy to take Q&amp;A
about them or any other topics.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:22.870
And we often draw upon
behavioral insights.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:27.630
Now does anyone know
what that picture is of?

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:29.120
Someone said it.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.170
Say it loud.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.170
Nice work.

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:34.580
Petrified wood.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.380
Now we talked today
about how few women

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.890
are at the top of that pyramid.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.760
And everyone in their mind
can see that catalyst pyramid

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.270
with just a few
women at the C-suite.

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:46.740
And then the number
of women broadens out

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.770
as that pyramid goes down
into the lower levels.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:51.250
One of the things
that we do when

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:54.140
we talk about how
bad it is-- and I've

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:56.490
been showing that pyramid
for years so I'm culpable.

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:58.360
I'm in the tank.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.460
One of the things that we do
is we normalize behaviors.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.240
Now I show you a piece of the
Petrified Forest, because years

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:08.030
ago they used to have signs up.

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:10.340
Has anyone actually been there?

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.060
OK.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.050
You may recall it.

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:16.910
Signs that would say,
please stay on the path.

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:22.760
Do not go off the path and
put pieces of Petrified Forest

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.870
in your pocket.

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:27.210
Four tons of the
Petrified Forest

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:32.740
leaves every year in small
pieces that people gather.

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.170
Now what happened
with these signs

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:40.580
is that the number of tons
of missing Petrified Forest

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:41.412
did what?

00:20:41.412 --> 00:20:41.912
-Went up.

00:20:41.912 --> 00:20:42.620
-Increased.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.680
-It rose, because they
literally gave us step

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.470
by step guide of how to take it.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:53.210
And most importantly they
said, everyone is doing it.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:58.020
And what we need to now do--
there is discussion about two

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:01.400
being the number on boards.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.100
Another way of
looking at it, we can

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:07.040
say most boards have around
20 something, only two women

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.780
are on them.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.310
Low number.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.050
Negative story.

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:14.070
Or I should say
negative narrative.

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:18.150
Equally positive narrative,
equally accurate, more positive

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:22.894
narrative, excuse me, is to
identify that most companies,

00:21:22.894 --> 00:21:24.560
depending on what
country you're looking

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:29.270
and 70% of countries,
80% of countries

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:32.720
have women on their boards.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.780
The actors who are behaving
in ways that we do not

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:39.360
find desirable need
to be presented

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.675
as the outlier whenever
it is accurate.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:48.010
So part of it is how do we tell
people what they should think.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:50.880
People want to be in
the regular group.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.660
We all like to think that we
want to be really special.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.990
Our behavior does
not demonstrate that.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:22:00.070
Our behavior demonstrates we
want to be like everybody else.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:04.050
Now how do we get to
the good outcomes.

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:05.790
Old board room.

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.970
Wonderful study by one of our
former researchers at the women

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:12.130
and public policy
program, Aaron Dhir.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:15.490
And what Aaron focused on
was where in the organization

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:19.100
do you want to put your
gender interventions.

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.730
And he looked at
how you may have

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:22.450
noticed on the back
of your perspectives,

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:24.590
or buried towards
the end, there'll

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:27.050
be a disclosure
about the diversity

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:29.550
policy for the
organization, but you

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:33.120
are being asked to
identify and vote

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.960
for who they put on the board.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:41.220
As soon as an intervention
is about compliance,

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:47.630
not main mission, compliance,
no action follows from it.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:50.510
What his study showed wasn't
that you had low effect,

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:53.140
you have zero
effect consistently.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.250
Once something lands in
the OGC's office, and this

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:58.420
is something we have
to do, and it's not

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.820
about what we have to
provide to our stakeholders,

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:03.094
no change takes place.

00:23:03.094 --> 00:23:04.510
And you can end
up with rooms that

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:08.610
look like that or your rooms
remain looking like that.

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:13.640
Now how is it that we
get to a very vastly

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.257
different situation.

00:23:16.257 --> 00:23:18.590
Somebody earlier had talked
about what it's really about

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:20.260
is talent management.

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.490
And when our wonderful Dean
Cohen from the Radcliffe

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:24.410
Institute opened her remarks.

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:28.250
She talked about how the
education gap has reversed.

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:30.140
In the United
States and in Europe

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.720
and over the next several
years in South America,

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:36.520
the majority of those to
get high school, associates,

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.205
college, and postgraduate
degrees are all-female.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.650
So what that means is the
talent force is female.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:47.870
The larger the company and
the larger the government,

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:49.869
the more they're aware of this.

00:23:49.869 --> 00:23:51.410
The larger the
government, the larger

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:53.743
the company, the more likely
they are to reach out to me

00:23:53.743 --> 00:23:56.630
or one of my colleagues
to try to understand

00:23:56.630 --> 00:24:02.090
how did they do it right in both
access talent pools in hire,

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:05.040
retain, and promote.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:09.132
Recall and remember, women,
we are not an interest group.

00:24:09.132 --> 00:24:10.590
When you look at
the talent market,

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:14.280
we are literally
the whole ball game.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.970
So, what we see here
is an orchestra.

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:20.830
There's wonderful work done by
Claudia Goldin examining what

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:28.110
took place when all of a
sudden orchestral auditions

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:29.760
took place behind a screen.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.650
I will summarize.

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:38.670
The number of women who are
selected in final rounds

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:41.910
went up to 30%.

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:46.130
And this is for a task
which everybody understands

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:50.410
all you want is to hear
the music, an incredibly

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:54.780
disassociated task in terms
of whether men or women could

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:55.560
do it better.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:59.130
All you have to do is hear it.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:03.970
Now we can't replicate
having a screen in every hire

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:05.630
that we do.

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:10.580
But several things take
place, one, hiring in bundles.

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.880
Those of us who are
here from industry

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.250
understand that initial classes
which come into organizations

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:18.330
tend to be more diverse.

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:21.930
But that diversity doesn't carry
forward as we move people up

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:23.100
in organizations.

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.600
Why?

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.630
If I ask you today
and I want each of you

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:31.030
to think you could have anything
you want for dessert at dinner.

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:32.397
Can you each think of it?

00:25:32.397 --> 00:25:33.730
Janet, I'm going to pick on you.

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:36.370
What would you like for dessert?

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:37.590
Pecan pie.

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:41.450
If I ask you to fill out
a calendar for every lunch

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:44.300
and every dinner for
the next 12 months,

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.840
will you only choose pecan pie?

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.020
Of course not.

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.574
When people are
hiring in bundles

00:25:49.574 --> 00:25:50.990
they understand
and have awareness

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:53.080
that they will want diversity.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.240
But when people are
hiring for one offs,

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.510
they tend to want what
their favorite is.

00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:59.770
Favorite is a
substitute word for what

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:02.110
Allison talked
about as well, which

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:06.300
is people want to hire for
what they view is male tasks.

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:10.050
What tasks are male and
female are defined by culture?

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:13.660
There is nothing
innate about them.

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:17.470
And we know this, because they
vary by culture, by region,

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:21.650
by time period, but we don't
like breaking that gender

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:22.870
stereotype.

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:26.240
So what we know-- moving
on to a terrific paper

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:30.460
by WaPPPs director, Iris
Bohnet and her colleagues,

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.960
Max Bazerman and
Alexander van Geen,

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:38.320
is that when we look at one off
hires and one off promotions,

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:42.530
the nontraditional
candidate does very poorly.

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:46.230
One offs are never measured
against another live person.

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:50.230
They're measured against
a fictitious norm.

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:55.860
It is really hard to
be the fictitious norm.

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.690
Really hard.

00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:01.000
So what happens is when you
compare more than one candidate

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.730
and you can easily
build processes

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:06.260
within companies where you
look at multiple people

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:09.360
at a stage or time period.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.360
And I say time period
because you can't always

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:15.150
make that higher promotion in
multiple departments at once,

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:17.840
but you can look back
over time to compare

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.640
against other former candidates.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.380
And once you're looking at
real data, the effect of bias

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.370
goes away.

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:31.880
Then we begin to compare
Janet's performance

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.550
with Rebecca's performance, or
Janet's performance with John's

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:38.710
performance, and
women do very well

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:42.510
with no bias effect, which
by the way is a huge finding.

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:47.455
We would expect at most it would
be mitigated but not go away.

00:27:47.455 --> 00:27:49.580
And I have lots of other
things I could go through,

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:51.330
but we're going to
skip all that and we're

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:54.490
going to jump to policy
making for a moment.

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:59.160
Big solutions require
systems design.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.610
And I gave you a
couple examples of ways

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:06.560
you can redesign systems to
help people get over their bias.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:12.150
Let me also note this is
not a guy-girl problem.

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:16.660
This is not something
that bad men do to women.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:20.900
This is a problem that each of
us is pickled in the culture

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.260
that we live in.

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:26.700
It is very easy to put the
cucumber into the brine.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:31.700
It is nearly impossible to get
the brine out of the pickle.

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:35.090
Men and women hiring
officers underpay women

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:37.990
at the same rate.

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:41.620
Female CEOs provide really
significant role modeling

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.410
effects.

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:46.950
Role modeling
effects dramatically

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:51.150
change the fictional
norm in one's mind.

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:53.250
It gets recreated.

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:56.260
And it gets recreated in
really spectacular ways,

00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:00.300
which is why there's incredible
tools that can be used.

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.700
And you can find--

00:29:04.105 --> 00:29:05.480
Oh, this is a
really great thing.

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.938
I'm out of time, but I'm going
to share it with you anyway.

00:29:07.938 --> 00:29:11.000
As we talk about recreating
what things look like.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.590
Now here's an ad.

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:16.270
I don't know if anyone actually
saw this ad in your journals,

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:18.500
but this is a woman
who's an engineer.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:22.190
She was in this ad and got
really awful feedback--

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:24.210
Facebook, and
Twitter, and so forth.

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:30.490
And she started a hashtag
of I look like an engineer.

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:40.820
And all of these different women
have joined in and re-created

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:44.250
what it looks like.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:47.660
And each of us keeps culture.

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.890
In each of us sits
in a position,

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:52.350
where we have the ability
to begin to change

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:54.390
organizational design.

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:57.550
There are some of us
who sit uniquely placed.

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:59.670
And I just want to share
as my final comment

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:02.280
with the audience, it
isn't enough to think

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:06.110
about what are the opportunities
for the change I can make,

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:08.030
it's about what are
the responsibilities

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:11.170
for the change I must make.

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:13.840
And identifying where you have
the power, and the impact,

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.789
and the ability, and then
who do you reach out to,

00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:18.580
and how do you ensure
that you consistently

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:21.110
have the tools that you need.

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:23.890
Everything I've
talked about today

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:25.890
are the types of things
that I and my colleagues

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:29.610
go and talk to leaders about.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:33.410
And we thought how do
we bring this to scale.

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:35.300
How do we turn this
from my conversation

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:39.600
that I'm having with Valerie
Jarrett and her key advisers,

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.386
or with the governor,
or my colleague

00:30:41.386 --> 00:30:43.760
Iris Bohnet is having with
the [INAUDIBLE] administration

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.610
to something that anyone
can have access to

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:49.950
and any person in any
organization can do.

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:52.680
And we created what's called
the gender action portal.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.030
All the research I
mentioned today and hundreds

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:58.500
of other studies, which are
all experimentally based,

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:02.490
they are not best practice,
they are not views,

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:05.480
they are experimentally
tested information--

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.390
are on the gender action portal.

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:11.020
Every paper is summarized
in lay person's terms

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:16.240
all the way down to one
sentence and then to one screen.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.250
And you can link and see
where the study took place.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:21.260
You can link to the--
for my colleagues

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:23.640
who'll want to read the
entire studies, soup to nuts

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.420
and understand all
the methodology.

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:28.290
There is a methodology
summary, but there is also--

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:29.860
you can go to the full paper.

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:32.260
But it provides tools
that you can use

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.750
and its all searchable
by general public topic

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:37.350
conversation topics.

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:39.180
Thank you very much
and I look forward

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:41.450
to hearing from the
rest of my co panelists

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:43.010
and from hearing
from your questions.

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:48.280
-Thank you, Victoria.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:53.560
And I would like to invite
you to make your comments.

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.400
-Thanks.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.590
It's an honor and
pleasure to be here today.

00:31:56.590 --> 00:32:00.820
I've just been super excited
about the presentations

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:02.880
and the discussion
that we've had so far.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:07.250
So I'm excited to
contribute my thoughts.

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:11.210
So to kick off I
thought I'd address

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:14.540
why developing the
strategies and solutions

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:19.160
is important in economic
terms from my perspective.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.170
So as you may know
we're currently

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:25.580
living in the longest
open IPO biotech window.

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:28.270
I would have made the
same statement in February

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:30.820
and we are six months later.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:36.420
The past three years have been
the biggest most lavish party.

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:44.280
The NASDAQ biotech index went
up 54% in 2013, 34% last year,

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:47.940
and hit 34% earlier this year.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:53.760
In 2014 74 biopharmas
entered the public market

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:57.470
raising $5.6 billion.

00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:03.440
As a level set, if we added up
all the IPOs from 2008 to 2011

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:07.600
for those four years, only
42 stocks of companies

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:12.880
went to the public market
raising only $3.6 billion.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:16.500
For the first half
of 2015, we've

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:20.710
already had over 40 biopharmas
into the public market.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:23.990
And they've raised $3.8 billion.

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:27.280
As a result of the
strong IPO market,

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.800
the venture capital firms who
invested in these companies

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.490
started making distributions
to their limited partners

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:36.710
and to themselves.

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:41.690
The reported gross IRR for
the biopharma venture industry

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:45.580
from 2011 to the first
quarter of this year

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:52.330
is 70% with realized
gross IRRs over 100%.

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:59.480
This in turn provided
venture investors

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:02.340
the ability to raise new funds.

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:05.200
And raise new funds that have.

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.570
In 2014 the biotech
venture community

00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:10.050
raised over $9 billion.

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:16.480
As a level set, if you simply
look at 2013, the far more

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.810
usual $4 billion.

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:23.900
At the end of Q2 2015,
the venture community

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:28.040
had already raised almost
another $9 billion halfway

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.447
through the year.

00:34:29.447 --> 00:34:31.030
And you might have
noticed [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:33.120
news yesterday announcing
a new $1 billion

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:37.139
fund in their SEC filing.

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:38.960
Furthermore, the
venture community

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.270
is deploying these funds.

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:45.310
2014 companies raised
$6 billion for venture.

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:48.380
The industry norm is usually
somewhere between $4 and $5

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:51.159
billion a year.

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:55.679
And as anticipated 2015 is
tracking to outpace 2014.

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:58.630
And in the first
half of 2014, company

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:03.920
has raised already $4
billion in venture.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:08.930
Interestingly, the number of
new deals is holding steady.

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:12.020
So the size of the
deals are increasing.

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:15.740
So the wealth creation
and real distribution

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:20.100
over the past three years
has been tremendous.

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.960
So who is capturing the wealth?

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.920
Let's start with
the management team.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.230
We've talked about this today.

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:32.050
So I'll just add my two cents.

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:35.100
If you look at the 30
biopharmas that entered the US

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:40.260
public markets in 2015 of the
set I looked at the other day,

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:43.620
one of the 30 had
a woman as the CEO.

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:47.460
Thinks to Jill
over at Catabasis.

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.560
If you look at the
CEOs of the 91 biotechs

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:56.920
who had venture financings
in 2015 so far, 11 of the 91

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.160
have women CEOs.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.570
That's 12%.

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:02.760
And looking at the
boards-- here I

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:06.780
just looked at the private
companies in our portfolio.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.290
And I was encouraged.

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:12.420
40% of the companies had
a woman on the board.

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:13.780
That's the marketing message.

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.130
-It's nicely stated.

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:18.210
-However, if I looked
at the number of women

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:23.180
board members relative to the
total number of board members,

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:23.680
6%.

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:29.180
So let's look at the investors.

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:33.290
And looking at the 40 firms that
raise new funds in 2014, 2015

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:36.620
located here in the US,
roughly a quarter of the funds

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:38.850
had women partners.

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:40.690
And looking deeper
at the early stage

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:43.790
active institutional
funds that I work with,

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:47.850
these 18 firms had 120
managing or general partners,

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:49.120
and 11 of them were women.

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.240
That's 9%.

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.830
So the wealth creation
story I've described

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:58.330
has been developing and
playing out over years.

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:01.980
It's real and material
the past three years.

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:05.790
And there are scarce
few women in this story,

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:10.040
but people are making money.

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:13.360
So let's move on to thinking
about creating strategy

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:16.100
and solutions for
increasing access

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:19.400
and likelihood of success.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.370
So as we know Boston is the
dominant biotech cluster

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:23.790
in the world.

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:27.670
In large part because
of the meticulous,

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:31.870
well oiled innovation
system that we have.

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:35.160
The parts include entrepreneurs,
management teams, investors,

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:38.210
academicians, and others.

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:40.220
In increasing the
achievement of women in all

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:45.910
parts of this ecosystem is
critical to a robust net gain.

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:51.910
So I'll offer four areas to
consider for enacting change.

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:58.050
Where it all begins, recruiting,
marketing, and investing.

00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:02.610
So area one, addressing where
it all begins, and here I

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:06.290
reference the work of
Nancy at MIT and others.

00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:09.200
Nancy found that women faculty
participation and company

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:15.240
founding was about 5% relative
to their male colleagues.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.250
From experience I
deeply know that

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:19.820
whoever the founding
academics are

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:24.090
deeply shapes what that company
will look like for its life.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.860
The academic founders are
the number one employee

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:32.410
in the early stage biotech.

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:35.520
Their interests, their
vision their personality

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.980
and who they call--
the investors

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:41.365
the entrepreneurs-- is critical
to how the opportunity evolves.

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:48.300
So I would encourage the
continued work in that area.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:54.370
Area two, recruiting, building
leadership and management teams

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:57.470
a pipeline for
success in biotech.

00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:59.990
So here we've already
heard some thoughts

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:02.990
I think experience
credibility and network can

00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:07.190
be built very effectively.

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:09.170
And some of the
larger organizations,

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:13.080
they may provide the
development opportunities

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.840
the experience set
importantly a place

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.930
where you can build your
network before moving

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:22.020
into what I'll call less
normalized environments

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.890
of early stage biotech.

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:27.360
I acknowledge the points on
the network versus hierarchy,

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.110
but I do think there
are a lot of benefits

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:32.620
to being in a large organization
with resources you can readily

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:34.210
harness.

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:39.970
Successfully transitioning
women from these institutions

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:43.570
into the early stage
innovation biotech ecosystem

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:45.590
as senior executives,
I think, is

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:47.590
something we need to work on.

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:49.900
Here I'll highlight
a group that I've

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:52.860
been involved with for many
years called, Springboard

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.520
Enterprises.

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.440
It's a nonprofit
organization that's

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.360
dedicated to supporting women
entrepreneurs in startup

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.425
executives.

00:40:00.425 --> 00:40:02.690
They have excellent
mentorship, access

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:04.940
to an incredible network
of alumni and partners

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:05.680
and investors.

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.810
They built up almost
in two decades.

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:12.710
The level of experience
doesn't matter at Springboard.

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:16.420
The platform is open whether a
woman is on her third start up

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:17.670
or her first.

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:19.650
She has no years of
experience or she

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:21.170
has decades of experience.

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:24.470
The platform is
there to be used.

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:29.110
The third area that I offer
for enacting change-- marketing

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:31.250
successes and creating
new frameworks.

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:34.320
So I hope this is all very
much along the lines is

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.790
what's been discussed already.

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:41.520
The community needs to
market success stories

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:44.730
to expand the phenotypes
that fit success

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:48.450
in the minds of the investors
and of senior executives.

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:52.410
So the New England Venture
Capital Association, the NEVCA,

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:54.250
the regional venture
capital group.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:58.700
The director, who just
recently left, CA Webb,

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:01.140
I thought made excellent
strides in the last five years

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:04.020
to help the New England
venture community market

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:05.520
its own successes.

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:07.180
And she paid
particular attention

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:08.940
to the success of women.

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.420
I'm very interested
in who's going

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:15.020
to be the new director of NEVCA,
because the success that I feel

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:17.940
CA has put in that organization
over the past five years

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:20.180
has been tremendous.

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:23.280
Area four is the
investing community.

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:25.500
Here I think we can take
advantage and continue

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:29.860
to foster the changing landscape
in the investment community.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:32.480
So just a couple words on
the traditional institutional

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.710
venture capital community.

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:39.270
The industry knows
it has a problem.

00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:43.390
And it's trying to take
some steps to address this.

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:44.990
But you can imagine
it's pretty hard

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:49.470
when you've been raking in
cash for the past three years.

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:56.260
So in 2011, back pre-boom,
the National Venture Capital

00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:58.890
Association, the singular
venture capital industry

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:03.940
association of the US,
surveyed investors in the US.

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:07.570
And 89% of the investors
were male and 11% female,

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:09.850
as I think has been noted.

00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:12.750
In 2014, the NVCA
took its first steps

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:14.660
and form the
diversity task force

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:17.880
on the lawn of the White House
and committed to developing

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:22.650
meaningful solutions to support
diversity in venture firms.

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:23.280
We'll see.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:27.670
The first report this slated
for the annual meeting in 2016.

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:29.620
I think they have a
nice group of people

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:34.090
who are on that task force,
a combination of people

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:37.120
I think who can put forth some
really compelling suggestions

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.840
that I hope at least a
large chunk of venture firms

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:43.550
will be able to adopt and will
speak to their interests, which

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:46.870
let's be clear institutional
venture capital,

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:48.240
your job is to make money.

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:55.680
In the meantime, with
the boom that's happened

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.970
there has been a tremendous
growth in alternative financing

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:02.450
sources relative to the
traditional institutional

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:04.020
venture capital.

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:07.140
And I think you can
start to see this

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:12.990
as you see the migration of
the institutional venture firms

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:16.950
into pockets, where they used
to sort of loan everything that

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:18.250
came out of the universities.

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:20.100
It's a very
interesting migration

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:22.570
that's been happening
over the past three years.

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:26.260
Family offices, angel
investors, an angel groups

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:29.880
we're often the sort of the step
children of the industry back

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:30.830
in the day.

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:33.880
They're often retail
moguls, media moguls,

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:37.440
that's who sort of belonged,
because that's who had money.

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.710
With the boom, successful
biotech executives

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:42.660
are now part of those networks.

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:44.710
They do financings
for companies.

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:48.480
I think many people know that
some of the genzyme executives

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.600
are now the angel
funders of many biotechs

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.709
that have started in Boston.

00:43:53.709 --> 00:43:55.250
So what's been
offered by the venture

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:58.550
firms is now resident in some
of these alternative financing

00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:02.160
sources that is highly
sophisticated investors that

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.780
know the business,
have the networks,

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:07.860
and have capital that
make them successful.

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:09.450
Another source of
capital that used

00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:12.550
to be the odd man out
in traditional venture

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:15.344
is the corporate
venture capital group.

00:44:15.344 --> 00:44:20.060
Today nearly every major pharma
has a corporate venture team

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:23.090
doing direct investments
in companies.

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:26.330
Many of these teams know
and live the business,

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:27.840
because that's what they live.

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:31.270
They have the relevant networks
and they have the capital.

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:34.400
So just as a level
set, the R&amp;D budget

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:38.046
of Sanofi on an annual
basis is $5 billion.

00:44:38.046 --> 00:44:39.820
On a usual year
that's the amount

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:42.700
that's deployed into the
entirety of the biotech venture

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.670
capital industry.

00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:48.640
So small changes in
pharma R&amp;D allocations

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:53.070
can have major impact on
early stage biotech investing.

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:56.340
And as some of you may know the
intense hunger of the pharmas

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:58.680
for innovation,
and the recognition

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:02.170
that much more innovation
happens outside of your walls

00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:04.170
than inside of your
company's walls

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:07.450
has already begun
to drive change.

00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:10.940
So there are many other
new sources of capital

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:12.780
that are having major impact.

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:16.110
Some of you may have been
following the amazing work

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:20.190
of the Cystic Fibrosis
Foundation, MMRF, Michael J.

00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:23.760
Fox Foundation, and
JDRF in contributing

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.950
these different
sources of capital

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:27.145
into early stage biotech.

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:34.440
So in closing, the
new world that's

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.900
been created during this
heyday of biotech, I think,

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:41.630
presents challenges as well
as incredible opportunity.

00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:44.620
It's important to understand
the magnitude of how women have

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:47.750
participated so far in this
process of wealth creation

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:49.830
and distribution.

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:54.610
And the examples that I've
given of groups, associations,

00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:58.030
springboard, the
NEVCA, all these groups

00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:00.300
are working very hard
on the four dimensions

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:01.770
that I've outlined.

00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:05.730
So what's left to
be done other than

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:10.250
these individual dimensions need
to continue to push forward.

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:12.390
I think similar to
what others have said,

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:15.130
it's the orchestration
of the ecosystem

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:17.600
to lead to a successful
business outcome

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.730
that we're still missing.

00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:25.800
So to be clear, venture
capital is a club.

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:32.690
The founders, the investors,
the board, the CEOs,

00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:35.160
they're very pre-set and
have longstanding decades

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:37.280
of history, because
you trust each other

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:40.900
that you're going to make
money at the end of the day.

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:45.450
So how can we create a new way
to orchestrate the ecosystem

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:48.190
to achieve a successful
business outcome

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:51.780
and support the value
proposition of why

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:55.320
these companies, these investor
groups need to look different.

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.210
I think we can do this
in two different ways.

00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:59.420
How do we orchestrate--
as has been suggested

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:01.860
that the system level,
more the structural level--

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:04.000
in coordinating
changes and sharing

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.070
across these different
groups-- what's happening,

00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:08.710
so that we can have
the impact together.

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:10.730
And then the other
level at which

00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:14.490
we can orchestrate the
ecosystem is at the-- I

00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:17.270
call it as we were
talking earlier, Deborah--

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:19.210
sort of the get it done level.

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:21.900
So the entrepreneurs,
the investors,

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:25.919
the founders, the academicians,
and the executives--

00:47:25.919 --> 00:47:28.210
the guys get together and
talk about what it is they're

00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:29.622
going to do.

00:47:29.622 --> 00:47:31.330
Why don't the girls
get together and talk

00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:33.538
about what they're going to
do for their new company.

00:47:33.538 --> 00:47:36.380
And I say that in a sense of
not to the exclusion of any one

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:39.500
party, but this
is how it happens.

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:41.980
So I think we need
to recognize that.

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:44.610
It's been a successful
model and let's maybe

00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:47.390
try to replicate that with a
slightly different combination

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:49.410
of people at the table.

00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:55.110
So I hope this has given some
ideas of the value proposition

00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:56.680
or the business outcome.

00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:00.030
And I hope that we can
see some real change.

00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:03.140
And maybe there's an
opportunity from this forum

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:05.760
to come together to push
forward on some of these ideas

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:08.940
for better orchestrating
our own ecosystem, which

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:11.185
in Boston if we make a
change the rest of the world

00:48:11.185 --> 00:48:11.685
will notice.

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:21.210
-Thank you, Ann.

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:23.930
And I'm glad that
you're so upbeat.

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:26.290
And Robin, please.

00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:26.790
-Sure.

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:27.290
Thank you.

00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:30.050
Well, it's really a
pleasure to be here.

00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:32.950
Thank you for
inviting me and it's

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:37.730
been really interesting to
hear all of the other speakers.

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:40.270
And I go to a lot
of these conferences

00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:43.660
and I don't say
that at all of them.

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:46.400
So what I'd like
to talk about today

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:50.040
is just to give you a
little bit of background

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:55.550
on how I see the problems
with women's advancement.

00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:56.630
Where are the barriers?

00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:59.046
I'm going to talk a little bit
about the cultural context,

00:48:59.046 --> 00:49:01.720
that is outside of the
organization, the culture

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:04.210
within which the
organization is situated.

00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:06.610
And I'm going to talk about
how that culture seeps

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:10.780
into the organization
to create a context that

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:12.180
creates barriers for women.

00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:15.640
And then I'm going to
talk about a case example.

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:19.166
So this is Harvard Business
School culture and community

00:49:19.166 --> 00:49:19.665
initiative.

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:25.900
So we've been over this
ground a little bit,

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:27.910
but I thought I would
just summarize it.

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:30.394
I think it speaks to
some of the findings

00:49:30.394 --> 00:49:31.560
that we heard about earlier.

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:35.020
So these are the kinds
of messages that we get,

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:36.400
men and women.

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.710
We associate leaders
with these kinds

00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:42.030
of traits-- competitive,
assertive, decisive.

00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:44.570
And we associate women
with a different set

00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:47.930
of traits like warm,
nurturing, and communal.

00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:51.350
And the clear problem
here is that there's

00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:55.840
a disconnect for women and
leaders, but not so for men.

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:58.530
So you can just kind of
replace man and leader

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:00.320
and get pretty much
the same thing.

00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:04.746
This is, I think, the
message in a nut shell.

00:50:04.746 --> 00:50:06.078
I don't know if you can read it.

00:50:06.078 --> 00:50:08.370
It says, but when a woman
has someone's head cut off

00:50:08.370 --> 00:50:09.740
she's a bitch.

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:13.440
So I actually think that this
might be the bad ass woman

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:15.640
that we talked about earlier.

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:19.350
And I do think that in
reference to some of the things

00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:24.220
that Allison reported that these
are the messages that women

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:25.180
are getting.

00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:27.212
That if you take a
position of power

00:50:27.212 --> 00:50:28.920
there will be some
negative consequences.

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:31.930
So it's not surprising
to me that she

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:34.360
would find what she finds.

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:37.790
And I would attribute it
to this cultural context.

00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:39.260
Here's another
message that we get.

00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:43.070
So the cultural ideal, if it's
not to be a woman in power,

00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:46.230
it is a mother,
who quits her job.

00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:51.310
I take this from the cover story
in 2003 of the New York Times.

00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:55.050
Lisa Belkin wrote an article,
which put basically opting out

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:57.100
into our lexicon.

00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:59.000
It really has caught on.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.770
We did a survey of
Harvard Business School

00:51:02.770 --> 00:51:06.310
alumni, a sample of
over 5,000 of them,

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:09.940
and gave them a bunch of
different possible reasons

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:12.420
for women's stalled advancement.

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:16.960
And this was the one that most
people agreed with, that women

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:18.510
prioritize family over work.

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:23.460
So 75% of our alumni believe
this, and 82% of women.

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:26.090
So women were actually
more likely to endorse this

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:30.690
as a barrier, a reason that
women are not making it.

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:32.200
And I always like
to point out when

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:36.300
I present this slide that
I really think everybody

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:38.350
prioritizes family over work.

00:51:38.350 --> 00:51:41.660
I don't think this
is a women thing.

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:44.550
It's what does that
actually mean to people.

00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:47.630
And to men, it very often
means being a breadwinner.

00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:49.290
So he's going to
ratchet up at work.

00:51:49.290 --> 00:51:51.170
And for a woman, it
means to be a caretaker.

00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:52.810
So she's going to ratchet back.

00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:55.270
So it's not about
prioritizing family over work.

00:51:55.270 --> 00:52:00.560
It's about how the
culture describes

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:04.280
what that sort of tells us
what that actually means.

00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:05.400
And it's very gendered.

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:07.810
OK, so that's the
larger cultural context.

00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:10.530
Now I want to talk about
the organizational context.

00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:13.410
We talk about gender
norms and practices.

00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:18.450
So for many years we had just
basic good old fashioned sex

00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:19.680
discrimination.

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:21.180
We still have some.

00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:23.730
But we call that now first
generation gender bias.

00:52:23.730 --> 00:52:25.720
Those are explicit
intentional forms

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:27.990
of discrimination and bias.

00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:30.550
They're against the law,
and we don't see them

00:52:30.550 --> 00:52:31.967
as often as we used to.

00:52:31.967 --> 00:52:33.550
What we're really
seeing much more now

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:35.690
is what we call second
generation gender bias.

00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:38.510
This is implicit bias,
it's unintentional.

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:41.720
And it basically
comes in from the fact

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:43.690
that most workplaces
were designed

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:46.605
to fit men's styles
and life situations.

00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:56.520
The organizations are filled
with practices and policies

00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:59.240
and norms that appear
gender neutral,

00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:01.480
but that when they're
enacted actually

00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:04.290
create different patterns of
experience for men and women.

00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:07.100
And they add up these
sort of micro practices

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.240
and interactions.

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:11.940
And Laurel talked about the
interaction or situations

00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:14.790
that women and men find
themselves in organizations

00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:15.680
are quite different.

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:17.304
And that's what I'm
talking about here.

00:53:17.304 --> 00:53:20.210
And those are the things that
impede women's advancement

00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:22.989
or push them out altogether.

00:53:22.989 --> 00:53:24.530
I should say I don't
have time, but I

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:27.380
have a lot of data
also to suggest just

00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:29.440
on that point of
pushing women out.

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:34.730
Yes, women are pushed out
more likely than they opt out.

00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:37.280
But they're actually not
opting out at the rate

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.290
that we might think they are.

00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:40.820
So I can speak to
that later, but I

00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:42.140
didn't have time to go into it.

00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:44.780
So a little bit more about
organizational context

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:47.250
before I get into the
case just to give you

00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:48.939
a sense of what I mean.

00:53:48.939 --> 00:53:50.480
So I'm going to give
you some quotes.

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:53.810
These are things that I have
heard in the course of my work

00:53:53.810 --> 00:53:56.300
or my colleagues have heard
in the course of their work

00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:57.910
on gender issues with companies.

00:53:57.910 --> 00:54:01.420
So here's a health care
company, and a woman says,

00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:03.290
I sat in a performance
review and actually

00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:06.700
counted the number of times
women were described as nice.

00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:08.710
That was never a
point of discussion

00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:10.380
about the men being reviewed.

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.070
OK, so this is the
manifestation of what

00:54:12.070 --> 00:54:13.630
I was talking about earlier.

00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:17.730
That the fact that woman
doesn't equal leader.

00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:20.059
In a financial
management firm, as soon

00:54:20.059 --> 00:54:21.850
as I started working
at home one day a week

00:54:21.850 --> 00:54:24.160
my performance reviews
went down despite the fact

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.790
that my clients were happier
and I got more work done.

00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:30.770
This is irrational, but
we see this kind of thing

00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:32.210
happening all the time.

00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:35.900
And it's a result of that other
piece about the cultural ideal

00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:37.110
of who women are.

00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:39.410
And once they go home,
once they have children,

00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:42.880
they're seen as less
committed workers.

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:44.630
So there's research
on that as well.

00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:48.440
Here's an accounting firm, in
year end evaluation sessions

00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:50.070
a woman was found
a little bit short

00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:52.400
and we can see how she
was going to get there.

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:54.830
A man was found a little
short, but we could figure out

00:54:54.830 --> 00:54:57.430
how he was going to get there,
because he looks like me.

00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:58.770
This is a man speaking.

00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:00.970
And I knew what I look
like five years ago

00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:02.641
and what I needed
to grow into this.

00:55:02.641 --> 00:55:04.390
So this is the kind
of thing that happens,

00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:06.960
because of the demographics
of organizations.

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:09.720
And another one from a
consulting firm, our job

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:11.590
posting seek for perfection.

00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:15.370
Men who don't meet all the
qualifications apply anyway;

00:55:15.370 --> 00:55:16.580
women hold back.

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:19.590
So this is an interesting
one, because in this company

00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:21.110
we were talking
to them about how

00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:24.611
this was a gendered
practice and problematic.

00:55:24.611 --> 00:55:26.110
And they said, oh
gosh you're right,

00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:26.900
you know what we should do?

00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:28.520
We should tell the women
they should apply anyway.

00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:30.561
You know they should just
inflate what they-- you

00:55:30.561 --> 00:55:31.970
know like what the men do.

00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:34.020
We were like, well you
know you could do that.

00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:36.186
You can change the women,
like that's what we always

00:55:36.186 --> 00:55:37.660
want to do is fix the women.

00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:43.380
Or you could actually post a
job posting that was realistic.

00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:45.040
Imagine that.

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:49.420
That's what I'm talking about
when I say that organizations

00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:53.620
are gendered and in my emphasis
and that of my colleagues

00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:55.810
is to actually change
those practices.

00:55:55.810 --> 00:55:58.860
To just to kind of
highlight a few things here,

00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:02.060
these are practices,
performance, reviews, year end

00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:04.940
evaluation sessions,
job postings, and then

00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:09.000
we see that there is a
disproportionately negative

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.590
effect that those
practices, which

00:56:11.590 --> 00:56:16.330
would appear gender neutral
on their face, have on women.

00:56:16.330 --> 00:56:18.190
OK, so remedies.

00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:21.970
So we hear a lot about
unconscious bias training.

00:56:21.970 --> 00:56:24.040
This is sort of the
darling right now.

00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.200
I think in particular
in high tech.

00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:28.860
Google's doing this, so
everybody else is doing it.

00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:31.180
So increasing awareness of bias.

00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:32.260
Reducing discrimination.

00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:34.620
Of course instituting work
family accommodations.

00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:36.120
We know that's a
double edged sword,

00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:38.610
well mostly it's negative,
because it produces

00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:40.520
a kind of flexibility stigma.

00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:42.710
People who take them--
and it is mostly women--

00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:46.350
end up being stigmatized, and
their careers are derailed

00:56:46.350 --> 00:56:48.090
And then this is
an interesting one.

00:56:48.090 --> 00:56:50.190
So somebody who
was at [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:52.780
was telling me about a
dinner that he went to.

00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:55.240
Actually it was a dinner
that Sheryl Sandberg had.

00:56:55.240 --> 00:57:00.480
And apparently it's quite
a competitive thing like,

00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:02.290
who goes to whose
dinners and there's

00:57:02.290 --> 00:57:05.650
only two or three and who shows
up at yours and blah blah blah.

00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:08.180
So this person was saying, he
had gone to Sheryl Sandberg's

00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:10.388
and was very pleased to see
there were all these CEOs

00:57:10.388 --> 00:57:12.120
and it was attracting
a lot of attention.

00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:15.060
That's great news, but the
thing that was problematic,

00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:17.110
which he noticed was
that they were all

00:57:17.110 --> 00:57:19.660
talking about this--
oh well, we know

00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:22.160
how to solve this problem
now that we see it.

00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:25.126
Of course we'll just address it,
so we'll set some benchmarks,

00:57:25.126 --> 00:57:27.500
we'll set some metrics and
we'll hold people accountable,

00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:29.630
and the problem's
going to go away.

00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:33.025
So unfortunately, that's
not going to happen.

00:57:33.025 --> 00:57:34.650
What worries me a
little bit, because I

00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:36.233
don't know where
their energy is going

00:57:36.233 --> 00:57:38.860
to go when they find out that
actually it's not that easy.

00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:40.390
So the perspective
that we take is

00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:43.220
that accelerating women's
advancement is deep

00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:45.010
ongoing transformational work.

00:57:45.010 --> 00:57:49.040
This is culture change
work and it's very hard.

00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:52.160
So I'm going to
give you an example.

00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:54.640
We're like about four
years in and I would say

00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:58.820
we made a tiny bit of progress.

00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:00.070
So I just want to start there.

00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:01.800
This is not like a
huge success story.

00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:04.965
I'm not going to claim
a lot of progress here,

00:58:04.965 --> 00:58:06.840
but I do think that
we're on the right track.

00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:08.870
And I think there's
something to learn from it.

00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:11.580
So we call it the culture
and community initiative.

00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:16.500
It really was generated
from faculty recognition

00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:19.281
of this historical
gender grade gap.

00:58:19.281 --> 00:58:20.780
Some of you may
have read about some

00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:22.040
of this in The New York Times.

00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:23.580
I'm going to try and
set the record straight,

00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:24.996
because actually
what was reported

00:58:24.996 --> 00:58:26.650
was not really accurate.

00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:30.090
But at any rate, so there
was this gender grade gap.

00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:31.490
We had it for years.

00:58:31.490 --> 00:58:35.360
It was something that was
publicly doned, because we list

00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:38.970
the students who receive the
Baker scholar award, which

00:58:38.970 --> 00:58:40.019
is based on grades.

00:58:40.019 --> 00:58:42.560
And you can always just count
the number of women in the list

00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:44.851
and compare it to the proportion
of women in the class.

00:58:44.851 --> 00:58:48.160
And what you'd find is that
women were underrepresented.

00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:50.650
They were about half.

00:58:50.650 --> 00:58:54.240
So the thing is it was
never publicly acknowledged.

00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:59.050
And then there was a faculty
meeting a number of years

00:58:59.050 --> 00:59:01.140
ago now, where one of
my women colleagues

00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:02.470
stood up and pointed this out.

00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:04.470
Of course we would always
be whispering about it

00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:07.850
next to each other and talking
about it behind closed doors,

00:59:07.850 --> 00:59:08.915
but it wasn't public.

00:59:08.915 --> 00:59:11.040
I think it was very important
that she raised this,

00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:13.110
she asked the question,
she put it on the agenda,

00:59:13.110 --> 00:59:15.560
people got very
uncomfortable, nobody really

00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:17.490
wanted to sort of
think about why

00:59:17.490 --> 00:59:20.150
it might be that women
were getting lower grades,

00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:22.810
because of course the
underlying belief from many,

00:59:22.810 --> 00:59:25.680
many of my colleagues was that
they just weren't that good.

00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:26.461
You know.

00:59:26.461 --> 00:59:27.960
Well, diversity is
really important,

00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:31.170
but you have to lower
standards to get women in here.

00:59:31.170 --> 00:59:32.870
We have a forced
grade distribution

00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:35.120
and somebody's got to be at
the bottom in every class.

00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:37.126
And it's going to be the
ones who are less good;

00:59:37.126 --> 00:59:38.250
it's going to be the women.

00:59:38.250 --> 00:59:40.280
OK, so that was I
think the story out

00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:44.590
there that was not
voiced so publicly.

00:59:44.590 --> 00:59:46.550
But we also had a
disproportionate turnover

00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:47.570
among women faculty.

00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:48.986
There were a couple
of years where

00:59:48.986 --> 00:59:50.250
we lost a lot of junior women.

00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:56.170
And that was quite noticeable
and quite disturbing.

00:59:56.170 --> 01:00:00.050
So in 2010, Dean Nitin
Nohria was appointed,

01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:03.480
and when he was putting
his priorities together

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:06.760
for his administration, he
talked to every faculty member

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:10.280
and was very surprised at how
much these first two points

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:12.040
came up in the conversation.

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:15.010
So he made inclusion one of
the schools five priorities

01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:18.910
and he came to me and asked me
if I would head an initiative.

01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:22.310
And actually he asked me to
head-- he had in mind something

01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:25.110
very similar to what
had been done at MIT,

01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:26.844
and that we would
write a report,

01:00:26.844 --> 01:00:28.260
we would take a
look at ourselves,

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:30.680
and we would make
this report public.

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:32.910
So we've done everything,
but make the report public.

01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:35.560
It's still on the
table that we might,

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:38.030
but it hasn't happened yet.

01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:40.342
So he created the
culture and community

01:00:40.342 --> 01:00:42.050
initiative and a new
leadership position,

01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:43.700
which he appointed me to.

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:48.840
So here's the mission
of that project.

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:51.050
So it's to cultivate
a culture in which

01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:53.250
all members of our community
can thrive and reach

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:54.760
their full potential
for advancing

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:57.270
the mission of the school
without compromising

01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.860
excellence.

01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:00.040
And so all members of our
community, our faculty,

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.930
students, and
staff, and we define

01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:06.000
culture in this--
actually this is

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.989
in the sociological
literature, sociologists

01:01:07.989 --> 01:01:08.780
would recognize it.

01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:12.400
It's basically the way
we do things around here.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:15.030
And the underlying assumptions
of our approach, I think,

01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:17.650
very similar to what
Victoria was saying

01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:20.970
is that we really need to come
together around something that

01:01:20.970 --> 01:01:24.930
lies at the core of what
the organization does

01:01:24.930 --> 01:01:28.090
and what people are invested
in, the reason they're

01:01:28.090 --> 01:01:30.090
in the organization
in the first place.

01:01:30.090 --> 01:01:33.720
And that they actually want
to be held accountable for.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:38.380
So it's really about mission and
purpose and gender disparities.

01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:41.760
So the fact that we saw
these under representation

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:47.580
of women on our
faculty or in grades

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:50.510
that that's an indication
of broader system dynamics.

01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:52.820
So those are
presenting problems,

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:54.460
but those are not
the problems that we

01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:55.870
are oriented to solving.

01:01:55.870 --> 01:01:58.560
We're actually oriented
to advancing something

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:01.280
that is larger and to
advance that we have

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:03.530
to address these other issues.

01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:06.030
So I don't have time
to show you this video

01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:07.630
that I just love of my dean.

01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:13.300
If you just Google
W50 Dean Nohria,

01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:15.030
it's the first two
minutes of the speech

01:02:15.030 --> 01:02:19.330
that he gave at the close of
the summit that we had in 2013,

01:02:19.330 --> 01:02:21.330
which was part of our
commemoration of 50

01:02:21.330 --> 01:02:23.580
years since the admission
of women to Harvard Business

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:24.240
School.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.625
And you'll see a person
who is demonstrating

01:02:26.625 --> 01:02:28.000
incredible commitment
and passion

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.270
and I think that's
really important.

01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:34.070
So let me just say a little
bit about these two projects

01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:34.960
that we undertook.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.360
There's a student culture
project and a faculty culture

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:37.860
project.

01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:40.220
And Susan Sturm and Heidi
Brooks were our collaborators

01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:42.690
with me on the faculty
culture project.

01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:43.970
So I don't have a lot of time.

01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:45.840
I'm going to go
quickly through this,

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:49.240
because I started with the
great gap that was public.

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:51.540
I want to address what
happened around that.

01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:55.020
We did think about as we
undertook this project

01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:56.950
and we were aware of
the gender grade gap.

01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:58.570
It wasn't that we
were just focused

01:02:58.570 --> 01:03:03.670
on-- our mission isn't
really to get good grades;

01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:05.229
our mission is to
educate leaders who

01:03:05.229 --> 01:03:06.520
make a difference in the world.

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:08.410
But we thought
maybe this grade gap

01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:11.490
was an indication of
something else in our culture.

01:03:11.490 --> 01:03:13.844
So this metaphor of
the canary in the coal

01:03:13.844 --> 01:03:15.760
mine-- you send the
canary in, and if it dies,

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.350
there's something toxic
in the environment.

01:03:17.350 --> 01:03:19.641
That was the kind of thing
that we were thinking about.

01:03:19.641 --> 01:03:21.820
That's how we thought
about the grades.

01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:23.820
So we investigated
the causes and I'm

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:25.470
very pleased to
say that after very

01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:28.270
careful quantitative analysis
that was reviewed by just about

01:03:28.270 --> 01:03:31.290
everyone who had an investment
in seeing the results one

01:03:31.290 --> 01:03:35.820
way or another, showed that it
was not student qualifications.

01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:40.680
So the gender coefficient
after we ran the regression,

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.730
adding in absolute
everything you could imagine

01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:43.946
that we could control for.

01:03:43.946 --> 01:03:46.320
Most people thought that that
gender coefficient would go

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:50.380
away once we put in GRE Quant.

01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:53.570
By the way, GRE Verbal is more
highly correlated with it,

01:03:53.570 --> 01:03:56.170
but it turns out
that that coefficient

01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:59.340
went from here to here,
really didn't change at all.

01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:03.220
And that really opened people's
eyes to the fact that gee,

01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:04.750
maybe something was going on.

01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:06.666
I think that was the
most important thing that

01:04:06.666 --> 01:04:09.930
has come out of that project.

01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:15.230
So in the course of this,
we raised awareness.

01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:17.285
So there were a lot
of ongoing practices

01:04:17.285 --> 01:04:19.160
that were designed to
increase effectiveness.

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.760
The New York Times article
talked about these practices

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:24.650
as if we had undertaken
them to close the grade gap.

01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:25.520
That's not true.

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:28.290
We've had a grading tool
for a very long time.

01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:31.060
We've had scribes in and
out of the classroom.

01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:34.260
And we were undertaking
curricular innovations

01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:37.610
as part of another of
the dean's priorities.

01:04:37.610 --> 01:04:39.750
So if you haven't
read the article,

01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:43.840
these are all the
kinds of things

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:46.160
that you could
imagine would help

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:50.600
to address potential faculty
bias in the classroom.

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:56.264
So what I think happened,
because these things had been--

01:04:56.264 --> 01:04:57.930
it wasn't like there
was an intervention

01:04:57.930 --> 01:05:00.430
and then things changed, these
things were always happening,

01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:02.490
but I think that
they were now engaged

01:05:02.490 --> 01:05:05.200
with a lot more
consciousness of gender.

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:07.610
And I think that's
an important lesson

01:05:07.610 --> 01:05:10.820
that there has to really be an
intention around the practices

01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:12.210
that get changed.

01:05:12.210 --> 01:05:14.490
So one indicator of success
is yes, the grade gap

01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:15.367
did diminish.

01:05:15.367 --> 01:05:16.950
I think more
importantly, the students

01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:21.277
are really now owning the
culture change process.

01:05:21.277 --> 01:05:23.360
I'm going to have to go
through this very quickly.

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:29.322
So on the inquiry in the
faculty culture side,

01:05:29.322 --> 01:05:31.530
rather than looking at
quantitative data that we had,

01:05:31.530 --> 01:05:35.210
we hired an external team
that interviewed 120 faculty.

01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:37.210
What I think is
important to note

01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:39.320
about what we did with
respect to this project

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:42.690
as we started out by looking
at the culture of our school.

01:05:42.690 --> 01:05:43.960
That was our real question.

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.240
How does HBS operate?

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:47.290
What are the cultural norms?

01:05:47.290 --> 01:05:49.180
What are the practices?

01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:49.847
Who's thriving?

01:05:49.847 --> 01:05:50.555
Who's succeeding?

01:05:50.555 --> 01:05:52.004
What does it take to thrive?

01:05:52.004 --> 01:05:53.920
And what are the critical
junctures or turning

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.920
points in a person's career?

01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:01.450
And what we know in
probably all organizations,

01:06:01.450 --> 01:06:04.120
but in knowledge
work in particular--

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.940
so this is academia,
yes, but I think

01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:08.570
there is a connection between
what happens at Harvard

01:06:08.570 --> 01:06:10.600
Business School and
academia more generally,

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.304
and what happens
in industries that

01:06:12.304 --> 01:06:14.470
are around knowledge work
professional service firms

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:16.260
and so forth.

01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:20.090
So key experiences around
feedback and evaluation,

01:06:20.090 --> 01:06:24.280
relationships are absolutely
crucial to advancing.

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:27.070
And so these were the
topics of these interviews.

01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:29.719
It wasn't about what's
going on for women.

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:31.760
And by the way, we weren't
just focused on women.

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:33.343
It was a culture and
community project

01:06:33.343 --> 01:06:38.550
so we were really looking
at any sort of groups

01:06:38.550 --> 01:06:40.950
that were systematically
less able to thrive.

01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:42.750
We conducted a
network survey, we

01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:46.760
identify patterns,
and the different ways

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:49.190
that different groups
we're experiencing thriving

01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:50.200
versus not thriving.

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:52.640
It was at that point that
we came in and looked

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:58.870
at race and gender and
other identity differences.

01:06:58.870 --> 01:07:01.210
So the intervention,
the analysis

01:07:01.210 --> 01:07:04.850
was conducted and conveyed
with an eye to action ability.

01:07:04.850 --> 01:07:08.510
Just a quick example, one
thing that people have noticed

01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:12.292
is that women tend to sit
on their working papers.

01:07:12.292 --> 01:07:14.750
You can't get published if you
don't send the working paper

01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:16.640
into a journal.

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:19.320
And so there was this like,
well women are sitting

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:22.650
on their working paper, so the
immediate interpretation is

01:07:22.650 --> 01:07:23.810
well they lack confidence.

01:07:23.810 --> 01:07:25.400
They don't want to send it out.

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:27.430
That's not so actionable.

01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:29.690
What are we going
to do about that?

01:07:29.690 --> 01:07:33.782
What was really important was
to say, well why are they not.

01:07:33.782 --> 01:07:36.240
And then to get some sense of
well who are they talking to.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:39.450
Well, actually a lot of them
are disconnected from faculty,

01:07:39.450 --> 01:07:44.740
from senior faculty who can
help them shape their papers.

01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:48.654
And help them figure out
when it's time to send it in.

01:07:48.654 --> 01:07:50.570
And so we think that
maybe there was something

01:07:50.570 --> 01:07:52.690
gendered like that going on.

01:07:52.690 --> 01:07:55.210
We shared the full report
with the faculty, again.

01:07:55.210 --> 01:07:58.080
It's a consciousness
raising story.

01:07:58.080 --> 01:07:59.590
And what we've been
doing since then

01:07:59.590 --> 01:08:03.530
is basically identifying what
we call high leverage task

01:08:03.530 --> 01:08:07.529
domains, where we
can experiment.

01:08:07.529 --> 01:08:09.570
OK, we've got this whole
story about our culture.

01:08:09.570 --> 01:08:12.860
We see how it operates
differently, systematically

01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:15.200
differently for different
groups including women,

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.300
but other groups as well.

01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:19.151
So where are really
the pain points?

01:08:19.151 --> 01:08:21.609
Nobody's going to undertake to
change a culture, especially

01:08:21.609 --> 01:08:24.090
when-- by the way we love our
culture at Harvard Business

01:08:24.090 --> 01:08:28.620
School, but we recognize
that there are some issues.

01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:31.220
So it's really important
to identify where is it

01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:36.149
that people have energy
for changing things.

01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:41.060
And where is there actually
leadership in the organization

01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:43.859
to take up some of
these experiments.

01:08:43.859 --> 01:08:46.577
And so that's what
we've been doing.

01:08:46.577 --> 01:08:48.910
I don't have time to speak
about some of the experiments

01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:51.350
around developing
teaching skill.

01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:53.297
It turns out that that's
a big leverage point.

01:08:53.297 --> 01:08:55.130
It's a place where a
lot of people fall off,

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:56.189
both men and women.

01:08:56.189 --> 01:08:58.859
But it might be
disproportionately women

01:08:58.859 --> 01:09:00.270
for a variety of reasons.

01:09:00.270 --> 01:09:02.060
And so experimenting
with different ways

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:04.819
of teaching people
how to teach and that

01:09:04.819 --> 01:09:07.250
seems to be quite effective.

01:09:07.250 --> 01:09:10.750
So I'm not going to be able
to-- I've gone way over.

01:09:10.750 --> 01:09:13.798
So you can just read these.

01:09:13.798 --> 01:09:15.140
And that's it.

01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:16.314
Thank you very much.

01:09:23.399 --> 01:09:24.250
-Thank you, Robin.

01:09:24.250 --> 01:09:28.350
That was a very weighty
and meaty and content rich

01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:29.880
presentation.

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:31.430
I don't know how
many of you know,

01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:34.930
but the ambient
temperature in companies

01:09:34.930 --> 01:09:39.340
was set for the comfort of the
man in the gray flannel suit

01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:41.569
and it has not changed.

01:09:41.569 --> 01:09:43.840
And also there's
data that suggests

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:47.870
that fathers are considered
more committed to their work

01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:50.930
when they're fathers, rather
than when they're single.

01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:54.540
Whereas mothers are
considered less committed,

01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:56.604
which is interesting--
plays right

01:09:56.604 --> 01:09:57.770
into the gender stereotypes.

01:09:57.770 --> 01:10:02.010
But Robin, I would love to
continue your conversation

01:10:02.010 --> 01:10:02.510
there.

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:10.550
Quick question is, you
mentioned that married women had

01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:14.840
less of a grade gap than
unmarried women in class.

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:17.910
And I was married
when I was at HBS.

01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:18.770
-You were safe.

01:10:18.770 --> 01:10:21.100
-Yes, I was safe.

01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:23.310
If you could give me a quick
answer on that and then

01:10:23.310 --> 01:10:24.340
I have another question.

01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:26.650
-Yeah, so we were having
just a sidebar conversation.

01:10:26.650 --> 01:10:28.358
It wasn't something
I mentioned, but it's

01:10:28.358 --> 01:10:30.040
true that in these
quantitative analyses

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:33.400
what we learned is that
there was no grade gap

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:37.580
and had not been between
married women and men.

01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:41.980
And so when I saw that actually,
my immediate thought was OK,

01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:43.690
so clearly it's the culture.

01:10:43.690 --> 01:10:46.160
I mean like how can
you-- like what?

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.270
Married women are smarter?

01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:48.757
I don't know.

01:10:48.757 --> 01:10:50.840
It's interesting though
that some of my colleagues

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:52.281
actually looked
at that and said,

01:10:52.281 --> 01:10:53.780
well it's obviously
not the culture.

01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:56.900
Immediately had a very
different reaction to it

01:10:56.900 --> 01:11:00.020
and believed that it was
because married women were more

01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:02.820
committed than unmarried women.

01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:05.210
So we actually took
a look at that.

01:11:05.210 --> 01:11:08.900
And we compared married
and unmarried women,

01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:11.370
and married and unmarried men.

01:11:11.370 --> 01:11:13.060
The only thing we
really had access to,

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:15.820
which was how that might
indicate commitment

01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:18.600
was how many hours
they spent studying,

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:22.640
which we asked them to report
at the end of each course

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:24.610
on average for that course.

01:11:24.610 --> 01:11:28.240
And then we also
ask them how much

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:31.480
previous knowledge did you
have of the course so forth.

01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:35.550
And we found that
actually women, all women

01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:37.990
studied more than men.

01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:39.720
But it wasn't just
the married women.

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:41.984
So single women were
actually-- it wasn't a lot,

01:11:41.984 --> 01:11:43.400
it was something
like six minutes.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:46.410
But was statistically
significant

01:11:46.410 --> 01:11:47.910
that single women
were studying more

01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:50.920
than men, which suggested
that that wasn't the problem.

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:54.450
So my sense is it has
something to do this competence

01:11:54.450 --> 01:11:55.830
likeability trade off.

01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:58.730
And also the fact that
I think that sexism

01:11:58.730 --> 01:12:01.372
in our culture in
general, and not

01:12:01.372 --> 01:12:03.580
going to be any different
at Harvard Business School,

01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:05.110
it's going to be
more likely to be

01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:08.740
directed toward young single
women and young married women.

01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:11.180
And I think those are
the kinds of environments

01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:15.100
that make it hard to
actually thrive and reach

01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:15.870
your potential.

01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:19.040
So I think that that
would be my explanation.

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:20.000
-Very interesting.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.960
So as you mentioned,
HBS is the school

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:26.640
that's closest to industry.

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:30.720
And are there any plans to
take this wonderful research,

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:34.820
because the phrase I
always heard is we're

01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:37.350
training the titans of industry.

01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:41.000
So is there any
plan to take what

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.060
you've learned within HBS
with the baby titans in there,

01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:50.760
to take it out to the
big grownup titans

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:55.120
and have them also
learn and change

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:58.090
from what you have discovered.

01:12:58.090 --> 01:13:03.200
-Yeah, so I even though this is
one of my administrative roles

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:05.330
at the school now is the
senior associate dean

01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:07.850
for culture and community
working on this project,

01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:10.065
but I think of it
as my research.

01:13:10.065 --> 01:13:12.680
It actually makes me feel
better that I'm doing research

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.290
when I'm doing it.

01:13:14.290 --> 01:13:17.140
But to me it is, if it's
action research it's something

01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:21.754
that Susan Sturm and I are
planning to write about.

01:13:21.754 --> 01:13:23.920
I shouldn't say that so
loud, because it's upsetting

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:25.670
to some of my colleagues.

01:13:25.670 --> 01:13:28.260
We are hoping to and as I
said it's still on the table.

01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:30.820
So we are beginning
to talk about it.

01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:33.610
I have talked to companies.

01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:36.070
And I would love as part
of the gender initiative

01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:38.350
that we've started- that's
a research initiative,

01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:40.080
it's a outward
facing, it has nothing

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:42.460
to do with the internal
dynamics of our school.

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:45.060
But to use that as an
opportunity to link up

01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:48.320
with companies to work with
them around some of the things

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:54.270
that we've learned
and perhaps maybe

01:13:54.270 --> 01:13:56.030
even in the form of
executive education,

01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:58.820
but also action research
in their companies.

01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:00.110
So that's the idea.

01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:00.610
-Great.

01:14:00.610 --> 01:14:01.710
Thank you.

01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:08.470
Ann, do you think that
biotech needs a rallying cry

01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:12.890
around a lean-in, sort of
a Sheryl Sandberg approach?

01:14:12.890 --> 01:14:16.610
Do you think that we are also
not utilizing social media,

01:14:16.610 --> 01:14:18.360
because that's not
our business, we're

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:23.090
tech companies are very much
and imbued with the importance

01:14:23.090 --> 01:14:24.700
of social media.

01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:28.410
Should we be taking a
leaf out of their books

01:14:28.410 --> 01:14:31.890
and using social
media to mobilize,

01:14:31.890 --> 01:14:34.370
to bring up the problems,
because it really

01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:35.960
stays within biotech.

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:38.600
It hasn't permeated
the way that everybody

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.690
knows a problem in tech.

01:14:40.690 --> 01:14:45.780
So are these some of the
things that might help?

01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:51.480
-So on the rallying cry, I think
with the more recent movements

01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:53.350
that I had mentioned,
I do think there's

01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:55.740
a building swell around that.

01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:59.700
But in absence of tying it as
we've noted to the business

01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:04.430
outcome or some specific
sets of data that indicates

01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:07.530
to your stakeholders why
it is you need to do this,

01:15:07.530 --> 01:15:10.700
I think it will fall
and will fall flat.

01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:15.520
So I think a cry that
is educated by examples

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:18.890
of improved business outcomes,
I think, could be very powerful,

01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:22.600
but in that context.

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:28.970
On the social media front,
I'm sort of two minds.

01:15:28.970 --> 01:15:31.940
And in one sense I
don't necessarily

01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:35.060
think that the addition
of social media

01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:38.680
will profoundly
impact the problem.

01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:41.890
I think primarily in
my view of the biotech,

01:15:41.890 --> 01:15:44.410
where I operate in the
biotech world, which

01:15:44.410 --> 01:15:47.520
is this early stage
little animal,

01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:49.650
everyone kind of
knows everybody.

01:15:49.650 --> 01:15:52.380
So I'm not sure what the
addition of social media

01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:58.340
would be, because it's such
a relatively small club.

01:15:58.340 --> 01:16:01.510
So I say that
acknowledging that we

01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:04.320
want to try to bring
new participants in

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:08.180
and especially, I think there's
the additional consideration

01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:12.570
of the numbers of
people and certain age

01:16:12.570 --> 01:16:14.940
groups within the
United States and what

01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:18.390
the demographics and
population of the US look like.

01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:22.660
And I think getting
younger people involved

01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:26.900
in biotech, who may not
be the CEOs at the stage

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:27.770
that they're at.

01:16:27.770 --> 01:16:30.800
I think using social
media to attract them,

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:34.440
and again, on the line
of recruitment pipeline

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:37.970
and providing appropriate
sort of mentorship,

01:16:37.970 --> 01:16:43.100
role models, marketing, I think
on that line it could be used.

01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:46.730
But I'm not enough of a social
media or marketing person

01:16:46.730 --> 01:16:47.485
to really comment.

01:16:47.485 --> 01:16:49.190
-So I'm going to
push you on that,

01:16:49.190 --> 01:16:51.270
and maybe it's just
my West Coast bias.

01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:58.730
But the small club, which I
know well and I'm part of-- yes,

01:16:58.730 --> 01:17:01.950
they know it and not highly
motivated do a whole lot.

01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:04.850
But I think when it comes
under the bright light

01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:10.060
of other people who are not
insiders, but are actually

01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:17.850
critical it might have
some kind of impact,

01:17:17.850 --> 01:17:22.030
and more importantly for
institutional venture

01:17:22.030 --> 01:17:24.310
funds, who have to
go to institutions

01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:29.200
to raise money unlike the luxury
of a corporate venture fund.

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:32.760
I think there to having--
because it's an ecosystem.

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:36.390
I think bringing that more
attention might do something.

01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:38.970
So perhaps you
should do a lean in

01:17:38.970 --> 01:17:44.980
or a biotech version of
whatever the right analogy is.

01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:46.900
-Very fair.

01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:52.310
-Victoria, we've all talked
about the business case

01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:57.715
and it's clear that
the business case

01:17:57.715 --> 01:17:59.840
has to be there when you're
talking about industry,

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:04.090
because policy
alone will not fly.

01:18:04.090 --> 01:18:08.230
Could you describe
to us what data

01:18:08.230 --> 01:18:14.140
you use to make
the business case?

01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:18.390
I've seen the publication on
the number of women on boards

01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:22.020
becoming-- that's
just one study though.

01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:24.405
It's the one that I hear
over and over again.

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:29.820
Is there enough
of a body of data

01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:34.190
that you can muster to make
your business case compelling?

01:18:34.190 --> 01:18:36.140
-It's a really good question.

01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:37.290
So two things.

01:18:37.290 --> 01:18:40.060
And before I talk specifically
about the business case,

01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:42.380
I wanted to circle back
to one of the discussions

01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:46.820
that we've had having to do with
navigating the system, which

01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:49.690
is another way of
saying fixing the women.

01:18:49.690 --> 01:18:52.470
And when we talk about
women not asking,

01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:56.380
or women tilting their heads,
or women diminishing self

01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:59.230
when they present--
women do this

01:18:59.230 --> 01:19:02.350
not because they
lack confidence,

01:19:02.350 --> 01:19:03.930
but because they're
effective tools

01:19:03.930 --> 01:19:06.469
for navigating a
culture with incredibly

01:19:06.469 --> 01:19:07.510
high social repercussion.

01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:14.200
And our studies really show
that when women negotiate

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:17.890
that first job offer--
even if successful,

01:19:17.890 --> 01:19:20.990
they are viewed as something
that rhymes with itch.

01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:25.410
And it's not just a view, it's
actioned in the corporation.

01:19:25.410 --> 01:19:28.320
People don't want
to work with them.

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:31.340
Whereas, when a man
negotiates the first offer,

01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:35.980
it doesn't in any way conflict
with the cultural stereotype

01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:38.780
of him being a good man.

01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:41.730
Now, some of my colleagues,
like Hannah Riley Bowles,

01:19:41.730 --> 01:19:44.330
again, looked at what Robin
highlighted, which is the why.

01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:52.020
So what we find is that
if we have a conversation,

01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:54.970
and if I'm talking to Anula,
and she's the hiring manager,

01:19:54.970 --> 01:19:59.680
and I use a script that
is highly relational,

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:01.690
I diminish the backlash affect.

01:20:01.690 --> 01:20:04.860
If I said, Anula, thank
you so much for that offer,

01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:08.050
I'm incredibly looking forward
to working together and being

01:20:08.050 --> 01:20:11.160
on your team, do you think
we could work together,

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:13.030
I know from looking
at other industry

01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:18.480
reports and my background that
10% higher than that offer

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:19.560
would seem appropriate.

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:22.620
Could we do that together?

01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:25.980
I'm not saying that's a
script one should need,

01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:28.100
but it is a script
which is effective,

01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:31.800
even for those of us who would
say, Anula, I can't imagine

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:33.770
working with a woman
who's more high powered

01:20:33.770 --> 01:20:37.740
and effective in the field--
looking forward to it,

01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:39.810
I'm worth more.

01:20:39.810 --> 01:20:42.940
But that script, not helpful.

01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:46.120
Anti female in terms of how
it lives in people's minds.

01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:48.090
So I just want us to
be conscious in all

01:20:48.090 --> 01:20:50.240
of our conversation
that patterns

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:54.940
you see women replicating
are there for reasons.

01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:56.780
And when you're going
to change that pattern

01:20:56.780 --> 01:20:58.900
you really better
understand what

01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:01.730
is the unintended
consequence of that change,

01:21:01.730 --> 01:21:03.840
and why have those
patterns been developed,

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:06.980
whether that's broadly
within the culture

01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:09.800
or specifically in
your organization.

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:11.922
If you see women leaving
at a particular point,

01:21:11.922 --> 01:21:13.880
you need to do some good
research to understand

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:15.860
what's going on at that point.

01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:20.230
And the whole discussion
about opt out; what we know

01:21:20.230 --> 01:21:24.060
is women who leave those high
powered positions are not

01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:27.770
out for more than two
years at the very outset.

01:21:27.770 --> 01:21:31.530
They go back in, so we're
not seeing an opt out.

01:21:31.530 --> 01:21:34.530
What we're seeing is
a push out and a this

01:21:34.530 --> 01:21:35.940
isn't working for me.

01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:38.470
And that's about systems
design and the losers

01:21:38.470 --> 01:21:40.900
aren't only women who
are underemployed;

01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:44.010
the loser's the firm that
invested their time, talent,

01:21:44.010 --> 01:21:45.510
and money.

01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:51.430
So your question about
the business case-- so

01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:57.320
the business case we have
mixed data on women on boards.

01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:00.390
We have very clear
data-- think Scott Page

01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:02.690
University of
Michigan-- indicating

01:22:02.690 --> 01:22:06.400
that when you have
complex problems to solve,

01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:12.815
diversity enables you to do
much better outcome production.

01:22:12.815 --> 01:22:16.060
You have a complex problem--
diversity of field,

01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:22.180
diversity of experience,
diversity of talent, culture,

01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:23.150
you name it.

01:22:23.150 --> 01:22:24.740
Much more effective.

01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:26.990
Now when we talk
about a business case,

01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:29.700
the majority of consumers
and consumer decision

01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:31.620
making even on things
that are thought

01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:36.980
of as male oriented tasks,
like purchasing cars, female.

01:22:36.980 --> 01:22:39.910
When we think about who
is in the control seat--

01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:42.082
largest growing market
in the United States,

01:22:42.082 --> 01:22:43.790
does anyone know what
the demographic is?

01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:49.550
Shout it out, guys.

01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:50.650
Not just women, Latina.

01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:56.770
Every city in the United
States, if it isn't already,

01:22:56.770 --> 01:23:00.880
in the next 10 to 15 years
will be majority minority.

01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:03.020
When you talk about
wanting to sell a product

01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:06.280
or service in the United
States, if you do not understand

01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:08.410
who the United States
is your business

01:23:08.410 --> 01:23:12.300
is very unlikely to succeed.

01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:16.430
When we had the opening
discussion and Dan talked

01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:19.810
about the experience
at the FDA, that

01:23:19.810 --> 01:23:22.020
is the experience of
what talent in America

01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:24.120
is going to look like.

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:26.730
Now note there's some
huge downsides to that.

01:23:26.730 --> 01:23:30.950
It is a crisis that boys are
being under-served in school.

01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:34.520
It's not my area of expertise,
it's not something I focus on.

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:37.142
There are people who
are focused on this.

01:23:37.142 --> 01:23:39.771
This is an enormous problem.

01:23:39.771 --> 01:23:41.770
And if you think of how
dynamics have played out

01:23:41.770 --> 01:23:45.340
in particular communities,
where you have females who

01:23:45.340 --> 01:23:48.930
are much more highly educated,
who have much higher income

01:23:48.930 --> 01:23:51.410
levels, have much
greater social mobility--

01:23:51.410 --> 01:23:54.730
the African American community
in the United States.

01:23:54.730 --> 01:24:00.100
And now all of those issues,
which people inappropriately

01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:03.590
view as focus on that
ethnicity, they're

01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:06.980
focused on what
opportunities are.

01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:08.560
And where the
gatekeepers have been

01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:10.310
and now math that more broadly.

01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:14.010
These are very serious issues
that have to be addressed.

01:24:14.010 --> 01:24:16.560
However, where we are today
having our conversation

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:18.890
about gender and
biotech, when we

01:24:18.890 --> 01:24:20.400
look at what the
business case is,

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:23.400
the talent management
case is very clear.

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:25.840
The market share
case is very clear

01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:28.520
and the efficiency
case is very clear.

01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:31.730
It is expensive to have
talent that you've already

01:24:31.730 --> 01:24:37.340
purchased and invested in and
they're not fully utilized.

01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:40.330
You had talked about Amy
Cuddy's work on motherhood.

01:24:40.330 --> 01:24:43.240
This is a perfect example.

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:44.660
And we've had a
lot of discussion

01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:47.906
about women's behavioral
choices-- two steps back.

01:24:47.906 --> 01:24:48.780
These aren't choices.

01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:52.810
If I give you a menu with
four things on it and I say,

01:24:52.810 --> 01:24:54.690
you're welcome to
eat any of these

01:24:54.690 --> 01:24:57.520
for the rest of your life.

01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:00.030
You would not feel
that you made choices.

01:25:00.030 --> 01:25:01.470
You would feel
you selected among

01:25:01.470 --> 01:25:03.310
a constrained environment.

01:25:03.310 --> 01:25:05.840
The way most workplaces
look in the United States

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.680
for most employees,
they're selecting

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:10.060
among constrained environments.

01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:12.320
We're the only
country in the world

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:15.990
that has no mandatory
form of paid leave.

01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:18.810
Workers are not guaranteed
by statute a single day

01:25:18.810 --> 01:25:21.100
of sick leave.

01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:25.060
Our structural set up
creates an inefficiency

01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:27.150
within our talent market.

01:25:27.150 --> 01:25:30.270
So we could go on, but
that gives you the--

01:25:30.270 --> 01:25:37.560
-So may I ask you, Robin,
do you buy the idea

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:43.150
that Victoria brought up, women
are the biggest decision makers

01:25:43.150 --> 01:25:44.070
in health care?

01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:47.650
They research the web more
than four times as much as men

01:25:47.650 --> 01:25:49.100
to get information.

01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:52.340
They make decisions,
they hold the purse,

01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:58.060
and they also take care of
their kids, and they're parents.

01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:02.190
So they are making the
majority of decisions.

01:26:02.190 --> 01:26:06.480
Why has that not become
a compelling business

01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:10.940
case for companies
in life sciences

01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:22.230
to look at that as
a target market?

01:26:22.230 --> 01:26:23.507
-I don't really know.

01:26:26.430 --> 01:26:30.100
I think there's all
the things that we've

01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:34.820
been talking about in the first
panel and the second panel.

01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:36.930
A lot of it is irrational.

01:26:36.930 --> 01:26:41.320
To hold gender stereotypes
in the face of reality

01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:43.410
is irrational.

01:26:43.410 --> 01:26:46.020
So I mean that's a
longer conversation.

01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:48.430
What is the unconscious
dynamic going on?

01:26:48.430 --> 01:26:51.760
Why are people so
invested in believing

01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:55.440
that gender stereotypes are
true when there's unbelievably

01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:00.830
little evidence to support it?

01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:02.810
I guess that's what I would--

01:27:02.810 --> 01:27:03.560
-Thank you.

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:06.120
I'm way over time on the panel.

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:11.420
May I now invite the audience
to pose questions to the panel.

01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:13.520
So please come up
to the microphone

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:18.931
and identify yourselves
and your affiliation.

01:27:18.931 --> 01:27:19.430
Thank you.

01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:22.570
And also feel free to identify
the panelists to whom you'd

01:27:22.570 --> 01:27:24.614
like to address your question.

01:27:24.614 --> 01:27:25.990
Go ahead.

01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.490
-Hi.

01:27:26.490 --> 01:27:27.940
My name is [INAUDIBLE].

01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:31.570
I'm actually a senior here at
Harvard studying economics.

01:27:31.570 --> 01:27:34.240
Thank you all for coming
here and speaking to us.

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:37.830
I was wondering what do you
think is the most important

01:27:37.830 --> 01:27:41.150
for women, who are especially
in the early stages

01:27:41.150 --> 01:27:42.780
of their career to know.

01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:45.340
And what do you
think women can do

01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:48.070
to ensure that they're
getting enough guidance

01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:53.640
and mentorship, especially
given that a lot of this people

01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:55.660
in senior positions our men.

01:27:58.750 --> 01:27:59.350
-OK.

01:27:59.350 --> 01:28:01.050
So four quick things.

01:28:01.050 --> 01:28:07.520
One, when you seek out networks
and mentors and sponsors

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:10.140
you need to find people who
don't just look like you.

01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:12.020
Women tend to
benchmark and level

01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:14.290
set against other people
who are like them.

01:28:14.290 --> 01:28:15.380
Everybody does it.

01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:17.380
But you don't want to put
yourself in a position

01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:20.440
where you're not getting
information from people who may

01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:22.210
have more access to networks.

01:28:22.210 --> 01:28:25.020
Two, your job at
this stage of life

01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:27.820
is to make choices that
give you as many open doors

01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:29.970
in the future as possible.

01:28:29.970 --> 01:28:32.080
So even among
specializing you want

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:34.980
to make choices that give
you more choices ahead.

01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:38.480
Three, listen,
collect information,

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:41.990
however, trust your
own instincts and gut.

01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:43.770
Don't let anybody
tell you otherwise.

01:28:43.770 --> 01:28:47.390
You are the only person
who's the CEO of your life.

01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:48.816
Admire and respect yourself.

01:28:48.816 --> 01:28:50.940
And figure out what do you
want to do and pursue it

01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:53.020
tenaciously.

01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:57.000
And lastly, really look at
different industries and then

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.960
different organizations
and see how people who do

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:02.130
look like you fair there.

01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:04.890
Don't be deterred,
but understand

01:29:04.890 --> 01:29:08.580
what choices you're making
and the amount of tenacity

01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:10.230
and rallying and
resources it may

01:29:10.230 --> 01:29:15.130
take to achieve there so
that you are ready to do it.

01:29:15.130 --> 01:29:21.300
-I have been a bad moderator
in that I've exceeded time.

01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:25.270
So, therefore, could everybody
please ask one quick question.

01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:30.570
And could the answers also
be fast; this is my request.

01:29:30.570 --> 01:29:31.310
Go ahead.

01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:32.512
-OK, I'm going to try.

01:29:32.512 --> 01:29:33.470
I'm Lauren [INAUDIBLE].

01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:35.952
I'm a postdoc in systems
biology at Harvard.

01:29:35.952 --> 01:29:37.410
And my question is
kind of prompted

01:29:37.410 --> 01:29:41.820
by Ann's discussion of the
market value of biotech

01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:44.150
recently and that these
people are raking in the cash.

01:29:47.140 --> 01:29:50.520
I was thinking is this the
value we need or want to promote

01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:55.357
and will women in leadership
help us reassess this value.

01:29:55.357 --> 01:29:57.190
Because women are like
the traditionally the

01:29:57.190 --> 01:30:00.560
subjugated class and are subject
to the consequences of power.

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:04.090
So it's kind of question.

01:30:04.090 --> 01:30:04.590
-Ann.

01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:11.340
-Wow, I feel like I'm
loaded either way.

01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:19.290
OK, so I think I'll
answer it this way.

01:30:19.290 --> 01:30:21.510
People will come to
me and say, how do you

01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:23.420
get a job in venture?

01:30:23.420 --> 01:30:27.270
Really love technology, I love
science, I could sit all day

01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:28.670
and find like compelling stuff.

01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:32.520
That's great.

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:34.200
And then I have
to break it them.

01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:37.380
If you're looking for a job
in institutional venture, what

01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:42.120
happens is you need to get
someone to write you a check

01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:45.610
and you need to hand them
cash back preferably much,

01:30:45.610 --> 01:30:49.150
much more than
what they gave you.

01:30:49.150 --> 01:30:51.300
And stop.

01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:54.085
There are some constraints
that LPs may put on funds,

01:30:54.085 --> 01:30:57.990
but by and large,
that's the profession.

01:30:57.990 --> 01:31:01.880
So we'll separate that out.

01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:08.070
If you look at the pharma
and biotech industry,

01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:10.090
what are they in the
business of doing?

01:31:10.090 --> 01:31:14.190
Well, they need to generate
profit and revenue, but the way

01:31:14.190 --> 01:31:17.770
that they do that is by
making products ideally

01:31:17.770 --> 01:31:20.110
that transform patients' lives.

01:31:20.110 --> 01:31:22.180
So depending on
sort of where you

01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:24.820
are in the context
of that organization,

01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:28.370
I think the Genzyme is
a prime example of this;

01:31:28.370 --> 01:31:31.220
it was and even
the Sanofi CEO, who

01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:36.810
just started about 120 days ago,
his first town hall at Genzyem,

01:31:36.810 --> 01:31:39.990
the Sanofi CEO said to
the Genzyme leadership,

01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:42.246
you are a mission
driven organization

01:31:42.246 --> 01:31:43.870
that is very different
than what I have

01:31:43.870 --> 01:31:45.800
seen in other parts of Sanofi.

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:48.750
And the mission is
patients' lives.

01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:52.600
So I think depending on where
you go in the ecosystem,

01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:56.340
you can readily understand what
is the business outcome they're

01:31:56.340 --> 01:31:57.370
trying to achieve.

01:31:57.370 --> 01:32:02.250
And what are the tools
available to them to get there.

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:06.350
I think that might
help in making choices.

01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:07.010
-Thank you.

01:32:07.010 --> 01:32:09.370
I have a question
for the organizers.

01:32:09.370 --> 01:32:12.030
I just want to know
whether we can accommodate

01:32:12.030 --> 01:32:15.160
the long line that's
forming there, because if I

01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:17.240
do any math whatsoever.

01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:18.270
It's not working out.

01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:26.740
OK, so we would please ask
no one else to join the line,

01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:28.972
but we will be delighted
to accommodate everybody

01:32:28.972 --> 01:32:29.930
who's already up there.

01:32:29.930 --> 01:32:31.529
Please go ahead.

01:32:31.529 --> 01:32:32.570
-Hello, my name is Daisy.

01:32:32.570 --> 01:32:39.450
I am just defended my PhD
at MIT couple of months ago.

01:32:39.450 --> 01:32:41.974
My question kind
of relates to what

01:32:41.974 --> 01:32:43.390
we heard in the
first panel, which

01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:46.270
is that women, the matter
of their attractiveness

01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:49.890
are less likely to get funding
for their entrepreneurial goals

01:32:49.890 --> 01:32:52.220
than attractive men overall.

01:32:52.220 --> 01:32:57.100
So we have a lot of information
about the overall big picture,

01:32:57.100 --> 01:33:00.910
what we can do to improve
things in the long term.

01:33:00.910 --> 01:33:05.150
But more immediately, what
can female entrepreneurs

01:33:05.150 --> 01:33:09.640
do to get their odds to
the same level as men.

01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:12.420
Do you just have to be
better no matter what?

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:15.210
Or can you actually
just get an idea

01:33:15.210 --> 01:33:18.189
that's as good as somebody else
and actually have a chance.

01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:23.890
-Ann.

01:33:23.890 --> 01:33:27.040
-So I will lead, but I will
defer to my other colleagues

01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:30.070
to provide me data support.

01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:32.720
But I think the evidence
is by and large, you

01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:35.130
do have to be better.

01:33:35.130 --> 01:33:37.580
So you've got a bigger job.

01:33:37.580 --> 01:33:41.470
I'd say from an
investment perspective,

01:33:41.470 --> 01:33:46.270
if the question is around
approaching investors,

01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:51.440
it's a relatively small set
of people who are investors.

01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:56.640
You can usually get to know what
it is that investor's about,

01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:00.380
for example, find out who
else they have invested in.

01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:02.660
And I would talk
with those people

01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:05.470
in whom they've
invested to figure out

01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:08.310
what is that person about.

01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:10.710
Because if you take
money from someone,

01:34:10.710 --> 01:34:14.210
if you're sort of getting
married, because at some point

01:34:14.210 --> 01:34:17.210
money will go back and
you're now in a long term--

01:34:17.210 --> 01:34:20.410
if it's venture, you're in at
least sort of a 10 year fund

01:34:20.410 --> 01:34:23.380
relationship around that money.

01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:27.370
And ideally those do become
marriages with the wedding day

01:34:27.370 --> 01:34:29.390
on the day the financing closes.

01:34:29.390 --> 01:34:32.290
So I think really
understanding those investors

01:34:32.290 --> 01:34:34.260
that you want to
approach and who

01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:36.160
you would contemplate
taking their money,

01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:39.310
I think is an important element.

01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:41.780
And understanding, I think,
it's relevant to look

01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:44.670
in their portfolios to see
if they have ever invested

01:34:44.670 --> 01:34:48.810
in a management team that looks
like a team that you think

01:34:48.810 --> 01:34:51.650
might be reflective of
what you want to build.

01:34:51.650 --> 01:34:52.935
-Thank you.

01:34:52.935 --> 01:34:54.210
-That was great advice.

01:34:54.210 --> 01:34:55.660
-Hi, my name is Jen [INAUDIBLE].

01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:59.340
I'm a postdoc at the
Center for Integration

01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:01.580
of Science and Industry
at Bentley University.

01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:03.940
And my question goes
to what Victoria

01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:05.930
was talking about with framing.

01:35:05.930 --> 01:35:10.660
And how do we go from
the large tendency

01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:14.190
to highlight research
noting gender inequality

01:35:14.190 --> 01:35:19.450
to the research that highlights
the benefits of gender

01:35:19.450 --> 01:35:20.370
diversity.

01:35:20.370 --> 01:35:23.270
And what can we do to promote
that feeling in the same way

01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:25.970
that corporate social
responsibility standards helped

01:35:25.970 --> 01:35:29.980
improve sustainability
views in industry?

01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:31.000
-Great question.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.150
A few things are coming.

01:35:32.150 --> 01:35:34.650
I mean, one, if you look
across-- thinking about boards,

01:35:34.650 --> 01:35:37.890
if one looks across Europe
and the rest of the world,

01:35:37.890 --> 01:35:40.640
the reality is there's
a huge regulatory frame,

01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:42.810
and it's coming.

01:35:42.810 --> 01:35:46.300
Most of the major
multinationals-- everyone's

01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:47.890
got a foothold everywhere.

01:35:47.890 --> 01:35:51.240
Impact and pressures there
are going to resonate.

01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:54.390
What we're also saying
and I had participated

01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:56.630
in some of the architecture
around is really

01:35:56.630 --> 01:35:59.420
looking at federal contracting.

01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:03.440
So long story short, you're
not out there all alone.

01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:05.020
And more is going
to come and it's

01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:09.540
about really knowing the
research well, and discussing

01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:11.120
all the facets of it.

01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:16.220
And holding your institutions
accountable, realistically.

01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:17.790
You are not the only
female scientist

01:36:17.790 --> 01:36:20.380
currently in your field
that your program, correct?

01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:22.630
-No.

01:36:22.630 --> 01:36:26.220
-Have as many allies and don't
presume men won't be allies.

01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:31.230
Ask for things and frames,
which aren't only around gender.

01:36:31.230 --> 01:36:34.210
Thank the heck out of people
when you get what you want,

01:36:34.210 --> 01:36:36.010
and expect it.

01:36:36.010 --> 01:36:36.760
And expected it.

01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:38.710
And choose wisely,
which battles you fight.

01:36:38.710 --> 01:36:41.080
You do not fight
battles, in my view,

01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:44.990
when you're
negotiating for a job.

01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:47.840
You fight battles that you can
win then for what you need.

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:51.440
And then once you're
inside you work on.

01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:53.550
There are times
to be rebellious,

01:36:53.550 --> 01:36:56.231
and rebellious is not when
you're negotiating yourself,

01:36:56.231 --> 01:36:56.730
right?

01:36:56.730 --> 01:36:59.450
That's a time when you
want an external validator.

01:36:59.450 --> 01:37:01.820
-Thank you.

01:37:01.820 --> 01:37:03.450
-Hi, my name is
Amanda [INAUDIBLE].

01:37:03.450 --> 01:37:06.660
I'm a grad student at MIT
in computational biology.

01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:08.530
Thank you to all
the speakers today.

01:37:08.530 --> 01:37:11.350
We've heard multiple
times today about how

01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:14.000
women experience marriage
and motherhood differently

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.800
than men in the workplace.

01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:18.389
And I've seen a lot of data
recently about millennials

01:37:18.389 --> 01:37:20.430
and younger generations
are ranking this as a lot

01:37:20.430 --> 01:37:23.000
less important to
them for their future.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.790
So my question is, what
is a situation currently

01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:27.950
for women who were unmarried
or don't have kids?

01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:29.491
And how do you think
that will change

01:37:29.491 --> 01:37:32.230
as that demographic grows?

01:37:32.230 --> 01:37:36.960
-Do you have any
data on this topic?

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:40.840
-Well, I thought you were
going to go someplace else.

01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:48.240
What I've seen, first of all,
is that companies are not--

01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:51.710
they're not oriented to
recognizing or supporting

01:37:51.710 --> 01:38:00.517
men's very strong commitments
to actually being caretakers

01:38:00.517 --> 01:38:01.600
and not just breadwinners.

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:04.520
So I just want to say that,
I think if you actually

01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:08.080
look at what people's experience
is, men are having a very

01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:10.770
hard time, not just
millennials are having

01:38:10.770 --> 01:38:14.309
a very hard time managing
the requirements meant

01:38:14.309 --> 01:38:16.225
for professionals that
they be available 24/7.

01:38:18.970 --> 01:38:21.040
I think what I've
seen in my research

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:25.950
on this among single
women is that it's

01:38:25.950 --> 01:38:30.350
almost as if the
organization is sort of set

01:38:30.350 --> 01:38:34.850
up almost not to recognize the
possibility of single women

01:38:34.850 --> 01:38:36.530
or women without children.

01:38:36.530 --> 01:38:38.830
And so women do--
they do it's just

01:38:38.830 --> 01:38:40.716
kind of get grouped together.

01:38:40.716 --> 01:38:42.340
It's sort of like
that's who women are.

01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:44.260
They're understood
as someone who

01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:47.700
will be either is a mother and
that means a certain thing,

01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:52.490
or who will and wants to
be and will be a mother.

01:38:52.490 --> 01:38:54.940
But your question was, what
do you do about that, right?

01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:55.440
Yeah.

01:39:03.210 --> 01:39:04.360
-I have an answer to that.

01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:04.860
-Great.

01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:06.112
-If you want.

01:39:06.112 --> 01:39:08.320
-I was about to come up with
something, but go ahead.

01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:08.820
-OK, no, no.

01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:11.140
And if you have come up with
something, interrupt me.

01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:12.098
-Yeah, I'll keep that--

01:39:12.098 --> 01:39:13.580
-Completely.

01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:15.920
So one, what we know is
narrative is really powerful.

01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:17.670
And there's going to
be a narrative, which

01:39:17.670 --> 01:39:19.545
is laid on you, which
is probably inaccurate.

01:39:19.545 --> 01:39:22.010
And I love the way Robin
refers to it is irrational,

01:39:22.010 --> 01:39:23.136
because it is.

01:39:23.136 --> 01:39:25.260
So what you have to do is
understand the narrative,

01:39:25.260 --> 01:39:26.160
which is laid on you.

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:29.050
And the narrative is if you have
a child, even if your behaviors

01:39:29.050 --> 01:39:32.410
change in no way, you are
viewed as less committed,

01:39:32.410 --> 01:39:37.920
less engaged, your pathway to
promotion virtually disappears.

01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:40.090
And the guy down the
hall does better.

01:39:40.090 --> 01:39:42.874
But once you know that,
then you know what to do.

01:39:42.874 --> 01:39:44.290
And the way you
inoculate yourself

01:39:44.290 --> 01:39:47.110
from that is when
you're on leave

01:39:47.110 --> 01:39:49.230
you have touch points
with your manager.

01:39:49.230 --> 01:39:52.080
When you return you go in front
of them and you say, I'm here,

01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:54.280
I'm looking, what's my
next stretch assignment,

01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:58.350
which teams am I going to be
on, which programs, projects

01:39:58.350 --> 01:40:00.050
am I running?

01:40:00.050 --> 01:40:01.160
And you define it.

01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:03.490
Now people will presume
whenever they can't see you

01:40:03.490 --> 01:40:04.895
that you're with your child.

01:40:04.895 --> 01:40:07.650
It's bananas, but that's
what they presume.

01:40:07.650 --> 01:40:10.450
So you have to have
a narrative where you

01:40:10.450 --> 01:40:12.980
create an open schedule, right?

01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:14.300
You paste it on your door.

01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:16.690
You tell your colleagues,
I'm going down

01:40:16.690 --> 01:40:20.270
the hall to negotiate a deal.

01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:21.770
You have to be explicit.

01:40:21.770 --> 01:40:24.860
And much of what this work
is when you understand

01:40:24.860 --> 01:40:27.380
the cultural archetype
that's pasted on you,

01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:29.450
you have to do the
work of peeling it off.

01:40:29.450 --> 01:40:31.850
You have to tell
people who you are.

01:40:31.850 --> 01:40:33.640
I'm organizationally committed.

01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:38.020
I love being here till
9 o'clock at night.

01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:39.387
And to do it authentically.

01:40:39.387 --> 01:40:40.720
That's the other thing I'll say.

01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:42.231
This is not a game
of showmanship.

01:40:42.231 --> 01:40:44.480
This is a game of authentically
presenting and letting

01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:45.750
people see you.

01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:47.290
-Robin, do you have
a quick comment?

01:40:47.290 --> 01:40:49.040
-Well, I guess I understood
the question-- maybe,

01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:49.970
maybe I misunderstood.

01:40:49.970 --> 01:40:53.900
I thought you were saying
that as a single woman what--

01:40:53.900 --> 01:40:59.512
and yeah and not necessarily
anticipating that you're

01:40:59.512 --> 01:41:00.720
going to be in that category.

01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:04.182
But right now you
don't have the child.

01:41:04.182 --> 01:41:05.640
You don't have and
yet you're going

01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:08.422
to be perceived as someone who
is going to go down that path.

01:41:08.422 --> 01:41:09.630
So how do you deal with that.

01:41:09.630 --> 01:41:13.900
I mean, in some ways I would say
something similar to Victoria

01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:19.210
said, which is, I think you
got to resist the pressure.

01:41:19.210 --> 01:41:22.130
I mean, be aware that that
is a stereotype that's

01:41:22.130 --> 01:41:24.330
going to be put on you.

01:41:24.330 --> 01:41:29.980
And I think, creating your own
story and telling that story.

01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:35.200
I guess what I would be
concerned about is I see that

01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:37.626
there can be a kind of
a division among women

01:41:37.626 --> 01:41:39.750
in the work place-- between
women who have children

01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:41.280
and women who don't.

01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:44.750
And so I would just
maybe want to say,

01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:47.680
you know women find themselves
in different situations

01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:49.050
for all kinds of reasons.

01:41:49.050 --> 01:41:50.780
Having or not having
children is one.

01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:54.120
Being partnered and partnered in
different ways is another one.

01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:57.160
But I think it's really
important to-- even

01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:00.800
while you're differentiating
yourself and saying,

01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:03.930
this is who I am, these
are my commitments,

01:42:03.930 --> 01:42:06.960
this is what I'm willing
to do-- to not lose

01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:09.790
the connection to women who
are doing something different.

01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:10.350
-Thank you.

01:42:10.350 --> 01:42:12.060
-Nancy.

01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:13.235
-Hi, I'm Nancy Hopkins.

01:42:13.235 --> 01:42:15.890
I'm a retired professor
of biology from MIT.

01:42:15.890 --> 01:42:17.900
And I'd like to thank
the Radcliffe Institute

01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:19.630
for doing this
fantastic symposium,

01:42:19.630 --> 01:42:21.650
the wonderful panelists.

01:42:21.650 --> 01:42:24.610
I was totally depressed to hear
how much money women aren't

01:42:24.610 --> 01:42:27.620
raking in.

01:42:27.620 --> 01:42:29.190
-Me, too.

01:42:29.190 --> 01:42:30.300
-Really sad.

01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:32.650
But I'm even sadder,
actually, about the impact

01:42:32.650 --> 01:42:35.150
this has within the
universities on the women

01:42:35.150 --> 01:42:37.870
who were interested
in biology, including

01:42:37.870 --> 01:42:41.835
having really brilliant young
women literally break down

01:42:41.835 --> 01:42:44.310
in your office and say the
men go off into their office

01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:46.389
with the young men in
their labs and talk

01:42:46.389 --> 01:42:47.930
about the biotech
companies and leave

01:42:47.930 --> 01:42:49.570
the women sitting outside.

01:42:49.570 --> 01:42:52.300
So we've talked about how
the women should change,

01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:54.990
and we've talked about what
the companies might do,

01:42:54.990 --> 01:42:59.080
so I'd like to ask anyone
who's willing to answer it

01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:00.630
what should the universities do?

01:43:00.630 --> 01:43:01.880
What is the responsibility?

01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:04.880
It's not an accident that
this industry has grown up

01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:06.670
around these universities.

01:43:06.670 --> 01:43:07.950
Same for Stanford.

01:43:07.950 --> 01:43:13.840
And so, in a sense, I feel that
there's some responsibility

01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:15.070
there.

01:43:15.070 --> 01:43:17.830
Wonder what you
think about that.

01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:20.780
How they could step in
to fix this problem.

01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:22.760
-I'll just give you
one example that I

01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:25.560
thought was very compelling
that came from Berkeley.

01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:28.160
And Berkeley is not
looking at gender,

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:29.910
but is looking at the
reality that they're

01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:33.150
aren't postdoc positions
and faculty positions.

01:43:33.150 --> 01:43:35.900
And they have started
having symposia

01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:40.640
on campus very frequently for
their postdocs and PhD Students

01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:43.710
to meet industry and
venture capitalist.

01:43:43.710 --> 01:43:46.500
-I think when it comes
to intellectual property,

01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:50.500
each discipline define--
its very fascinating.

01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:53.320
You know what you do as
an engineer the university

01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:54.930
owns forever.

01:43:54.930 --> 01:43:57.980
What you do and
things-- you know,

01:43:57.980 --> 01:44:00.310
like anything having
to do with biomedical,

01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:04.420
it appears that one
can take it with you.

01:44:04.420 --> 01:44:09.540
I don't know enough about how
the OGC manages or does this,

01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:14.519
but my thought is--
what would it take?

01:44:14.519 --> 01:44:15.810
I think we all understand that.

01:44:15.810 --> 01:44:18.680
It would take the
senior tenured faculty

01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:23.890
to put enormous pressure
having-- I'm so aware now

01:44:23.890 --> 01:44:24.890
that we're cameraed.

01:44:24.890 --> 01:44:28.490
You know, conversation
you know thoughtfully,

01:44:28.490 --> 01:44:31.130
with the corporation
about what this looks like

01:44:31.130 --> 01:44:34.410
and what it means, I'm
fascinated by your thought

01:44:34.410 --> 01:44:36.650
about Title IX and Title VII.

01:44:36.650 --> 01:44:41.220
And I think that
is really Title IX

01:44:41.220 --> 01:44:44.994
and Title VII are being looked
at and actioned right now

01:44:44.994 --> 01:44:46.910
in a way they haven't
done before that there's

01:44:46.910 --> 01:44:50.190
all kinds of growing
efficacy there.

01:44:50.190 --> 01:44:53.570
-And do you think that there
should be a regulation applied

01:44:53.570 --> 01:44:54.920
to the space?

01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:57.830
Is that a good way to
deal with the problem?

01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:58.830
-The problem is real.

01:44:58.830 --> 01:45:02.370
-I think I'll make
an observation.

01:45:02.370 --> 01:45:05.420
So someone's got to
take out the license.

01:45:05.420 --> 01:45:08.210
So it's either
the entrepreneur--

01:45:08.210 --> 01:45:10.880
these days in Boston a
lot of the venture firms

01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:12.867
are engaged in the
early stage formation,

01:45:12.867 --> 01:45:14.450
and the venture firms
are the ones who

01:45:14.450 --> 01:45:17.530
take out the license
from the university.

01:45:17.530 --> 01:45:22.420
I wonder what would happen if
the simple question were asked,

01:45:22.420 --> 01:45:26.250
can you describe for me the
composition on the diversity

01:45:26.250 --> 01:45:29.500
basis of your
venture firm or who's

01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:32.850
going to be responsible for
developing whatever you're

01:45:32.850 --> 01:45:34.750
licensing out?

01:45:34.750 --> 01:45:38.480
Because we have
data in we believe

01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:42.130
that you're more
likely to be successful

01:45:42.130 --> 01:45:45.480
if you have a diverse team.

01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:49.440
So I'm not sure about
from a policy standpoint,

01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:52.860
but I think the
venture firms that I

01:45:52.860 --> 01:45:56.935
know in town-- one
of the venture firms,

01:45:56.935 --> 01:45:58.060
actually, on their website.

01:45:58.060 --> 01:45:58.634
It was great.

01:45:58.634 --> 01:46:00.050
I haven't looked
at it in a while,

01:46:00.050 --> 01:46:02.920
because I don't look
at, because I know them.

01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:06.390
And I was surprised to see
that there are a bunch of women

01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:07.240
on the website.

01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:09.120
And I was like what?

01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:11.465
Who are these people?

01:46:11.465 --> 01:46:13.590
I have never encountered
them when I see these guys

01:46:13.590 --> 01:46:16.120
on like multiple times a basis.

01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:18.765
And they had actually
put up all their admins.

01:46:22.410 --> 01:46:24.835
Anyway, sorry
sidebar and perhaps

01:46:24.835 --> 01:46:26.460
I should have turned
off my microphone.

01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:28.755
-That is actually a very
common practice in VC firm--

01:46:28.755 --> 01:46:30.880
-Should have turned off my
microphone for that one,

01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:33.570
but I can't imagine what
would that conversation

01:46:33.570 --> 01:46:37.000
look like even if it wasn't a
policy if the simple question

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:40.960
we're asked, can you tell me
about the diversity of the team

01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:44.440
that's responsible for
making good on the license

01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:45.890
I'm about to give you.

01:46:45.890 --> 01:46:48.380
Because we have
data and we believe

01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:49.960
it's more likely
to be successful

01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:51.850
if you have a diverse group.

01:46:51.850 --> 01:46:54.070
That's where I might just
start the conversation,

01:46:54.070 --> 01:46:58.620
because someone might
just take notice.

01:46:58.620 --> 01:46:59.450
-Thank you, Ann.

01:46:59.450 --> 01:47:00.940
It's good answer.

01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:01.460
-Great.

01:47:01.460 --> 01:47:02.439
Thank you all so much.

01:47:02.439 --> 01:47:03.480
My name's Theresa Nelson.

01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:06.630
I'm a professor in the School
of Management at Simmons College

01:47:06.630 --> 01:47:09.530
and really glad to be here.

01:47:09.530 --> 01:47:12.820
I'm going to sort of
resonate to Ann's point

01:47:12.820 --> 01:47:15.510
about the strength
of biotech in Boston.

01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:19.130
And what an important factor
it is that we are here

01:47:19.130 --> 01:47:22.480
and this is happening right
here as a world standard.

01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:24.500
And also referring to
her comment about the

01:47:24.500 --> 01:47:26.980
get it done, because
there's a group

01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:30.050
of people here across
the ecosystem in academia

01:47:30.050 --> 01:47:33.000
and entrepreneurs and
venture capitalists, who

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:36.250
would like to take some
action around this topic.

01:47:36.250 --> 01:47:39.210
And we've been talking about
it for about two years.

01:47:39.210 --> 01:47:41.240
And what we've
come up with we're

01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:43.900
going to begin to actualize,
I believe, in the spring.

01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:46.730
And would love to get
people's senses of it.

01:47:46.730 --> 01:47:52.320
And it really has to do
with understanding the fact

01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:55.050
that the pipeline as
Nancy said in biology

01:47:55.050 --> 01:47:58.600
and academic medicine,
is so strong with women.

01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:00.420
What an enormous
achievement this

01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:03.260
is compared to 20
and 25 years ago,

01:48:03.260 --> 01:48:05.720
referring to
Victoria's comments.

01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:09.740
And we have been
wondering whether women

01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:13.860
in the early stages of their
PhDs as well as PhD students,

01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:16.990
postdocs, and those in
early science careers

01:48:16.990 --> 01:48:20.420
are really aware of their
career options in terms

01:48:20.420 --> 01:48:23.340
of commercialization; in
terms of the protection

01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:26.740
of their intellectual property;
in terms of licensing.

01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:30.120
Where is the expert in that
for them to reach out to?

01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:32.740
And to really
understand that they

01:48:32.740 --> 01:48:35.530
have choices to make
around commercialization.

01:48:35.530 --> 01:48:38.010
So we're imagining
this has to be

01:48:38.010 --> 01:48:41.190
something that happens
outside of the major teaching

01:48:41.190 --> 01:48:42.750
institutions.

01:48:42.750 --> 01:48:46.870
Perhaps and that this is a way
to really start a question so

01:48:46.870 --> 01:48:50.800
that women in science have
enough of the business

01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:53.510
entrepreneurship side as well.

01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:56.230
And so I just love to get
your thoughts on that.

01:48:59.225 --> 01:49:01.600
-Theresa, are you going to be
around for a glass of wine?

01:49:04.604 --> 01:49:05.450
-OK.

01:49:05.450 --> 01:49:06.630
Thank you for your patience.

01:49:06.630 --> 01:49:08.400
This is the last question.

01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:10.584
Yes, I was acknowledging
you and saying,

01:49:10.584 --> 01:49:11.750
thank you for your patience.

01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:12.249
-OK.

01:49:12.249 --> 01:49:15.660
I'm Cassandra Smith.

01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:18.090
This morning, I
don't remember who

01:49:18.090 --> 01:49:21.950
said it, but alluded
to the fact that women

01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:25.050
have more choices than men.

01:49:25.050 --> 01:49:30.980
But they were referring
to children not to adults.

01:49:30.980 --> 01:49:34.460
And my observation
is actually women

01:49:34.460 --> 01:49:40.140
have a much narrower
cone of acceptability

01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:43.120
in behavior than men.

01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:47.470
And in fact, again,
it's my observations

01:49:47.470 --> 01:49:51.550
that women are-- if they
kind of step out of this--

01:49:51.550 --> 01:49:58.360
are much more subjected to
criticism or corrections.

01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:02.540
And I think that's
what influences women

01:50:02.540 --> 01:50:06.150
from speaking for instance
at faculty meetings

01:50:06.150 --> 01:50:10.120
or at meetings like this.

01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:12.180
So any comments.

01:50:12.180 --> 01:50:15.900
Because the only comments
thus far in the meeting

01:50:15.900 --> 01:50:17.990
were on young children.

01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:22.840
That women, females, girls
have more choices than boys.

01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:25.750
-I think it's actually
true for adults, too.

01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:27.260
But it's a little
bit complicated.

01:50:27.260 --> 01:50:32.170
I think the research suggests
that men will be punished more

01:50:32.170 --> 01:50:34.670
for violating the
masculine stereotype

01:50:34.670 --> 01:50:37.800
and evidencing
feminine behavior.

01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:41.210
And women are punished less.

01:50:41.210 --> 01:50:45.400
They're punished, but it is
more of a violation for men

01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:46.670
to go in that direction.

01:50:46.670 --> 01:50:48.554
So I think that's true
of adults as well.

01:50:48.554 --> 01:50:50.220
I think what you're
probably noticing is

01:50:50.220 --> 01:50:55.510
that the domains within
which women are circumscribed

01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:57.270
are these public ones.

01:50:57.270 --> 01:50:59.720
And so we see it and
that's what we're all here

01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:02.530
being concerned about.

01:51:02.530 --> 01:51:04.940
But I think if you looked
at men's violations

01:51:04.940 --> 01:51:07.680
in the other direction, it's
just doesn't tend to be public.

01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:10.080
And when it is public, it's
pretty severely punished.

01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:13.220
And there's a lot of man
on man sexual harassment

01:51:13.220 --> 01:51:17.161
and violations of
gender roles-- those

01:51:17.161 --> 01:51:18.910
are the people who end
up getting sexually

01:51:18.910 --> 01:51:21.580
harassed, both men and women.

01:51:21.580 --> 01:51:23.600
But I think it's
not just children.

01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:25.020
But that's my--

01:51:25.020 --> 01:51:25.770
-Thank you, Robin.

01:51:25.770 --> 01:51:28.600
We are 15 minutes over
so we really must stop.

01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:29.930
And Janet, please.

01:51:29.930 --> 01:51:30.540
-I'll just--

01:51:30.540 --> 01:51:34.460
-Thank you, let me just thank
the panel and Janet will--

01:51:34.460 --> 01:51:36.020
and thank the
audience, thank you

01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:39.035
audience for hanging
in there for so long.

01:51:39.035 --> 01:51:40.454
And Janet, please.

01:51:40.454 --> 01:51:42.870
-I want to thank you all, thank
the panel, and the earlier

01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:44.040
panel.

01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:46.890
This is an incredibly
interesting day,

01:51:46.890 --> 01:51:48.540
even if you're not in biotech.

01:51:48.540 --> 01:51:51.244
I think you can really
see the biotech leadership

01:51:51.244 --> 01:51:52.160
and the biotech board.

01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:56.250
It's something of a litmus
test where gender relations

01:51:56.250 --> 01:51:57.920
stand in our society.

01:51:57.920 --> 01:52:02.390
This is an industry that
is less than 50 years old.

01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:04.510
And you could argue
that it's leaders

01:52:04.510 --> 01:52:09.420
are of an age where they
should know better than this.

01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:14.040
And yet, it is one of the
biggest, most lavish boys clubs

01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:15.480
we have around.

01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:18.360
So I am glad on many levels
that we've come here together

01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:20.240
to talk about it.

01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:23.180
Today we've highlighted
the bias, the gender bias,

01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:26.210
the irrational, the
implicit bias that

01:52:26.210 --> 01:52:27.950
underlies much of that.

01:52:27.950 --> 01:52:30.500
I'm very grateful for
Allison's data, which

01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:34.430
are profoundly disturbing
is still validating

01:52:34.430 --> 01:52:37.820
because it really reflects what
many of us still do experience.

01:52:37.820 --> 01:52:40.480
We've also talked about
the internal conflicts

01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:42.080
that women highlight and site.

01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:44.770
Family is priority
in that conflict.

01:52:44.770 --> 01:52:48.700
We talked a bit about
pulling way back

01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:51.590
and seeing that not
necessarily as simply

01:52:51.590 --> 01:52:56.420
the choices of individual
women but as systems problems.

01:52:56.420 --> 01:52:59.010
You'll remember the phrase
the personal is political.

01:52:59.010 --> 01:53:01.590
The personal is corporate.

01:53:01.590 --> 01:53:04.429
These are systems
design problems.

01:53:04.429 --> 01:53:06.470
We've also highlighted
some of the behaviors that

01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:09.570
might be necessary
for women success--

01:53:09.570 --> 01:53:12.200
demanding, giving time,
perhaps volunteering,

01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:15.460
tilting your head,
and also the conflict

01:53:15.460 --> 01:53:19.040
between what may be the
behaviors and the affect

01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:22.310
needed for survival versus
that which is ultimately

01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:24.370
needed for success.

01:53:24.370 --> 01:53:29.420
I think this adds up to
the danger of almost a John

01:53:29.420 --> 01:53:30.630
Henryism.

01:53:30.630 --> 01:53:32.640
Those of you who
are sociologists

01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:33.780
will recognize that term.

01:53:33.780 --> 01:53:36.890
It was coined by Sherman
James to describe the attitude

01:53:36.890 --> 01:53:39.150
among some minority
citizens that they

01:53:39.150 --> 01:53:42.690
have to work harder to
get to the same place

01:53:42.690 --> 01:53:44.250
the majority citizens do.

01:53:44.250 --> 01:53:48.910
Even if it comes at a
cost to their health.

01:53:48.910 --> 01:53:51.340
The reference is to
a tail, a folktale

01:53:51.340 --> 01:53:54.850
about an African American
railroad man, a steel driver,

01:53:54.850 --> 01:53:58.610
who vowed that he could beat the
steam engine with his muscles

01:53:58.610 --> 01:54:03.050
and with his hammer to drive
a tunnel through a mountain.

01:54:03.050 --> 01:54:07.070
And he went up against the
steam engine and dammit he won,

01:54:07.070 --> 01:54:10.350
but he died with a
hammer in his hand.

01:54:10.350 --> 01:54:14.150
I would say that the modern
day equivalent is that bad ass

01:54:14.150 --> 01:54:16.502
woman who's working two shifts.

01:54:16.502 --> 01:54:18.210
She's working all day
at the biotech firm

01:54:18.210 --> 01:54:20.660
and she's going home to
work with her family.

01:54:20.660 --> 01:54:22.610
She may get to that
C-suite but she's

01:54:22.610 --> 01:54:24.650
got a briefcase on one
shoulder and a diaper bag

01:54:24.650 --> 01:54:26.040
on the other shoulder.

01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:31.830
It describes the
way it is, but it

01:54:31.830 --> 01:54:35.720
doesn't have to describe
the way it should be.

01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:38.480
I think we've talked
about making changes.

01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:42.820
It isn't just about navigating
the system or fixing the women,

01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:45.140
but really about
changing the system.

01:54:45.140 --> 01:54:48.020
We've talked about really
making clear the value

01:54:48.020 --> 01:54:51.390
proposition of having
women who stay,

01:54:51.390 --> 01:54:53.139
inviting women in
having them stay.

01:54:53.139 --> 01:54:54.680
The burden of proof,
unfortunately, I

01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:56.590
think is on us.

01:54:56.590 --> 01:54:58.450
We're the minority
in the situation,

01:54:58.450 --> 01:55:01.370
we need to make that case,
we need to make it clearly.

01:55:01.370 --> 01:55:03.310
We've talked about
change we must make.

01:55:03.310 --> 01:55:06.650
We've talked about how that is
deep, ongoing, transformational

01:55:06.650 --> 01:55:08.670
work to use Robin's phrase.

01:55:08.670 --> 01:55:11.520
And we need to define what
is actionable change that we

01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:13.240
can demand.

01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:15.560
I'll just finish by
saying at the break I need

01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:18.790
to draft these remarks so I went
out back in the hallway there

01:55:18.790 --> 01:55:21.010
and a young woman
who I couldn't see

01:55:21.010 --> 01:55:22.720
was out there too
clearly calling

01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:25.410
her partner about-- looks
like this conference is

01:55:25.410 --> 01:55:29.170
going to go long, can you
pick Alexandra up at daycare.

01:55:29.170 --> 01:55:31.250
I didn't see you, I don't
know if you're here.

01:55:31.250 --> 01:55:33.174
-That was me.

01:55:33.174 --> 01:55:34.136
-Oh, that was you?

01:55:38.465 --> 01:55:41.170
I was going to say as
I hope whoever you are,

01:55:41.170 --> 01:55:43.190
you're still here,
because we need you.

01:55:43.190 --> 01:55:47.060
We need every one of you,
we need you and your talent.

01:55:47.060 --> 01:55:50.180
So thank you for being here.
