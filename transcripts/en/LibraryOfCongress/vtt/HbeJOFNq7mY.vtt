&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.840


00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.773
&gt;&gt; John Kelly: Welcome everyone.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.776
And if you've -- if
you've been sitting here

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.876
for the last few hours I
guess welcome doesn't apply.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.450
But thank you for -- welcome
to me 'cause I just got here.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.156
My name is John Kelly.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.793
I'm a columnist at the Washington
Post, and I want to thank everybody

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.053
for coming to this, the tenth
annual National Book Festival,

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.260
which the Washington Post
has been delighted to sponsor

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.246
since the very beginning.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.696
We like when people read things,
so thank you for reading things.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.760
I need to tell you, if you
haven't heard it already,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.166
that this is being video taped.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.393
And so if you are in the witness
protection program, or you're trying

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.856
to hide from someone, you
should be aware of that,

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.050
because you may show
up on -- on camera.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.706
Also, when -- when it's time to
ask questions we have microphones

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.750
in the aisles, so you can move to
a microphone to ask your question

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.703
so everybody can hear you.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.436
I'm gonna be introducing
our next speaker and author.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.146
And I should say that Rosemary Wells
has probably done more for rabbits

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.400
than anyone since Beatrix Potter.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.483
Her Max and Ruby books
have entertained children

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.910
since the first one came
out in 1979 I think it was.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.383
She may also be the country's
leading chronicler of noisy mice,

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.923
curious west highland
terriers, and sushi loving cats.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.613
But Rosemary Wells is phenomenally
diverse, with a body of work

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.120
that includes not just books
to be read to children,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.626
but books to be read by them,
and they their older brothers

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.120
and sisters, from Red Moon at
Sharpsburg, a young adult novel

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.630
about the Civil War battle
at Antetum, to My Havana,

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.283
memories of a Cuban boyhood,
a story inspired and written

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.720
with Secundino Fernandez,
a Havana-born architect

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.176
who captivated Wells, as well as
her latest book, On the Blue Comet.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.413
Original, sensitive, incisive,
versatile, wry, these are just some

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.486
of the words used to describe her.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.570
Rosemary once wrote in
the Washington Post,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.870
my childhood is irreplaceable,
and the greatest gift that I own.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.746
Through the more than 120 books she
has written over the last 40 years,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.203
I think that she's given
an immeasurable gift

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.490
to countless other childhoods.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.690
So please welcome Rosemary Wells.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.990
[ applause ]

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.163
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: It's --

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.196
it's really hard for me
to believe any of that.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.396
To me I'm just the --
the mother who used

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.476
to do the late away games
driving for Sacred Heart

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.363
for my kids in soccer and lacrosse.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.223
I used to have to go all
over Westchester County

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.376
to unknown schools and pick up about
seven girls 'cause I was qualified

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.920
to -- to drive a van.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.320
And that's who I really am.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.983
I wanted to in this late afternoon
on this hot, hot beautiful day,

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.846
at this wonderful symposium
give a little thanks out,

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.890
first to the marvelous red-shirted
volunteers who proliferate --

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.543
[ background applause ]

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.943
all over this wonderful fair.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.440


00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.973
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: Thank you.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.830
Thank you for your hard work,
thank you for your courtesy,

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.050
thank you for your love of books
or I know you wouldn't be here.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.916
There's another person who
is not here in this audience,

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.160
I'm quite sure, but I think that she
deserves a little bit of thanks too.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.476
I believe that the greatest legacy

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.426
of the Bush administration
was Laura Bush's festival.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.510
[ applause ]

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.666
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: I had an
interview earlier today with --

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.793
with a couple of wonderful writers
from -- from a magazine that --

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.020
that is basically the magazine that
preschool teachers enjoy and --

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.840
and read and write letters to.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.330
And they asked me if I had -- are
these microphones loud enough?

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.943
Can you all here me?

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.610
Okay. They asked me if I would
say anything about using books

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.540
with kids, and -- and the reason
to do it, and how to do it, and --

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.366
and that kind of a question.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.833
And I wanted to answer it and --

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.146
and hope that there's lots
of teachers in this audience.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.320
Are there teachers in this audience?

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.420
[ applause ]

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.263
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: Bless you.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.663
You are -- you are the most
important professionals

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.603
in American life today.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.570
[ applause ]

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.993
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: In your hands --

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.593
in your hands are our young
people, and our future.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.943
And I do wish you were all
paid as well as lawyers.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:20.510
[ applause ]

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.286
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: We'll get
back to the teachers in a minute,

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.560
because I love teachers, and I
love to advocate for teachers.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.030
And the one terrific thing that I --

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.833
I like about being a writer
is no one can really fire me,

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.253
so I can say whatever I want.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.380
[ laughter ]

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.896
At any rate, I answered these two
lovely young teachers this morning

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.716
by saying, all I ever intend
to do with Max and Ruby,

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.153
or with The Blue Comet, or anything
else I write and illustrate is

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.353
to cause children to open a
book and look at those pages,

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.323
and love what's inside, and to
love the privacy that a book gives.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.440
I always write for the
most intelligent child.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.306
I never dumb anything
down like the TV does.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.750
TV does nothing but
dumb things down.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.503
They write for children so dumb that
those children don't even exist.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.883
I write for the brightest child,

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.483
knowing that that bright child
can live right here in DC,

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.373
that bright child can come from the
South Bronx, or the furthest reaches

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.840
of rural America, I
don't know where,

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.386
but the poorest, poorest areas.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.276
And I know that child is there,
and that's the child I write for.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.983
I want them to open those pages, and
I want them to love what they find.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.900
And not just my books, any books.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.183
I want them to love books.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:54.053
I don't want to write a book about
what you should do or should think

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.513
or should feel, I never do that.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.136
I write -- really, Max
and Ruby is non-fiction.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.360
[ laughter ]

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.293
If you think about it,
if you think about it,

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.870
because it's all real,
it's all my kids.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.213
And -- and -- and universalized.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.226
And -- and I just want children to
-- to have that great joy that I had

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.546
when I was little and I opened --
cracked the pages of a Nancy Drew.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.453
There was no greater joy,
no greater joy in my life

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.073
than one night I remember when
my daughter was about nine --

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:38.166
my daughter Victoria was about nine
years old and I wanted her to go

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.043
to bed, and she had to get
up early, and I was yelling

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.796
at the bottom of the stairs.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:47.113
I said sweetheart, it is long past
time for bed, and I see that crack

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.946
of light under your door.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.933
Nothing happened.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.626
I said five minutes and that's it.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:00.596
Six minutes past and I had
to go up there finally.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.323
And I knocked on the door.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:06.493
I said it is time for bed, you have
a math test tomorrow and you know

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.776
when the bus comes, and you're
not gonna get your sleep,

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:11.603
and you have to eat your breakfast.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:14.923
She looked up startled.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.046
There she was with a
Nancy Drew in her --

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.780
in her lap, and not you
might notice a vampire novel

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:25.950
or a dystopian novel.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.953
She was there with a Nancy Drew,
and she said oh Ma, I'm so sorry.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:37.816
I didn't really hear you, because
nothing in the room existed.

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:43.460
Even I didn't exist, only
what's in this book, I was gone.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:47.790
And the thing -- you
know, you never can --

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:49.656
you never can prevent
what you really think,

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:56.350
and it just goes skipping through
your head without any warning.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.616
And I said okay, I can die now.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.260
[ laughter ]

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.793
Back to those teachers.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:10.016
Critical thinking is what they're
going to get when they love books.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.730
They're not gonna open a
book if they don't love it.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:14.866
They're not gonna open a book
if you whip the book to death

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.833
with questions and all kinds of
things that invades the privacy

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.806
of the reader and the story.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:25.940
[ applause ]

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.766
With all these prepared teacher
questions, it's just terrible.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.446
Children hate them.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.963
They want that book
to be a private thing.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:37.173
Unfortunately, a great many of them
don't have the privacy of reading

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:40.863
by themselves or the privacy
of reading with a parent,

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:45.590
and it's up to the teacher to do it.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:45.786
There are three things that
happen to those children,

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.286
and they are totally important.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.970
One is the art of critical thinking,

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.790
the art of not following
say a politician and voting

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.160
for that politician who
talks in bumper stickers.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:06.510
[ applause ]

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:09.950
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: And talks about
-- and talks -- and talks unfairly,

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.003
and -- and hatefully
to other politicians.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.260
That child is gonna critically think
right around that and say, you know,

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:20.916
I want to hear the other
side of this question,

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.683
I want to hear the
other point of view.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.880
That's what a reader is.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.170
A reader is also someone
who escapes.

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:35.383
The richest children among
us still want to escape.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:37.636
They still want to
escape from something,

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:39.513
no matter what it is,
they want to escape.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.160
And that's what books give us.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.740
And it also gives us a private
scaffold to adventure and knowledge.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.776
And when I -- I use the word
scaffold very, very carefully,

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:58.283
because it's an educationee's word,

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.433
and I don't like educationee's
very much at all.

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:03.976
I speak the English
of my grandmother.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:04.696
I speak the English language of
1943, and I haven't changed a thing.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:08.076
But I will -- I will
use the world scaffold,

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:14.610
because it is the difference
between television and books.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:17.823
Television is not scaffold --

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:21.890
scaffolded to the individual
child -- that child's interests,

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:22.240
that child's reading skills,
that child's abilities.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.853
The child can pick
from hundreds of books,

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:28.786
and find the books
that's right for them.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:34.586
And the books give them a scaffolded
bridge of safety with handrails

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:39.836
to escape, to gain knowledge,
and to simply have fun.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.280
All I can do is make it
fun to open those covers.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.023
And that's what I hope to do.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:53.006
I had the privilege of speaking
a little bit earlier to one

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:54.726
of our most distinguished
guests who's sitting somewhere

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.253
in this audience.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.586
I won't point her out, but she is
the daughter of a great President.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.740


00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:05.250
He was born in Texas.

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:10.170
He would never have made it
to Congress or the first thing

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:10.526
without a tremendous
drive for education,

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.966
without books and libraries.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:19.033
And we're not going to have a
generation of children who are

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.226
of this kind at all, unless
we get them back into books.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:27.716
I worry about our democracy.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:29.350
[ silence ]

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:32.656
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells:
You will excuse me.

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:34.816
I'm a grandmother to four,
and they pick up things in --

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.763
in school that grab
hold of the sinuses

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.600
of the adults that
are just terrible.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.880
So I'm gonna -- I think
I have a little water.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:55.003
We are in danger of losing this
wonderful democracy of ours.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:13:00.076
The one solution and the one thing
that's gonna save it is education

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.480
and books.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:03.980
[ applause ]

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:08.436
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: Because
you can't have a democracy

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:13.236
without an educated population,
and without critical thinkers.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:15.686
It means hard work.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.266
It means not allowing
video games in your home.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:25.580
You can't prevent them, but you
can not allow them in your home.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:29.700
Excuse me.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.500
I'm really sorry, I'm
doing the best I can.

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:36.943
I think that the value of the book,

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.470
and the value of the
educated parent,

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.506
and the participatory
parent cannot be overstated.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.326
It's very interesting.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:53.260
There's a recent This Week Sunday
Morning program, again excuse me.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:56.180


00:13:58.590 --> 00:13:58.736
If anybody's got a cough
drop I would love one.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:02.510
[ silence ]

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.706
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: That's
wonderful, thank you.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.640
Thank you.

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:16.510
[ silence ]

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:31.743
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: A recent Sunday
Morning Christine Amanpour program

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.433
on education had the three
biggies, Arne Duncan,

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:42.180


00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:47.003
Michelle Rhee Welker
[phonetic], and Randi Weingarten.

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:53.303
These are the three big
educational movers and shakers

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.136
in the United States at this time.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:57.370
[ silence ]

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.666
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: They talked about
funding, they talked about unions,

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.080
they talked about teachers, they
talked about Michelle's plan

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:14.670
to reward good teachers, and
basically get rid of the ones

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:19.743
who were not -- thank you
-- who were not up to snuff.

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:22.630
I don't disagree with that.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.206
I think it's a good plan.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:29.740
I do think that the teachers union
has overdone their protection

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:31.150
of teachers, whether good or bad.

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:36.816
And the research will show how
important a good teacher is,

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.896
particularly to a child who
is poor and from the ghetto.

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:42.710
[ applause ]

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:48.253
This couldn't be better stated,
apparently, I haven't said it yet,

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.106
but in the movie Waiting
for Superman,

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:52.610
which is coming to all the theaters.

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:57.276
But I noticed one thing
about the conversation.

00:15:58.950 --> 00:15:59.143
The three biggest educational
movers and shakers

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:05.823
in this country never mentioned
the contribution of parents.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.253
This is critical.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:14.260
The best teacher in the world can't
overcome a parent who simply turns

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:16.696
on the television, or doesn't
read to their children.

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:20.503
This is something --

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:22.670
[ applause ]

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.380
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: This is something
that we need to get out there.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:35.606
And I have to say I've seen a
couple of big changes in my time

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.646
as an American that I never
believed would happen.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.853
Again, excuse me.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.720


00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:45.510
[ silence ]

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:59.676
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: When I was
little we used to have Sunday lunch

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:02.026
at my grandmother's
big house by the sea.

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.200
And the room was always
blue with smoke.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:13.970
And there would be the rattle of
old fashioned glasses with ice.

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:20.060
And we'd sit down to lunch to
roast pork and creamed spinach,

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.270
and other things like that.

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:25.983
And those sweet people
would never have believed

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.400
that you could get Americans going
and running around like rabbits,

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.460


00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.966
that America would -- at least
a lot of us, completely give

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.433
up the drinking and smoking,
or drinking to excess.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:45.650
None of them would have believed it.

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:48.250
We can do this.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:50.426
We can do this in this country.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:52.776
But it's a great unmentionable
to talk

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:57.076
about the parents and
their contribution.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:01.410
And I think we need to be frank,
honest, and come out with this.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:03.323
Again, excuse me.

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:05.690
[ silence ]

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:16.330
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: Two
courses of antibiotics.

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:19.710
[ laughter ]

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.166
Didn't do any good.

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:26.496
30 days, and I'm just
getting over it.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:32.283
So today I brought
you three new books.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.626
I'm going to check the time.

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.953
I'm also going to answer questions.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.086
So very quickly, this
is Max and Ruby.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.200
It's Max and Ruby's Bedtime book.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.173
And it's three stories,
instead of one.

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:52.490


00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:56.723
I had some stories that I wanted
to make into picture books,

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:03.366
and they never really gelled
because they weren't long enough.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.073
Again, excuse me.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.440
[ silence ]

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:17.943
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: They
weren't really long enough.

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:21.610
So I collected them, and
I thought about them,

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.260
and I made them into
shorter stories.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.080


00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.160
And so you'll find them all here.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:34.926
They are Ruby's Restaurant, I know
you can't see it, and I had intended

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:41.063
to have a PowerPoint show.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:47.186
But Ruby's Restaurant is all about
Ruby and Louise, her best friend,

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.276
and how they open a cafe,

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:52.896
with grandma as the one
eater or client, customer.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:01.246
And they forget completely, with
their huge store of rubber food.

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:05.663
Now people ask me how
do my children --

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:10.746
how do my children contribute
to -- to the ideas for books.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.480
Well, I have twin granddaughters,
and they own probably

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:22.616
about 30 different
pieces of rubber food.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:23.790
[ laugher ]

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:25.580
It's wonderful.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000


00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:28.290
[ silence ]

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:36.526
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: They have rubber
hamburgers, they have rubber sushi,

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:42.026
they have rubber lettuce,
rubber milk, rubber butter.

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:42.673
It's just wonderful what they make.

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:48.020
And they make these huge
meals out of this rubber food.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.213
So that's right in this book.

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:54.556
But Ruby and Louise forget
entirely about dessert.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:01.366
So it is left to Max to go
upstairs, and to take the bottle

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:02.900
of baby shampoo, and to
go into the potting shed,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.066
and to mix it with potting
soil, which he does,

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:13.113
and make the most wonderful
chocolate mousse,

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:14.670


00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.673
which he serves to his grandmother.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.300
And of course, she's thrilled.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.546
There's another story in
here about Max rescuing a --

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:30.633
rescuing a dolly of his -- of his
sister's best friend little sister,

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.280
and then another one
about Max goes to school.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:38.650
That is Max.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:43.383
I have two other books that
I would like to bring to you,

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:44.620
because I know I'm
known for picture books,

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.266
but I also am a very
ardent novel writer.

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:54.003
This one again, no
vampires, and no dystopia.

00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:01.136
A very positive and cheerful book
nonetheless, a time travel book

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:06.710
with a big crime in the middle of
it, and set in our depression era

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:12.666
in the 1920s in Cairo [phonetic],
Illinois, Hollywood, and New York.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:15.700


00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.533
I wish I had time to
read you a little of it,

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.106
but my voice is not good enough

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:25.070
to honor the book,
so I'll put it aside.

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:29.010
And then the last one, I think
there are some copies left.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.833
This one is called My Havana.

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:36.610


00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:42.403
About five years ago I was listening
to NPR, and heard the story just

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:47.956
in five minutes of a man
who had left Cuba I think

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:52.323
as a nine-year old
when Castro came in.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.433
And the thing in his
story that stuck with me

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.626
for the next four years was how
much he missed his beautiful city

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:11.516
of Havana, and how much he pined
for it, and how cold and grey

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:18.220
and icy New York was,
where his family had to go.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.400


00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:23.443
So this was in 1958.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:30.180
New York did not necessarily
welcome Hispanics, excuse me.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:33.510
[ silence ]

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:40.570
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: And he
was not a happy camper.

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:45.416
Nonetheless, he built out
of cardboard an entire city

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:51.056
of Havana on his bedroom floor.

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:53.483
It was a miracle.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:56.956
And by spring he'd
made a best friend,

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:57.556
and learned about Coney Island,

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:03.556
and the fact that New York too
could be warm, and had a beach.

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.256
The story stayed with me.

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:10.136
I couldn't find Dino
Fernandez, I had his name wrong.

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:14.463
But I finally did find
him, and wrote his story.

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:18.796
At this point I will
ask for some questions,

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:21.220
and do my best to answer them.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:22.420
Again, forgive me.

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:23.816
I have not been coughing
very much today,

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:27.890
but it's the speaking
that brings it on.

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:31.633
So let's see if anyone
has some questions,

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.413
and I'll do my best to answer them.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:39.510
[ silence ]

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:48.276
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Well: Yes.

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:52.276
&gt;&gt; How did you get the idea
for writing Ruby and Max?

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:52.766
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: Ruby and
Max are my own two children.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.813
And can you believe it?

00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.680
Ruby is 37-years old,

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:01.370
[ laughter ]

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:05.060
mother of three, and
still really bossy.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.180
[ laughter ]

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:12.146
Max is 32-years old and
teaches horticulture at Cornell,

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.333
and is still really dirty.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.600
[ laughter ]

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.600
Thank you.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.100
[ applause ]

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.953
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: Yes.

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.420
&gt;&gt; What inspired you for
the Bunny Cakes book?

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:33.426
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells:
The Bunny Cakes books.

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.226
I can't even tell you.

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:37.820
These books -- they just come to me.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:39.930
Have you ever seen an airport
where the planes are in the air

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:43.680
and you see the lights
of the planes,

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:47.993
and the planes start to land.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.316
There are three, four, or
five, six planes out there.

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:52.270
Well that's how the ideas are.

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:53.670
They come out of the clouds, and
they try to land at my airport.

00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:00.043
Now I have a lot of
books going all the time.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.333
And sometimes they have to
go in a holding pattern.

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:08.763
And then they say you better
let me land or I'll go

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:11.246
down to the Kevin Hankus
[phonetic] Airport.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:14.380
[ laughter ]

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:20.023
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: Thank you.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:24.706
&gt;&gt; I just want to say first thank
you so much for coming and talking

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:27.623
to us today with such great spirit,

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:29.956
even though you're
not feeling too great.

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:31.690
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: I feel just fine.

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:34.490
This is an attack.

00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:35.823
And of course it would
come at the time

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:37.490
where I'm speaking to all of you.

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:40.896
I feel fine, this doesn't hurt,
it just is really annoying.

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:42.923
&gt;&gt; And secondly, I wanted to ask the
title of your new time travel book.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:45.310
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: A title for what?

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:47.006
&gt;&gt; The time travel book that's --
that you brought to show us today?

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:51.680
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells:
On the Blue Comet.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.280
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.813
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: It's about Oscar
Ogleglee [phonetic] who is not --

00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.213
who's 11-years old,
lives in Cairo, Illinois,

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:05.990
and has the most wonderful train
set which he runs with his father.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:08.670


00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.560
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.360
I'd like to know how
long you've been writing,

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.016
what were you doing prior
to, and how did you feel

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:18.310
about the rejections you got when
you first submitted your work?

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:22.430
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: I
was very fortunate.

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:24.193
Excuse me for a minute.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000


00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:27.330
[ silence ]

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:34.236
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: I was very
fortunate in that I worked

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:40.056
for the publisher who
first published me.

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:41.670
&gt;&gt; Wonderful.

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:44.070
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: And I
didn't have any rejections.

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:45.670
&gt;&gt; Wonderful.

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:47.603
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: If
I had them, knowing me,

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:50.470
I would have felt terrible.

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:52.136
But I didn't have any.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:54.003
I learned how to do it
because I was in publishing.

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:56.070
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:00.606
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: You're welcome.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000


00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:00.070
[ silence ]

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:02.070
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: I'm sorry to come
to you with such a terrible cold.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:05.850
Thank you for being
so understanding.

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:08.916
Yes, another question.

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:10.450
Yes?

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:12.906
&gt;&gt; When did you start writing
the Max and Ruby books?

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:18.126
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: When my daughters
were 9-months old and 5-years old,

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.933
and that was about 30 years ago.

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:24.170
Yes?

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:28.530
&gt;&gt; What is your favorite book?

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:30.666
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: What
is my favorite book?

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.280
The ones that I've written?

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:40.370
Right now, On the Blue Comet
and Max and Ruby's Bedtime book.

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:42.180
[ laughter ]

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.360
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.580
&gt;&gt; I do not necessarily
have a question.

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:50.120
I just want to thank you for
bringing such joy to our family.

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:53.766
And I also want to thank
you for your words today,

00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:00.353
recognizing the part a parent
takes in a child's life.

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:02.390
And I hope you get better
soon, God bless you.

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:04.123
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: I
will get better soon.

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:06.390
I'm so terribly sorry,
but as you can imagine,

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:07.720
everybody's here had
a terrible cold,

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:09.573
and you all know what it's like.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:11.653
Again, there are a lot
of people with questions,

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.440
I would like to take them all.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:20.906
I would just like to re-emphasize
the main point of what I came here

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:25.196
to say, which is our parents
need to step up with our kids.

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:27.010
[ applause ]

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:30.410
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: For our teachers.

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:32.010


00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:34.086
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells:
You know, there's a --

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.486
a big scandal about a
Los Angeles Times article

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.480
that rated teachers
publicly from bad to good.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.653
And there was a lot of talk
about whether this fair

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.866
and whether it was right.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.030
And I don't know whether
it was fair or right,

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:57.503
but I don't think you
should rate those teachers

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:00.170
without rating the parents.

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:01.703
I think we should --

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:03.370
[ applause ]

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:05.036
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: I
think we should talk

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:08.740
about how our parent --
whether our parents --

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000


00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:10.436
&gt;&gt; Rosemary Wells: -- are sending
our kids to school prepared.

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:12.970
It's about all I can
say, my time is up.

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.686
I thank you so much for coming.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.120
[ applause ]

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:27.010
[ silence ]

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:36.046
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
