00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's wrap up what we've learned in this unit.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Strings are just sequences of characters,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and manipulating strings is going to be critically important for making a web browser.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Modern programming languages support regular expressions,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
which are just a concise notation for specifying sets of strings,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and using regular expressions is more flexible

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
than using fixed string matching like string.find.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
With regular expressions, we can define phone numbers,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
words, numbers, quoted strings,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and given a regular expression, we can search for and match it in a bigger string.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Finite state machines are a pictorial equivalent to regular expressions.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Every regular expression, concatenation, plus, question mark, star,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
has an equivalent finite state machine.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And in fact, although I didn't show it, vice versa.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Every regular expression has a finite state machine,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and every finite state machine has a regular expression.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And then every finite state machine can be converted

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to a deterministic finite state machine.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
No epsilons, no ambiguity.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Once we have a deterministic finite state machine,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
we can simulate it, and it turns out it's very easy--

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
about 10 lines of recursive code--to see if a deterministic

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
finite state machine accepts a string.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
In fact, you've written that code.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Now that you know how to implement regular expressions,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
take the regular expression, make a finite state machine,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
make it deterministic, call FSM sim.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We'll just use Python's regular expression library,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
but it's doing exactly those steps under the hood.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It works the same way you would.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
In our next exciting episode, we're going to use this knowledge

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
to specify important parts of HTML and JavaScript

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
like string constants or hypertext tags.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
As the first step to writing our web browser,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
one great resource available to you as you revise this material

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and work on the homework is the forums.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Be sure to check them out.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
If you were wondering about something, almost certainly someone else

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
was wondering as well.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Post your question. Others will benefit from seeing it answered.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Be courteous, but be curious.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
We all benefit from questions.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And let me just leave you with this xkcd comic.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
While they're talking about Pearl, everything said applies to Python,

00:02:05.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and soon you will be using regular expressions to save the world.
