00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.000
Throughout history,

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.900
secret compartments
have been found in anything,

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.000
from desks, to chairs, to lamps.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.880
In this video, we'll show you
how to add a concealed compartment

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.400
in the bottom of a dresser drawer.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.700
[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]
[Music]

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.080
[Music]

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.160
To get started on this build,

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.775
we're going to need a dresser,
a desk, or an end table

00:00:18.775 --> 00:00:21.560
that has a drawer that you want
to add a secret compartment to.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.940
Next, you'll need a thin board

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.920
that you can build
the bottom of the drawer out of.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.640
Next, you'll want
a small scrap of wood

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.800
to create the supports
for the false bottom.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.030
We'll also need
a little bit of wood glue

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.740
to attach our support pieces.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.860
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:35.089
We'll cut a thin board
into the same size and shape

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:37.120
as the original bottom of the drawer.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.219
We'll have supports
in each of the four corners

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.040
that will hold our false bottom off
of the original bottom of the drawer.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.659
A hole drilled from beneath
will allow us to use a pen,

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:47.739
a nail, or a piece of a dowel,

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.640
as a secret key
to lift the false bottom up.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.289
In addition, we'll have
a magnetically activated lock

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:55.979
that will prevent anyone
from lifting up the false bottom,

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:57.940
unless they know
the secret to opening it.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.289
The first step is
to choose which drawer

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:00.799
you want to add
your false bottom to,

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:02.370
and remove it from
the rest of your furniture.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.220
This nightstand only
has a single drawer,

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.360
so it's an easy choice.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.400
[Music]

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.330
After removing the
drawer from our furniture,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.340
we need to measure how big
the interior of the drawer is.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.940
We'll cut a piece
that size out of our board.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.660
If you have multiple drawers,

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.660
it might be a good idea

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.180
to try and match
the look of the false bottom

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.760
to the bottoms that
are already in there,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.140
so it doesn't stand out.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.040
In this case, the material
for the false bottom

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.930
isn't quite the same as the material
 that's already in the drawer,

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.660
but since there's only one drawer,
there's nothing to compare it to.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:41.600
[Music]

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.140
The board is now cut
almost to the right size.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.780
But it doesn't quite fit in.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.200
The amount we need to take down
the width of this board is very minor,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.060
so we'll try putting
the gate of the table-saw

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.390
right up against the blade,

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.780
and see if we can trim off
just the tiniest bit of this board.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.660
[Music]

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.380
Our board is now basically cut to size.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.080
And we can start testing
to see if it fits into our drawer.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.300
But before we do that,
we want to add a keyhole.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.420
The key to opening
the false bottom of the drawer

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.350
will be a small hole
in the original bottom.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.920
We'll use a small dowel, a pen,
or a nail to pop a secret bottom off.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.180
Now that we'll be able
to get the false bottom out,

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.680
let's test if it fits.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.700
[Music]

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.260
It looks like we're really close,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.380
but it doesn't quite lay all the way down.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.460
And even though we're going
to have it raised up a bit more,

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.960
we want to shave off
some of the excess material

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.080
so it fits a little
bit more flush than this.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.720
Looking at the front of the drawer,

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.020
we can see that there are
some slight gaps in some places,

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.290
and other places where it's
completely flush with the wood.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.780
The spots where
it's completely flush

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.420
is where it's pressing
maybe a little bit too hard.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.460
Let's mark those with a pencil,

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.760
and then take them
down using a belt sander.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.520
[Music]

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.140
Once you've cut and sanded the board,

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.980
that will be your false bottom,
so it fits perfectly into your drawer,

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.430
it's time to cut some supports
that will keep it lifted off

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.160
of the actual bottom of the drawer.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.620
This is where our little
scrap of wood comes in.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.860
I like the thickness of this
scrap of wood for the total elevation.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.100
If you wanted anything
more than that of course,

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.080
you can just cut farther,
and turn the pieces sideways.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.900
To be able to cut all four pieces
that I'm going to need off

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.130
of this block just the same size,

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.580
I'm going to clamp this
board in place on to the saw.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.160
That will make it so that as I cut,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.380
every piece is cut off the same width.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.000
[Music]

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.400
Before we glue these in place,

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.630
let's do a final test fit
with all four of these in the corners

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.780
and our new false
bottom on top of them.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:51.680
[Music]

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.860
Our false bottom fits,

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.590
but the nail that
I was using to pop it out

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.630
is too short compared to this drawer.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.340
So I'm gonna move to
using this piece of dowel.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.819
This is long enough that we should
be able to pop the false bottom

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.960
all the way up and out of the drawer.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.120
So let's just widen our hole
a little bit to fit this size dowel.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.920
[Music]

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.379
With our board fit to size,

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.080
we can now glue the four supports
into the four corners of our drawer.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:24.660
[Music]

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.040
We can now fit our
false bottom into our drawer.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.900
And we can remove it whenever we want.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.699
But for an added layer of security,

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.889
I want to try and add a hidden lock
to the inside of our secret compartment.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.580
For this lock, we'll use
a small hinge, some powerful magnets,

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.990
a piece of a kitchen sponge,

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.520
and a piece of dowel that can fit
through the screw holes on the hinge.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.880
We've also got some super glue
and some two part epoxy.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.980
Let's use some epoxy
to glue our hinge down

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.990
on to the bottom of our board.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.400
So that the piece that hangs down
is just about flush with the edge.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.320
This kind of two-part epoxy is one
that bonds especially well to metal.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.580
To help make sure it sticks,

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.100
I'm also using a little bit of sandpaper
to rough up the backside of the hinge.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:14.900
[Music]

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.380
With the hinge secured in place,

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.370
we now want to use the same epoxy
to attach one of our strong magnets

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.140
to the other side of the hinge.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.920
The hinge pin is not made
of the same stainless steel

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.160
as the rest of the hinge.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.960
And our magnet is more attracted to it.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.540
If we try and set the magnet right here,

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.420
it gets drawn into the hinge pin.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.380
To keep our magnet where we want it,

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.800
we'll apply the epoxy,

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.120
and then use this small scrap
of cardboard just to keep it in place.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.240
Our hinge now has the
magnet attached to it.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.120
And we don't want
this hinge to fall closed,

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.020
except when we dictate.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.520
So to keep it open until we're ready,

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.380
we're gonna use
a small piece of sponge

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.880
as a sort of compression spring.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.480
We'll have a small piece of this dowel
attached to the front of the drawer.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.700
When the hinge hangs down,

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.720
the hole will fit over
the end of the dowel,

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.360
creating a latch to make it so our
false bottom can't be lifted up.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.920
However, using a magnet,
we'll be able to pull on the hinge,

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.980
and it will move out of the way
so it's no longer attached to the dowel.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.700
To mark where we want to put the dowel,

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.400
we'll apply a tiny bit of paint
to the outside of the circle on the hinge.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.380
We'll then use our magnets
to hold it in place

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.800
as we lower the false
bottom into the drawer.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.580
At that point,
if we remove the magnets,

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.010
the hinge should fall down.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.640
And if we turn our magnet around,

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.800
we can even push it
slightly up against the drawer.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.840
This little spot right here
is what was marked by our paint.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.680
And then it did drag a little bit

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.780
on the side of the
drawer as we lift it up,

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.139
so there's a little bit
of a white line going up.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.180
We need to drill a hole
the same size as our dowel

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.460
right in this spot.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.940
[Music]

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.370
Our dowel fits into place.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.470
And of course, we don't
want a very long piece.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.820
We want a piece
that just barely sticks out

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.300
far enough for
the hinge to grab on to.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.780
After we cut the
dowel at this length,

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.600
we'll also taper
the edge a little bit

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.520
so it's easier for
the hinge to fit around it.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.460
Okay.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.840
About half of one cut
with our hacksaw was enough.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:29.220
[Music]

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.210
The false bottom is built,

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.240
and our drawer is ready
to go back in the nightstand.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:08:03.380
[Music]

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.460
Guys, that's not all.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.710
We've got more for you to see.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.990
That little box up at the top
will transport you directly

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.800
to our last video
in case you missed it.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.780
That box at the bottom
will show you what YouTube thinks

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:12.780
you should be watching next.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.380
And if you hit this
bomb here in the middle,

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.260
you'll be subscribed to our channel
so you never miss another video.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.460
Don't forget to ring that bell.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.480
And we will see you in the next one.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.460
Talk to you then.
