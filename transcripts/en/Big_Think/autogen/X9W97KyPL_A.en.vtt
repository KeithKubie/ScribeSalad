I've been a little disturbed about a

I've been a little disturbed about a
 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.330
I've been a little disturbed about a
wave of cynicism that seemed to emerge

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:07.340
wave of cynicism that seemed to emerge
 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.500

announcement of a draft sequence of the

announcement of a draft sequence of the
 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.480

who claimed that that draft sequence was

who claimed that that draft sequence was
 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.269
who claimed that that draft sequence was
going to result in a complete

have said those things and I certainly

it is utterly different now because of
 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:05.289
it is utterly different now because of
the availability of that sequence and

the availability of that sequence and
 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.210

I tried to sit down in a brief period

I tried to sit down in a brief period
