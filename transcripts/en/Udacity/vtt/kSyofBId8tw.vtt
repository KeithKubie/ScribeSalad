00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.220
We know that with HTTP,

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.730
there are various types of requests
that we can send along with URL.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.850
By default a route in Flask
only answers to get requests.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.970
But that can be changed by providing
the methods argument inside

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:11.810
the route decorator.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.480
I will change my route to
create a new menu item.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.000
Such as a response to GET and
POST requests like so.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.830
Now that I can respond to POST requests,
I can make forms for creating and

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.290
updating menu items.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.100
I will make a new template
called newMenuItem.html like so.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.040
Take a second to look over the code.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.290
Here, I'm making a small form with
only one entry to create a new

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.780
menu item name.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.990
In order to get data from a form,
I will input requests from my

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.300
Flask package like so,
inside my project.py file.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.940
Inside my new menu item function, I will
create an if statement that looks for

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.030
a POST request.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.000
I can create a new menu item like so.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.640
And extract the name field from
my form using the request.form.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.840
After I create the menu item,
I can then add it to my session and

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.520
commit the session to the database.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.510
To redirect the user back to the main
user page I can use a helper

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.920
function called redirect like so.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.745
I should remember to import redirect,
and

00:01:01.745 --> 00:01:05.150
url_for, in order to enable this
functionality in my project.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.820
Now, I need to properly handle the get
request, for creating a new menu item.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.680
If my server didn't receive a POST
request, it's going to go ahead and

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.480
render the template, for
the new HTML template that I created,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.740
to create a new menu item,
passing in the restaurant_id as well.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.030
Now when I click create new item it
takes me to the New Menu Item page and

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.490
I have successfully
created a new menu item
