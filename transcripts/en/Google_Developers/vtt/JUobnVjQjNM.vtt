ADAM DAWES: Hi, everybody.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.670
I'm Adam Dawes.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.820
I'm a product manager at Google
on the Identity team.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.620
TIM BRAY: And I'm Tim Bray.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.330
I'm a developer advocate on the
Identity team at Google.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.170
And we're in the business of
trying to get people to--

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.040
ADAM DAWES: Get out of the
password business.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.630
TIM BRAY: And so recently I
wrote a blog piece about why I

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.960
thought that was a good idea
and people should get into

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.280
Federated login.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.950
And apparently I didn't quite
convince 100% of the people

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:38.460
who read it.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.600
ADAM DAWES: No?

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.490
TIM BRAY: Yeah, there were
some comments which--

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.400
well, let me try and represent
the feeling I got from some of

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.410
those comments.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.780
So I have my tin foil
hat here, and it was

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.530
kind of like this.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.930
You want to capture all my
information, so you give it to

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.020
life insurance salesman and
credit check agencies, and

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.470
then you're going to shovel all
the data over the wall to

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.050
the NSA so I can never buy a
pressure cooker again in my

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.300
life without having a full body
cavity search every time

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.450
I take a book out
of the library.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.120
Are you crazy?

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.090
ADAM DAWES: Tim, settle down.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.610
Settle down.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.170
Take the tin foil
hat off, please.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.790
We can talk about
this rationally.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.750
Now people do get a little bit
exercised about a lot of these

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.100
issues, which is a
very good thing.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.040
I mean, these are issues
that matter.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.470
And there are concerns that
people should examine as they

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.360
look at Federated identity.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.370
But I think the important thing
to think about is, that

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.370
when you go and you're logging
in throughout the internet,

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.820
you're going to be relaying
some amount of information

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.510
about yourself.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.830
You can do it sometimes in a
pseudonymous way, but you're

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:39.720
out there in the world.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.860
You're interacting with other
sites, other businesses, and

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.970
they have a legitimate right
to want to know something

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.580
about you, to make their
services better or fulfill

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.640
their own requirements.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.210
So I think we need
to make sure that

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.580
we're held to standards.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.120
That we do what users think we
should be doing as far as

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.390
their privacy goes.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.950
And the alternatives are, of
the current system, are

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.670
generally a lot worse.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.350
TIM BRAY: So on balance you
think that whereas the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.480
concerns are real, we probably
come out ahead.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.400
ADAM DAWES: Yeah, I think the
security of the system today

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.350
is actually pretty abysmal.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.260
You could argue, some people
think that the privacy

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.190
features are better, but I think
when you dig into the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.630
details they're not actually.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.580
There's not a whole lot
of savings there.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.470
TIM BRAY: Fair enough.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.780
Now if you actually dive deep on
all the different technical

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.360
concerns people raised, which
we'll do some in a minute, and

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.080
there's a lot of them--

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.640
I thought there was sort of
a subtext, which was,

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.910
we don't trust you.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.580
And in general, people don't
trust people who

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.100
are identity providers.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.900
And let's be honest, people seem
to generally not trust

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.140
Google and Facebook.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.060
So how can we address that?

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.220
ADAM DAWES: Well, we're
big companies.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.660
We're in the business of having
a lot of information.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.860
So skepticism, I think,
is warranted.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.700
But again the question is, you
have to trust somebody.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.170
As you go out and you do
business out on the internet

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.240
or out in the world, you have to
relay certain parts of your

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.060
identity and your self in
certain circumstances.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.300
So you're going to have to trust
people with some public

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.240
facing pieces of information.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.290
The question is, how much
control do you have?

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.580
How much visibility do you
have in what's going on?

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.400
And I think we work hard to
try to be very clear and

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.630
transparent with our privacy
policy about exactly what

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.720
we're doing with your
information.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.340
And at the end of the day, we're
really trying to build

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.980
great user experiences--

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.410
not just on Google products,
but really to make the

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.890
internet more and more
useful to people.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.100
Google's business improves as
people use the internet more.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.530
So that's one of the goals of
our team is really to try to

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.140
make it easier to go out
and do what you want

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.480
to do on the internet.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.360
TIM BRAY: I think one good way
to improve trust is just to

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.730
improve competition, have more
of an open ecosystem.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.040
And I note that as of yesterday,
Wordpress is an

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.870
identity provider.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.490
So I think that's nothing
but good to have

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.480
more people in it.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.420
So look, we could spend the rest
of our time here talking

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.460
about what we think you ought
to care about, but I noticed

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.890
that on the Google Moderator
for this thing, a bunch of

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.079
pretty decent questions
popped up.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.550
So rather than do that, why
don't we talk about the things

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.480
that you actually have said
you're interested in?

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.210
So the first one was, oh, OK, if
it's important that users,

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.580
this is Bryant in Seattle.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.080
By the way, hey Bryant,
good to meet you.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.200
I noticed you put a lot
of questions on

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.900
our Moderator here.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.390
If it's important that users
be able to choose their

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.160
identity provider, why is it
that large service providers

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.100
like Google don't accept
Federated login?

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.950
Why can't I login to Google with
open ID connections from

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:46.690
my own domain.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.940
So Adam, you want
to take that?

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.450
ADAM DAWES: Actually
Google does do

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.360
Federated identity today.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.260
All of our Google Apps customers
have the ability to

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.910
configure via SAML their
own identity provider.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.990
So typically that's some sort
of Active Directory kind of

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.840
endpoint that will do the
authentication for the users,

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.880
and Google becomes a relying
party to that.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.990
So we do support Federated
identity.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.680
In some cases, why don't we
allow Federated identity to

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.270
any random identity provider?

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:32.340
Well, just as I said, you
have to trust somebody.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.470
That doesn't necessarily mean
you have to trust everybody.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.970
And there are repercussions with
allowing anybody to get

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.950
into Google's infrastructure
and log in to an account.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:51.260
So we see a tremendous amount
of attempts to abuse Google

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.070
infrastructure.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:06:01.140
So the basic example would be,
if we allowed anybody to use

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.470
whatever identity provider they
wanted, and that identity

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.200
provider was not very secure,
and was easily hacked, and

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.410
people could compromise those
Google accounts by logging in

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.240
via that identity provider, then
a whole bunch of Google

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.750
resources become available.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.620
We're not protecting, we're not
the gatekeeper for those

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.000
Google resources once we trust
an identity provider, a random

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.160
identity provider.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.720
TIM BRAY: In fact, the original
idea, back in the

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.850
original Open ID proposal, was
that everybody should be able

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.760
to nominate their own
identity provider.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.560
And I just have never been
convinced that's going to fly.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.600
My feeling is we are probably
going to be living in a world

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.420
of whitelisted identity
providers, one way or another.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.490
I mean, the notion of us maybe
relying on Facebook doesn't

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:47.660
seem insane to me at all.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.320
The notion of us relying on
whatever identity provider

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.760
they point to in the world,
ugh, that one

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.550
gives me some heartburn.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.700
ADAM DAWES: Those accounts
would have to be severely

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.020
restricted in terms of
what they could do.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.580
TIM BRAY: OK, should an identity
provider be able to

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.820
give relying parties not just
access to information but

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.370
policy on retention
and controls?

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.370
Why can't I give access to my
email address for a month?

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.910
So, that idea doesn't
sound insane to me.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.370
But as far as I know,
we don't do that.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:20.870
ADAM DAWES: So we actually,
our terms of service for

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.610
Google+, actually
allow people--

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:35.370
when you disconnect from a
relying party, the Google+

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:40.860
Developers terms of service
mandate that the identity

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.500
provider actually delete all
the data, except for a very

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.855
small portion of kind of core
profile information.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.780
Having a lot of information
come from the identity

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:01.380
provider is one thing, but when
you're actually using an

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.690
identity provider, you're still
creating an account on

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:05.040
that relying party.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.360
And just because you stop using
that identity provider

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.050
doesn't mean that account
goes away.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:14.440
So the relying party still needs
a few core pieces of

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:20.160
information, like email address,
to be able to service

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.980
you if you want to stop using
that identity provider but not

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.020
stop using that relying party.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.500
TIM BRAY: Having said that,
in the basic low level--

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.789
bottom-level OAuth 2.0
protocols, there unfortunately

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:34.169
is not time retention.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:35.970
When you give somebody
somebody's email address, you

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.200
just give it to them.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.490
And I suspect, in most cases,
they would retain it forever.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.480
So that's actually not something
that I've seen come

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.880
up in the standards
groups and so on.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.130
But it doesn't sound like a
crazy idea to me, so maybe we

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.550
should be thinking about it.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.230
ADAM DAWES: OK, next one.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:53.630
Can I bribe you to give
Persona a spin, Tim?

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:54.860
TIM BRAY: Well, OK.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.940
Just on the subject of bribing
me, go for it.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.440
I'm down with that.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.280
But on Persona-- so I actually
have been looking at Persona

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.620
and started diving into it
deeply, actually, last night.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:12.020
And so far, I've got to say
Persona looks about OK to me.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.980
I haven't so far run across
anything about it that's

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.370
irritating.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.900
A couple of low-level
API characteristic

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.125
glitches, but you know.

00:09:23.125 --> 00:09:25.890
So after I've gone and done
that, you don't even have to

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:26.560
bribe me for this.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.250
I will write about
it at length.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.090
ADAM DAWES: Yeah, I
think Persona is

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:32.720
an interesting project.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.460
Definitely wish them well.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.240
I think the browser ID stuff
is pretty interesting.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.790
That has some really nice
privacy features.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:45.020
The Persona service itself, I
think probably the coolest

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.730
part about that is just the
privacy policy that goes,

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:48.920
that's attached to it.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.740
They have a nice story there.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.440
AUDIENCE: So speaking of which,
Tim, there was one

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.180
question on YouTube.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.690
First of all, I think HR and
legal immediately contacted me

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:59.245
to say no, you cannot
accept bribes.

00:09:59.245 --> 00:10:01.630
And it's in violation of
Google's terms of service of

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.120
you as a current employee.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.240
But the follow on, we
got a question from

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.070
KickYouInTheThroat
over on YouTube.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:11.020
And he says, I'm not
wearing a foil hat.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.940
I'm just concerned
about the policy.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.780
So what we want to do is kind
of address some of those

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.590
people who aren't possibly
wearing the foil hats but are

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.520
concerned about the
current direction.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:20.920
TIM BRAY: Right.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.870
And, you know, comedy term
was irresistible.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.030
How many times do you get a
chance to wear a tin foil hat?

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.890
And I probably got in aggregate
between Google+, and

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:35.470
my blog comments, and Twitter,
oh, 200 or 300 feedbacks of

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:38.020
one flavor another on
the thing I wrote.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.780
Of which, there were a few that
were pretty well, you

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.390
know, ooh, evil corporations.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.420
But I thought actually the vast
majority of them were

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.210
pretty sensible.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.920
And that's why we're
doing this.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.050
And that's why we're doing
an ongoing series on

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:52.240
my blog and so on.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.360
So pardon the tin foil
hat theater.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.050
I wasn't actually talking
about you.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.460
ADAM DAWES: I thought the series
that Tim opened up on

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.540
his blog was really
eye opening.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.790
We do this every day for a
living, and so we can get

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.170
sometimes a little bit
in the bubble.

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:11.110
And opening up this dialogue has
been really great for us

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.090
to really understand
how passionately

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.210
people feel about this.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:17.790
And we're going to work to try
to a, be more transparent

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.790
about it and see what
we can do to

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:21.800
lessen people's concerns.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.095
TIM BRAY: And one of the
interesting things is that we

00:11:25.095 --> 00:11:27.380
know, we have data that shows,
there's a certain number of

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.190
people when they show up to a
website and it asks them to

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.125
create an account and a password
and sign in, they

00:11:31.125 --> 00:11:33.450
just hit Command-W, make
the window go way.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:34.270
I'm not doing that.

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:35.790
I've had enough passwords,
no more.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:39.020
So there were a few people who
wrote back in the dialogue

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.200
online saying, well, when they
see a sign in with Facebook,

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.700
sign in with Google sign,
they hit Command-W,

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:43.620
make the tab go away.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.360
They don't want to deal with
that, which kind of puts all

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.520
the people out there building
websites in a tough position.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.870
Which of those factions is
bigger, and how are they going

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:54.100
to survive in a world with both
those factions in it?

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.230
ADAM DAWES: I think one thing
about Federated identity--

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:00.330
the Facebook Connect
technology's been so

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:00.950
successful.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:05.535
It's so broadly used throughout
the internet that

00:12:05.535 --> 00:12:09.210
that's sort of synonymous
with Federated login.

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:15.170
And Facebook Connect, for the
most part, does mean a fairly

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:18.360
significant exchange of
information about the user to

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.690
the relying party.

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.860
And it's very clear to us
that that is distasteful

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:24.830
for a lot of people.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.340
They don't want to share
all their friends, give

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.940
permissions to be able to write
to their stream, all of

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:34.420
these sorts of things which are
fairly serious privileges.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.810
But Federated identity
doesn't have to be

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.380
that broad in scope.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.260
It can be extremely narrow.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.580
Persona has taken a very narrow
approach with only

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.120
communicating your
email address.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.840
So there is a middle ground,
and we're also working to

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:55.370
support very basic levels of
Federation where very small

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.470
amounts of information are
transmitted, and have that be

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:02.010
a completely seamless experience
to the user.

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:02.720
TIM BRAY: And at the end of
the day, let's not dis

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.390
Facebook too much, either.

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:05.160
Because a lot of people
like what they do.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.270
In many cases, social login
is totally appropriate.

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:10.140
ADAM DAWES: Yeah, for many apps,
the apps are not very

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:13.200
useful if you don't have their
friend list, if you don't have

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.060
the capacity to write
to their stream.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:18.020
I mean they're just not very
good apps, without having that

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.500
basic level of functionality.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.980
But it's not for all sites
and all users.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:24.790
TIM BRAY: OK, time's
moving on.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:25.590
Let's move on here.

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:29.950
OK, should Google and other IDPs
make a clear declaration

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.270
of what they will do with the
information that you've signed

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:32.880
into an app?

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.470
Apps must declare which
of your information

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:35.300
they wish to access.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:39.040
Should the IDP be required
to state what they'll do?

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.170
ADAM DAWES: So yes, at a basic
level we should do this.

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:46.800
We have a privacy policy and we
do explain in our privacy

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.410
policy generally what we do
with your information.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.820
And probably the most important
feature is we don't

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:56.100
share it with others without
your permission to do so.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.790
All the Federation flows
actually have in it a consent

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:04.160
screen which says, we're about
to give information about you

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.300
to somebody else.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.980
Are you good with that?

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:10.650
So that is a core essential
principle of

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.060
everything that we do.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.920
Now what we do internally, a lot
of the questions sort of

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.130
had concerns about what we
do internally with the

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:23.310
information that we learn
about via Federation.

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:27.940
And I think this has been a good
takeaway for me, that we

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.240
need to try to be a little bit
more transparent with what

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.170
we're doing.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.900
I think the reality is, today
we're not really actually

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.490
doing anything with
this information.

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:41.030
It's sitting in a log file
someplace and then gets erase

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.420
after a certain period
of time.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:47.030
But there is a lot of work going
within Google to try to

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.550
understand more about
our users.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:52.450
We have a very strong conviction
that the more we

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:55.270
understand our users,
the better we can

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.610
provide services to them.

00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:01.300
So things like Google Now are
predicated on having a fairly

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.480
rich understanding of the
interests, the activities,

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.620
what users are up to.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:07.500
TIM BRAY: Let's just take
the focus away from

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:08.300
Google for a second.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.100
I think the only sane answer
to that question is, yes.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.040
Whenever you provide information
to somebody, in

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.300
this case the information about
who you're signing into.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.720
It has to be clear what's
happening with that.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.710
So at the moment we've got the
privacy policy which doesn't

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:23.290
say anything specific about
this particular class of

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:24.290
information.

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.110
Maybe it should, maybe it's
good enough as it sits.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:28.540
We'll have to work our
way through that.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.130
ADAM DAWES: OK, next one.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:35.100
Shouldn't IDP always allow
users to refuse access to

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.790
requested information?

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:40.150
This could lead to a broken
experience if the relying

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:44.750
party isn't expecting missing
information, but after a while

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:46.340
RPs will just learn
to deal with that.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.720
So I think, to sum this up I
think this is, on that consent

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:54.110
screen, is their ability to say,
no I don't want to share

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:56.420
my email address or this
piece or that piece?

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.200
TIM BRAY: Actually, it's
all over the map.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.890
If you go and look at the
different consent screens from

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:02.650
different parties, for different
classes of access,

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:04.950
some of them, in particular
Google+ is a

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:06.970
good advantaged example.

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:08.160
It gives you very fine
grained control.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.840
Yeah, they can see, these people
or not those people, or

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:10.790
they can't see any people.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:12.210
And they can do this,
but not that.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:14.820
And yeah, as the questioner
says, the RP has to be

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.080
prepared to deal with that.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.570
Others, it's basically just--
including some of ours, to be

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.240
honest, it's just a yes or no.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.330
Yeah, they want your email
and your basic

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.170
profile, is that OK?

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:23.770
Yes or no?

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:27.140
And we don't provide
fine-grained control.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.140
ADAM DAWES: So this is actually
something that's a

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.650
hot topic with us these days.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:36.340
I think the questioner makes a
good point that the relying

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.440
party, they ask for a certain
body of information.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.740
And if they don't get it they
don't know necessarily what to

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.420
do with that user.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.090
On the other side some
functionality might be

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:51.520
predicated on having access to
certain information, and so it

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.650
makes for a lot more
complicated in app.

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:57.370
What we're thinking about right
now is to have more of

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.350
an incremental way
to deal with it.

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:03.080
So an app can ask for very
little at the very beginning,

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.829
and then as you march through
the app and interact with

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:08.329
different pieces of
functionality in the app, to

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:11.940
ask for those additional
privileges just in time.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:16.890
So the context is clear, and the
user kind of sees what the

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:19.970
quid pro quo is for giving
access to that information.

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:20.814
TIM BRAY: It's horribly
complicated.

00:17:20.814 --> 00:17:23.800
The user experience, people give
us no end of grief when

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.980
we want to be pestering user's
all the time for this

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.240
permission, that permission.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.440
Also, there's the unfortunate
fact that if you look at the

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.480
statistics, there's a
substantial proportion of

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.380
people that just click OK
whenever you put something in

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:33.750
front of them.

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:35.260
And don't even think about it.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.370
And every time you make the
dialogue more complex and

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:42.140
subtle, the proportion that
just click OK goes up.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.800
Because they don't want to take
time to be reading that.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:48.030
So we want to not pester
people excessively,

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:50.460
particularly if that's going to
decrease the security, but

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.890
on the other hand you
would like to offer

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:52.840
more fine-grain privilege.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.200
No, I don't know what the answer
is, but it's something

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.220
we got to keep working on.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.640
ADAM DAWES: Yeah, I always find
this the great conundrum

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.350
of this job, is on that consent
page I'm not sure if

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:04.490
it's better for the consent
rate to go up or

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:06.890
for it to go down.

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:08.290
TIM BRAY: OK, so this
one's easy.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:09.610
And we're running out of
time, so I want to take

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:10.560
a couple more here.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.440
Is there any way to
retroactively revoke just some

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.120
of permissions I've given
away by Federating?

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.840
Like if I log in with Google+
in an app, can I keep

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.680
authenticating and let them see
my email but revoke post

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.210
to my Circles?

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:20.890
And the answer is--

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:23.270
ADAM DAWES: Yes.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:27.390
For that one in particular,
not all constellations of

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:30.760
privileges can be individually
managed that way, but with

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:34.480
respect to Google+, Circles,
and posting,

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.035
that you can control.

00:18:36.035 --> 00:18:38.180
TIM BRAY: What can an ordinary
web user do to decrease their

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.660
exposure when their
identity provider

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:40.630
collaborates with the NSA?

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:42.980
Say What Federation technologies
could they choose

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.610
that don't give their identity
provider access to web

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:46.430
browsing history?

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:48.380
So good news and bad news.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.620
First of all, the IDP does not
get access to your web

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.420
browsing history.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.910
It may get access to the events
when you actually

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:57.370
authenticated, but that's a
very small subset of your

00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:58.850
interactions with any site.

00:18:58.850 --> 00:18:59.750
But it's bad news.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:02.500
I mean, if the NSA really wants
to know, they will send

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.950
a legal documents to your ISP,
not your search engine, not

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.760
your IDP, your ISP.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.270
And your ISP will put a pipe
in the side of their router

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.880
and the NSA will know every
website you visit.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:19.110
And given that this is known
to be happening, whether or

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.770
not they're incrementally
tracking where you happen to

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.180
get authenticated just hasn't
seemed like a big deal to me.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:26.490
Now they are a variety of
techniques you can use to

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:28.660
increase your online privacy.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.800
But as Ed Snowden said, whereas
the encryption flowing

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.830
across the wire is pretty good,
the endpoint encryption

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:37.400
is generally terrible
and weak.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.550
And if you really want to be
secure, you have to look at

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:42.350
technologies like Tor, and
so on, which are kind of

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:44.510
inconvenient and icky to use.

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:46.040
And it's tough.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.590
I mean, it is really,
really tough.

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:49.910
And I don't think this has
anything to do with

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:50.490
technology.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:52.760
I think this is a policy
and legal problem.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:53.730
ADAM DAWES: Agreed.

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:56.560
Well, we'll see where that one
works, how that one works

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.950
itself out.

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:01.700
SAML, OAuth, OpenID Connect,
Facebook Connect, IndieAuth,

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:06.220
Persona, sometimes it seems
like there are as many

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:08.990
Federation technologies
as identity providers.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:12.530
Is there any indication that one
of these is going to win?

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:12.990
TIM BRAY: That's Bryant again.

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:14.500
Hey Bryant.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.940
So, I think none of them are
going to win in the sense of

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.590
sweeping all the others away.

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:22.780
Inside the big company
Enterprise, SAML is pretty

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.530
dominant, pretty well
everybody uses that.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:26.370
But I don't think SAML is going
to work with [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:27.310
on the broader internet.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:28.890
It's just not designed
for that.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:32.490
So I think OpenID Connect is
going to be widely deployed

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:33.820
out there because
it already is.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:34.330
We're doing it.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:35.680
Microsoft's working on it.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.230
Lots of other people are.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.500
OAuth in general, on which
OIDC is based, like for

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.240
example, the recently announced
Wordpress IPD is

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:46.080
based on OAuth 2.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:46.690
Persona's got a chance.

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:47.510
We'll see.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:49.440
By the way, I have my own little
individual identity

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.110
test bed with a little site
that you can log in to.

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:54.030
And I've wired it up to three
or four different flavors of

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.820
protocols, and I'm going to wire
it up to Persona in the

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:57.730
next few days.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:01.560
And I think living in a
multi-identity protocol future

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.320
is actually not so terrible.

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.473
I think if we end up stuck
with a few, that's OK.

00:21:06.473 --> 00:21:07.960
Nothing terribly wrong
with that.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.600
ADAM DAWES: It does add a lot of
complexity for developers,

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.650
but hopefully there will be
tools that'll make it easier

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:17.070
for developers to manage.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:20.790
Does the requirement to
pre-register my app's URL with

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:25.030
an OAuth IDP mean that I have
to let that IDP know about

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.450
secret pre-launch or
internal apps?

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:31.720
TIM BRAY: Well, yeah, but all
you really have to do is

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:36.330
register the URL, and name,
and optionally a graphic.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.730
And I don't think we're actually
looking at those, to

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:39.710
tell you the truth.

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:41.100
ADAM DAWES: No, we're not
really looking at those.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.950
And it doesn't give anybody any
ability to go beyond the

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:47.150
front door of what that
login page is.

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:50.230
So if you're in stealth
mode, just have a

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:51.660
stealthy front page.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.760
And that should do it.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.210
TIM BRAY: I think we're pretty
well out of time.

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:58.130
Thank you.

00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:59.312
That was useful.

00:21:59.312 --> 00:22:02.230
We're going to keep on working
through this on our blog, and

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:04.190
we'll probably do another one
of these ones on it, because

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:05.160
the questions keep flowing in.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.100
ADAM DAWES: And please dial into
Tim's blog to continue

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.390
the conversation.

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:09.120
TIM BRAY: Ok.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.200
Thank you for dropping by.
