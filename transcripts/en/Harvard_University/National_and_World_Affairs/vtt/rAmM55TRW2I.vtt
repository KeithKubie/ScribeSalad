00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:10.319
We are used to have be people

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:11.709
with the conditions such as

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:13.999
congestive cardiac failures, hyper tension and liver failures

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:19.550
but now we usually nurse people with epigastric diseases

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.609
such as diarrhea

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.090
aseptic meningitis

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.919
usually streptococcus

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.709
mostly HIV related more than anything else now.

00:00:30.709 --> 00:00:33.520
KwazZulu-Natal is one of the nine provinces in South Africa

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.900
and it really is the epicenter of

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:42.900
the co-epidemics in the country.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.110
the rates

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.769
of TB infection here 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:54.039
and the rates of HIV are unprecedented throughout
the country. We know here at Edendale 60%

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.430
of women, pregnant women

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.420
test HIV positive so id we extrapolate that from that

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.410
we're looking at

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.410
mid to high 40%

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.740
so just under half

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.920
of the population is HIV 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.920
infected.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.560
TB a couple decades ago
was on

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.840
the down swing, it was being controlled fairly
well

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.530
globally, 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.240
but with 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.540
HIV coming on the scene

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.460
you see TB rising exponentially because patients who are
HIV infected of course is much greater risk

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.800
of tuberculosis

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.429
so that's why TB is on the upswing

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.270
in the inner cities in the US

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.120
and definitely

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.130
in developing countries where

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.930
there's a high burden of HIV.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.420
It's the number one killer

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.270
far and away

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.830
of patients who are HIV positive.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.770
people

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.230
typically wait a very long time before they seek medical attention

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.210
so they present very where they are very very ill

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.839
and I think

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:12.219
we see a lot more people honestly die here

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:14.309
than we do in the US just because people

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:18.689
are so diseased and it presents so late

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:22.559
it receives so little treatment on the outside. 
And I think one of the biggest differences

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.419
is we see HIV probably as HIV looked in the US

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:28.290
the late '80's early '90's before there were treatments

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.979
and you see all of the

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:32.769
the infections and ravages of the disease

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:39.769
that we're not really accustomed to seeing anymore
since therapy in countries that can afford it is so good.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.680
The main thing that I've gained is just

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:49.889
a true personal experience

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.029
and understanding of it

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:55.689
you know, being here, during the epidemic

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:57.119
getting a sense of how things really are

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:59.749
you hear about it in the United States

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:02.870
but it's difficult to really

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.289
get a sense of it until you come here and you see 
the burden that 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:07.429
there is in the hospitals

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:11.979
I mean 80-90% of patients here in the hospital
are HIV positive

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:15.999
and an incredible number of those have TB as well.

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:17.169
unfortunately it took XDR 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:18.959
to generate so much international

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.709
interest in the problems

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:21.790
now we have a lot of

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:22.919
of people thinking about

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.370
what better infection control measures,

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.400
better treatment mention measures, integrating
HIV and TB care, so these things are all essential

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.599
to relook at our protocols to find out

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.939
why are we failing the standard TB treatment
in the first place

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:38.919
that are leading to both the MDR and XDR epidemics.
