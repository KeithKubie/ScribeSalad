00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.677
For the rest of the term,
we are going to be studying not

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:15.617
just one differential equation
at a time, but rather what are

00:00:15.617 --> 00:00:18.244
called systems of differential
equations.

00:00:18.244 --> 00:00:21.002
Those are like systems of
linear equations.

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:23.432
They have to be solved
simultaneously,

00:00:23.432 --> 00:00:25.928
in other words,
not just one at a time.

00:00:25.928 --> 00:00:30.000
So, how does a system look when
you write it down?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.196
Well, since we are going to be
talking about systems of

00:00:34.196 --> 00:00:38.860
ordinary differential equations,
there still will be only one

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.435
independent variable,
but there will be several

00:00:42.435 --> 00:00:45.466
dependent variables.
I am going to call,

00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:48.652
let's say two.
The dependent variables are

00:00:48.652 --> 00:00:53.471
going to be, I will call them x
and y, and then the first order

00:00:53.471 --> 00:00:57.357
system, something involving just
first derivatives,

00:00:57.357 --> 00:01:02.242
will look like this.
On the left-hand side 

00:01:02.242 --> 00:01:04.702
will be x prime,

00:01:04.702 --> 00:01:07.958
in other words.
On the right-hand side will be

00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:12.516
the dependent variables and then
also the independent variables.

00:01:12.516 --> 00:01:16.279
I will indicate that,
I will separate it all from the

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:18.811
others by putting a semicolon
there.

00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:22.863
And the same way y prime,
the derivative of y with

00:01:22.863 --> 00:01:25.974
respect to t,
will be some other function of

00:01:25.974 --> 00:01:30.076
(x, y) and t.
Let's write down explicitly

00:01:30.076 --> 00:01:33.000
that x and y are dependent
variables.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.247
And what they depend upon is
the independent variable t,

00:01:41.247 --> 00:01:43.951
time.
A system like this is going to

00:01:43.951 --> 00:01:47.813
be called first order.
And we are going to consider

00:01:47.813 --> 00:01:52.292
basically only first-order
systems for a secret reason that

00:01:52.292 --> 00:01:56.000
I will explain at the end of the
period.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.451
This is a first-order system,
meaning that the only kind of

00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:04.288
derivatives that are up here are
first derivatives.

00:02:04.288 --> 00:02:08.202
So x prime is dx over dt 
and so on.

00:02:08.202 --> 00:02:10.965
Now, there is still more
terminology.

00:02:10.965 --> 00:02:15.109
Of course, practically all the
equations after the term

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:18.793
started, virtually all the
equations we have been

00:02:18.793 --> 00:02:22.706
considering are linear
equations, so it must be true

00:02:22.706 --> 00:02:25.546
that linear systems are the best
kind.

00:02:25.546 --> 00:02:31.267
And, boy, they certainly are.
When are we going to call a

00:02:31.267 --> 00:02:34.795
system linear?
I think in the beginning you

00:02:34.795 --> 00:02:39.162
should learn a little
terminology before we launch in

00:02:39.162 --> 00:02:43.110
and actually try to start to
solve these things.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.973
Well, the x and y,
the dependent variables must

00:02:46.973 --> 00:02:49.493
occur linearly.
In other words,

00:02:49.493 --> 00:02:53.356
it must look like this,
ax plus by.

00:02:53.356 --> 00:02:58.060
Now, the t can be a mess.
And so I will throw in an extra

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.511
function of t there.
And y prime will be some

00:03:03.511 --> 00:03:08.128
other linear combination of x
and y, plus some other messy

00:03:08.128 --> 00:03:10.477
function of t.
But even the a,

00:03:10.477 --> 00:03:14.041
b, c, and d are allowed to be
functions of t.

00:03:14.041 --> 00:03:19.064
They could be one over t cubed
or sine t

00:03:19.064 --> 00:03:23.357
or something like that.
So I have to distinguish those

00:03:23.357 --> 00:03:25.220
cases.
The case where a,

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.000
b, c, and d are constants,
that I will call --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.864
Well, there are different
things you can call it.

00:03:34.864 --> 00:03:40.135
We will simply call it a
constant coefficient system.

00:03:40.135 --> 00:03:45.202
A system with coefficients
would probably be better

00:03:45.202 --> 00:03:47.837
English.
On the other hand,

00:03:47.837 --> 00:03:51.891
a, b, c, and d,
this system will still be

00:03:51.891 --> 00:03:56.047
called linear if these are
functions of t.

00:03:56.047 --> 00:04:00.000
Can also be functions of t.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.989
So it would be a perfectly good
linear system to have x prime

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.845
equals tx plus sine t times y
plus e to the minus t squared.

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:18.630
You would never see something
like that but it is okay.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.553
What else do you need to know?
Well, what would a homogenous

00:04:22.553 --> 00:04:24.946
system be?
A homogenous system is one

00:04:24.946 --> 00:04:28.670
without these extra guys.
That doesn't mean there is no t

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.621
in it.
There could be t in the a,

00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:38.571
b, c and d, but these terms
with no x and y in them must not

00:04:38.571 --> 00:04:42.000
occur.
So, a linear homogenous.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.612
And that is the kind we are
going to start studying first in

00:04:50.612 --> 00:04:53.734
the same way when we studied
higher order equations.

00:04:53.734 --> 00:04:57.163
We studied first homogenous.
You had to know how to solve

00:04:57.163 --> 00:05:00.714
those first, and then you could
learn how to solve the more

00:05:00.714 --> 00:05:04.324
general kind.
So linear homogenous means that

00:05:04.324 --> 00:05:07.175
r1 is zero and r2 is zero for
all time.

00:05:07.175 --> 00:05:10.550
They are identically zero.
They are not there.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.850
You don't see them.
Have I left anything out?

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.050
Yes, the initial conditions.
Since that is quite general,

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.000
let's talk about what would
initial conditions look like?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.339
Well, in a general way,
the reason you have to have

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:34.813
initial conditions is to get
values for the arbitrary

00:05:34.813 --> 00:05:37.284
constants that appear in the
solution.

00:05:37.284 --> 00:05:40.223
The question is,
how many arbitrary constants

00:05:40.223 --> 00:05:43.897
are going to appear in the
solutions of these equations?

00:05:43.897 --> 00:05:46.369
Well, I will just give you the
answer.

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:48.172
Two.
The number of arbitrary

00:05:48.172 --> 00:05:51.779
constants that appear is the
total order of the system.

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:53.984
For example,
if this were a second

00:05:53.984 --> 00:05:58.259
derivative and this were a first
derivative, I would expect three

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:02.000
arbitrary constants in the
system --

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.547
-- because the total,
the sum of two and one makes

00:06:05.547 --> 00:06:07.719
three.
So you must have as many

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:11.773
initial conditions as you have
arbitrary constants in the

00:06:11.773 --> 00:06:13.873
solution.
And that, of course,

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:17.276
explains when we studied
second-order equations,

00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:19.954
we had to have two initial
conditions.

00:06:19.954 --> 00:06:24.153
I had to specify the initial
starting point and the initial

00:06:24.153 --> 00:06:26.904
velocity.
And the reason we had to have

00:06:26.904 --> 00:06:30.814
two conditions was because the
general solution had two

00:06:30.814 --> 00:06:36.329
arbitrary constants in it.
The same thing happens here but

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:40.537
the answer is it is more
natural, the conditions here are

00:06:40.537 --> 00:06:43.543
more natural.
I don't have to specify the

00:06:43.543 --> 00:06:44.820
velocity.
Why not?

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.202
Well, because an initial
condition, of course,

00:06:48.202 --> 00:06:52.109
would want me to say what the
starting value of x is,

00:06:52.109 --> 00:06:55.190
some number,
and it will also want to know

00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:00.000
what the starting value of y is
at that same point.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.479
Well, there are my two
conditions.

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:07.062
And since this is going to have
two arbitrary constants in it,

00:07:07.062 --> 00:07:10.668
it is these initial conditions
that will satisfy,

00:07:10.668 --> 00:07:14.725
the arbitrary constants will
have to be picked so as to

00:07:14.725 --> 00:07:17.129
satisfy those initial
conditions.

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:19.759
In some sense,
the giving of initial

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:23.816
conditions for a system is a
more natural activity than

00:07:23.816 --> 00:07:29.000
giving the initial conditions of
a second order system.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.529
You don't have to be the least
bit cleaver about it.

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:35.020
Anybody would give these two
numbers.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.825
Whereas, somebody faced with a
second order system might

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:40.901
scratch his head.
And, in fact,

00:07:40.901 --> 00:07:43.323
there are other kinds of
conditions.

00:07:43.323 --> 00:07:47.406
There are boundary conditions
you learned a little bit about

00:07:47.406 --> 00:07:51.350
instead of initial conditions
for a second order equation.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.533
I cannot think of any more
general terminology,

00:07:54.533 --> 00:08:00.000
so it sounds like we are going
to actually have to get to work.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.035
Okay, let's get to work.
I want to set up a system and

00:08:04.035 --> 00:08:07.005
solve it.
And since one of the things in

00:08:07.005 --> 00:08:10.431
this course is supposed to be
simple modeling,

00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:13.705
it should be a system that
models something.

00:08:13.705 --> 00:08:18.121
In general, the kinds of models
we are going to use when we

00:08:18.121 --> 00:08:22.309
study systems are the same ones
we used in studying just

00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:25.964
first-order equations.
Mixing, radioactive decay,

00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:30.000
temperature,
the motion of temperature.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.838
Heat, heat conduction,
in other words.

00:08:32.838 --> 00:08:35.753
Diffusion.
I have given you a diffusion

00:08:35.753 --> 00:08:39.359
problem for your first homework
on this subject.

00:08:39.359 --> 00:08:43.119
What else did we do?
That's all I can think of for

00:08:43.119 --> 00:08:46.724
the moment, but I am sure they
will occur to me.

00:08:46.724 --> 00:08:50.944
When, out of those physical
ideas, are we going to get a

00:08:50.944 --> 00:08:52.555
system?
The answer is,

00:08:52.555 --> 00:08:56.698
whenever there are two of
something that there was only

00:08:56.698 --> 00:08:59.728
one of before.
For example,

00:08:59.728 --> 00:09:03.489
if I have mixing with two tanks
where the fluid goes like that.

00:09:03.489 --> 00:09:07.191
Say you want to have a big tank
and a little tank here and you

00:09:07.191 --> 00:09:10.952
want to put some stuff into the
little tank so that it will get

00:09:10.952 --> 00:09:14.653
mixed in the big tank without
having to climb a big ladder and

00:09:14.653 --> 00:09:17.991
stop and drop the stuff in.
That will require two tanks,

00:09:17.991 --> 00:09:20.842
the concentration of the
substance in each tank,

00:09:20.842 --> 00:09:24.543
therefore, that will require a
system of equations rather than

00:09:24.543 --> 00:09:28.429
just one.
Or, to give something closer to

00:09:28.429 --> 00:09:33.131
home, closer to this backboard,
anyway, suppose you have dah,

00:09:33.131 --> 00:09:36.501
dah, dah, don't groan,
at least not audibly,

00:09:36.501 --> 00:09:40.890
something that looks like that.
And next to it put an EMF

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.476
there.
That is just a first order.

00:09:43.476 --> 00:09:47.238
That just leads to a single
first order equation.

00:09:47.238 --> 00:09:51.000
But suppose it is a two loop
circuit.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.356
Now I need a pair of equations.
Each of these loops gives a

00:10:02.356 --> 00:10:06.338
first order differential
equation, but they have to be

00:10:06.338 --> 00:10:10.694
solved simultaneously to find
the current or the charges on

00:10:10.694 --> 00:10:14.150
the condensers.
And if I want a system of three

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.553
equations, throw in another
loop.

00:10:16.553 --> 00:10:19.258
Now, suppose I put in a coil
instead.

00:10:19.258 --> 00:10:23.464
What is this going to lead to?
This is going to give me a

00:10:23.464 --> 00:10:27.896
system of three equations of
which this will be first order,

00:10:27.896 --> 00:10:32.436
first order.
And this will be second order

00:10:32.436 --> 00:10:35.882
because it has a coil.
You are up to that,

00:10:35.882 --> 00:10:37.815
right?
You've had coils,

00:10:37.815 --> 00:10:39.159
inductance?
Good.

00:10:39.159 --> 00:10:43.445
So the whole thing is going to
count as first-order,

00:10:43.445 --> 00:10:45.546
first-order,
second-order.

00:10:45.546 --> 00:10:50.252
To find out how complicated it
is, you have to add up the

00:10:50.252 --> 00:10:52.521
orders.
That is one and one,

00:10:52.521 --> 00:10:55.462
and two.
This is really fourth-order

00:10:55.462 --> 00:11:00.000
stuff that we are talking about
here.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.141
We can expect it to be a little
complicated.

00:11:03.141 --> 00:11:06.356
Well, now let's take a modest
little problem.

00:11:06.356 --> 00:11:10.520
I am going to return to a
problem we considered earlier in

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:14.977
the problem of heat conduction.
I had forgotten whether it was

00:11:14.977 --> 00:11:19.360
on the problem set or I did it
in class, but I am choosing it

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.305
because it leads to something we
will be able to solve.

00:11:23.305 --> 00:11:27.689
And because it illustrates how
to add a little sophistication

00:11:27.689 --> 00:11:32.000
to something that was
unsophisticated before.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.677
A pot of water.
External temperature Te of t.

00:11:35.677 --> 00:11:38.414
I am talking about the

00:11:38.414 --> 00:11:43.203
temperature of something.
And what I am talking about the

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:47.651
temperature of will be an egg
that is cooking inside,

00:11:47.651 --> 00:11:51.756
but with a difference.
This egg is not homogenous

00:11:51.756 --> 00:11:54.835
inside.
Instead it has a white and it

00:11:54.835 --> 00:11:59.048
has a yolk in the middle.
In other words,

00:11:59.048 --> 00:12:01.563
it is a real egg and not a
phony egg.

00:12:01.563 --> 00:12:04.637
That is a small pot,
or it is an ostrich egg.

00:12:04.637 --> 00:12:08.410
[LAUGHTER] That is the yoke.
The yolk is contained in a

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:11.834
little membrane inside.
And there are little yucky

00:12:11.834 --> 00:12:15.956
things that hold it in position.
And we are going to let the

00:12:15.956 --> 00:12:19.659
temperature of the yolk,
if you can see in the back of

00:12:19.659 --> 00:12:22.873
the room, be T1.
That is the temperature of the

00:12:22.873 --> 00:12:25.248
yolk.
The temperature of the white,

00:12:25.248 --> 00:12:30.000
which we will assume is
uniform, is going to be T2.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.672
Oh, that's the water bath.
The temperature of the white is

00:12:34.672 --> 00:12:39.180
T2, and then the temperature of
the external water bath.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:42.868
In other words,
the reason for introducing two

00:12:42.868 --> 00:12:47.540
variables instead of just the
one variable for the overall

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:52.786
temperature of the egg we had is
because egg white is liquid pure

00:12:52.786 --> 00:12:57.049
protein, more or less,
and the T1, the yolk has a lot

00:12:57.049 --> 00:13:01.639
of fat and cholesterol and other
stuff like that which is

00:13:01.639 --> 00:13:06.503
supposed to be bad for you.
It certainly has different

00:13:06.503 --> 00:13:07.890
conducting.
It is liquid,

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:11.301
at the beginning at any rate,
but it certainly has different

00:13:11.301 --> 00:13:14.192
constants of conductivity than
the egg white would.

00:13:14.192 --> 00:13:17.256
And the condition of heat
through the shell of the egg

00:13:17.256 --> 00:13:20.552
would be different from the
conduction of heat through the

00:13:20.552 --> 00:13:22.691
membrane that keeps the yoke
together.

00:13:22.691 --> 00:13:26.102
So it is quite reasonable to
consider that the white and the

00:13:26.102 --> 00:13:29.051
yolk will be at different
temperatures and will have

00:13:29.051 --> 00:13:32.000
different conductivity
properties.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.216
I am going to use Newton's laws
but with this further

00:13:36.216 --> 00:13:38.324
refinement.
In other words,

00:13:38.324 --> 00:13:43.189
introducing two temperatures.
Whereas, before we only had one

00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:46.351
temperature.
But let's use Newton's law.

00:13:46.351 --> 00:13:49.432
Let's see.
The question is how does T1,

00:13:49.432 --> 00:13:52.918
the temperature of the yolk,
vary with time?

00:13:52.918 --> 00:13:57.216
Well, the yolk is getting all
its heat from the white.

00:13:57.216 --> 00:14:01.918
Therefore, Newton's law of
conduction will be some constant

00:14:01.918 --> 00:14:08.000
of conductivity for the yolk
times T2 minus T1.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.488
The yolk does not know anything
about the external temperature

00:14:12.488 --> 00:14:15.872
of the water bath.
It is completely surrounded,

00:14:15.872 --> 00:14:20.214
snug and secure within itself.
But how about the temperature

00:14:20.214 --> 00:14:23.598
of the egg white?
That gets heat and gives heat

00:14:23.598 --> 00:14:26.688
to two sources,
from the external water and

00:14:26.688 --> 00:14:30.000
also from the internal yolk
inside.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.325
So you have to take into
account both of those.

00:14:33.325 --> 00:14:36.795
Its conduction of the heat
through that membrane,

00:14:36.795 --> 00:14:40.698
we will use the same a,
which is going to be a times T1

00:14:40.698 --> 00:14:44.674
minus T2.
Remember the order in which you

00:14:44.674 --> 00:14:48.795
have to write these is governed
by the yolk outside to the

00:14:48.795 --> 00:14:51.180
white.
Therefore, that has to come

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:55.518
first when I write it in order
that a be a positive constant.

00:14:55.518 --> 00:15:00.000
But it is also getting heat
from the water bath.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.423
And, presumably,
the conductivity through the

00:15:03.423 --> 00:15:08.247
shell is different from what it
is through this membrane around

00:15:08.247 --> 00:15:11.359
the yolk.
So I am going to call that by a

00:15:11.359 --> 00:15:14.704
different constant.
This is the conductivity

00:15:14.704 --> 00:15:17.194
through the shell into the
white.

00:15:17.194 --> 00:15:21.551
And that is going to be T,
the external temperature minus

00:15:21.551 --> 00:15:24.041
the temperature of the egg
white.

00:15:24.041 --> 00:15:28.320
Here I have a system of
equations because I want to make

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:34.000
two dependent variables by
refining the original problem.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.667
Now, you always have to write a
system in standard form to solve

00:15:39.667 --> 00:15:42.726
it.
You will see that the left-hand

00:15:42.726 --> 00:15:47.854
side will give the dependent
variables in a certain order.

00:15:47.854 --> 00:15:51.813
In this case,
the temperature of the yolk and

00:15:51.813 --> 00:15:54.782
then the temperature of the
white.

00:15:54.782 --> 00:16:00.000
The law is that in order not to
make mistakes --

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.827
And it's a very frequent source
of error so learn from the

00:16:03.827 --> 00:16:07.587
beginning not to do this.
You must write the variables on

00:16:07.587 --> 00:16:11.549
the right-hand side in the same
order left to right in which

00:16:11.549 --> 00:16:14.570
they occur top to bottom here.
In other words,

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:16.988
this is not a good way to leave
that.

00:16:16.988 --> 00:16:20.211
This is the first attempt in
writing this system,

00:16:20.211 --> 00:16:22.762
but the final version should
like this.

00:16:22.762 --> 00:16:25.985
T1 prime,
I won't bother writing dT / dt,

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:29.888
is equal to --
T1 must come first,

00:16:29.888 --> 00:16:34.857
so minus a times T1 plus a
times T2.

00:16:34.857 --> 00:16:38.335
And the same law for the second
one.

00:16:38.335 --> 00:16:44.099
It must come in the same order.
Now, the coefficient of T1,

00:16:44.099 --> 00:16:47.180
that is easy.
That's a times T1.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:52.248
The coefficient of T2 is minus
a minus b,

00:16:52.248 --> 00:16:56.521
so minus (a plus b) times T2.

00:16:56.521 --> 00:17:02.600
But I am not done yet.
There is still this external

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.315
temperature I must put into the
equation.

00:17:06.315 --> 00:17:11.702
Now, that is not a variable.
This is some given function of

00:17:11.702 --> 00:17:14.674
t.
And what the function of t is,

00:17:14.674 --> 00:17:18.668
of course, depends upon what
the problem is.

00:17:18.668 --> 00:17:22.291
So that, for example,
what might be some

00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:26.470
possibilities,
well, suppose the problem was I

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:32.349
wanted to coddle the egg.
I think there is a generation

00:17:32.349 --> 00:17:35.265
gap here.
How many of you know what a

00:17:35.265 --> 00:17:38.667
coddled egg is?
How many of you don't know?

00:17:38.667 --> 00:17:42.312
Well, I'm just saying my
daughter didn't know.

00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:46.525
I mentioned it to her.
I said I think I'm going to do

00:17:46.525 --> 00:17:51.223
a coddled egg tomorrow in class.
And she said what is that?

00:17:51.223 --> 00:17:55.597
And so I said a cuddled egg?
She said why would someone

00:17:55.597 --> 00:17:59.000
cuddle an egg?
I said coddle.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.542
And she said,
oh, you mean like a person,

00:18:02.542 --> 00:18:07.414
like what you do to somebody
you like or don't like or I

00:18:07.414 --> 00:18:09.185
don't know.
Whatever.

00:18:09.185 --> 00:18:13.437
I thought a while and said,
yeah, more like that.

00:18:13.437 --> 00:18:17.334
[LAUGHTER] Anyway,
for the enrichment of your

00:18:17.334 --> 00:18:20.168
cooking skills,
to coddle an egg,

00:18:20.168 --> 00:18:25.128
it is considered to produce a
better quality product than

00:18:25.128 --> 00:18:30.000
boiling an egg.
That is why people do it.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.208
You heat up the water to
boiling, the egg should be at

00:18:34.208 --> 00:18:37.781
room temperature,
and then you carefully lower

00:18:37.781 --> 00:18:41.831
the egg into the water.
And you turn off the heat so

00:18:41.831 --> 00:18:45.563
the water bath cools
exponentially while the egg

00:18:45.563 --> 00:18:50.486
inside is rising in temperature.
And then you wait four minutes

00:18:50.486 --> 00:18:53.821
or six minutes or whatever and
take it out.

00:18:53.821 --> 00:18:56.918
You have a perfect egg.
So for coddling,

00:18:56.918 --> 00:19:02.000
spelled so, what will the
external temperature be?

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.010
Well, it starts out at time
zero at 100 degrees centigrade

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:09.035
because the water is supposed to
be boiling.

00:19:09.035 --> 00:19:13.256
The reason you have it boiling
is for calibration so that you

00:19:13.256 --> 00:19:17.055
can know what temperature it is
without having to use a

00:19:17.055 --> 00:19:20.924
thermometer, unless you're on
Pike's Peak or some place.

00:19:20.924 --> 00:19:24.020
It starts out at 100 degrees.
And after that,

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.608
since the light is off,
it cools exponential because

00:19:27.608 --> 00:19:32.652
that is another law.
You only have to know what K is

00:19:32.652 --> 00:19:37.443
for your particular pot and you
will be able to solve the

00:19:37.443 --> 00:19:40.438
coddled egg problem.
In other words,

00:19:40.438 --> 00:19:45.743
you will then be able to solve
these equations and know how the

00:19:45.743 --> 00:19:49.935
temperature rises.
I am going to solve a different

00:19:49.935 --> 00:19:54.470
problem because I don't want to
have to deal with this

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:58.235
inhomogeneous term.
Let's use, as a different

00:19:58.235 --> 00:20:04.536
problem, a person cooks an egg.
Coddles the egg by the first

00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:09.428
process, decides the egg is
done, let's say hardboiled,

00:20:09.428 --> 00:20:14.773
and then you are supposed to
drop a hardboiled egg into cold

00:20:14.773 --> 00:20:17.853
water.
Not just to cool it but also

00:20:17.853 --> 00:20:23.289
because I think it prevents that
dark thing from forming that

00:20:23.289 --> 00:20:28.000
looks sort of unattractive.
Let's ice bath.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.722
The only reason for dropping
the egg into an ice bath is so

00:20:32.722 --> 00:20:36.793
that you could have a homogenous
equation to solve.

00:20:36.793 --> 00:20:40.946
And since this a first system
we are going to solve,

00:20:40.946 --> 00:20:43.715
let's make life easy for
ourselves.

00:20:43.715 --> 00:20:47.134
Now, all my work in preparing
this example,

00:20:47.134 --> 00:20:52.101
and it took considerably longer
time than actually solving the

00:20:52.101 --> 00:20:56.824
problem, was in picking values
for a and b which would make

00:20:56.824 --> 00:21:02.215
everything come out nice.
It's harder than it looks.

00:21:02.215 --> 00:21:07.159
The values that we are going to
use, which make no physical

00:21:07.159 --> 00:21:11.164
sense whatsoever,
but a equals 2 and b

00:21:11.164 --> 00:21:15.340
equals 3.
These are called nice numbers.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:18.750
What is the equation?
What is the system?

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.392
Can somebody read it off for
me?

00:21:21.392 --> 00:21:26.505
It is T1 prime equals, what
is it, minus 2T1 plus 2T2.

00:21:26.505 --> 00:21:30.000
That's good.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Minus 2T1 plus 2T2.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.677
T2 prime is,
what is it?

00:21:42.677 --> 00:21:48.264
I think this is 2T1.
And the other one is minus a

00:21:48.264 --> 00:21:51.873
plus b, so minus 5.

00:21:51.873 --> 00:21:57.343
This is a system.
Now, on Wednesday I will teach

00:21:57.343 --> 00:22:03.203
you a fancy way of solving this.
But, to be honest,

00:22:03.203 --> 00:22:07.213
the fancy way will take roughly
about as long as the way I am

00:22:07.213 --> 00:22:10.555
going to do it now.
The main reason for doing it is

00:22:10.555 --> 00:22:14.097
that it introduces new
vocabulary which everyone wants

00:22:14.097 --> 00:22:16.503
you to have.
And also, more important

00:22:16.503 --> 00:22:20.313
reasons, it gives more insight
into the solution than this

00:22:20.313 --> 00:22:22.719
method.
This method just produces the

00:22:22.719 --> 00:22:24.992
answer, but you want insight,
also.

00:22:24.992 --> 00:22:28.853
And that is just as important.
But for now,

00:22:28.853 --> 00:22:33.048
let's use a method which always
works and which in 40 years,

00:22:33.048 --> 00:22:36.461
after you have forgotten all
other fancy methods,

00:22:36.461 --> 00:22:40.584
will still be available to you
because it is method you can

00:22:40.584 --> 00:22:43.855
figure out yourself.
You don't have to remember

00:22:43.855 --> 00:22:46.628
anything.
The method is to eliminate one

00:22:46.628 --> 00:22:50.538
of the dependent variables.
It is just the way you solve

00:22:50.538 --> 00:22:54.591
systems of linear equations in
general if you aren't doing

00:22:54.591 --> 00:22:59.000
something fancy with
determinants and matrices.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.413
If you just eliminate
variables.

00:23:01.413 --> 00:23:05.149
We are going to eliminate one
of these variables.

00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:08.808
Let's eliminate T2.
You could also eliminate T1.

00:23:08.808 --> 00:23:13.479
The main thing is eliminate one
of them so you will have just

00:23:13.479 --> 00:23:16.904
one left to work with.
How do I eliminate T2?

00:23:16.904 --> 00:23:19.628
Beg your pardon?
Is something wrong?

00:23:19.628 --> 00:23:23.676
If somebody thinks something is
wrong raise his hand.

00:23:23.676 --> 00:23:25.000
No?

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.229
Why do I want to get rid of T1?
Well, I can add them.

00:23:33.229 --> 00:23:36.645
But, on the left-hand side,
I will have T1 prime plus T2

00:23:36.645 --> 00:23:39.006
prime. What good is that?

00:23:39.006 --> 00:23:40.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.510
I think you will want to do it
my way.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:50.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.577
Solve for T2 in terms of T1.
That is going to be T1 prime

00:24:08.577 --> 00:24:12.661
plus 2T1 divided by 2.

00:24:12.661 --> 00:24:18.338
Now, take that and substitute
it into the second equation.

00:24:18.338 --> 00:24:21.725
Wherever you see a T2,
put that in,

00:24:21.725 --> 00:24:28.000
and what you will be left with
is something just in T1.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.450
To be honest,
I don't know any other good way

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:34.901
of doing this.
There is a fancy method that I

00:24:34.901 --> 00:24:39.607
think is talked about in your
book, which leads to extraneous

00:24:39.607 --> 00:24:43.215
solutions and so on,
but you don't want to know

00:24:43.215 --> 00:24:46.196
about that.
This will work for a simple

00:24:46.196 --> 00:24:49.490
linear equation with constant
coefficients,

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:51.137
always.
Substitute in.

00:24:51.137 --> 00:24:54.588
What do I do?
Now, here I do not advise doing

00:24:54.588 --> 00:24:57.960
this mentally.
It is just too easy to make a

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:04.349
mistake.
Here, I will do it carefully,

00:25:04.349 --> 00:25:10.349
writing everything out just as
you would.

00:25:10.349 --> 00:25:18.599
T1 prime plus 2T1 over 2,
prime, equals 2T1 minus 5 time

00:25:18.599 --> 00:25:27.299
T1 prime plus 2T1 over two.

00:25:27.299 --> 00:25:32.977
I took that and substituted

00:25:32.977 --> 00:25:38.382
into this equation.
Now, I don't like those two's.

00:25:38.382 --> 00:25:42.352
Let's get rid of them by
multiplying.

00:25:42.352 --> 00:25:45.000
This will become 4.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.032
And now write this out.
What is this when you look at

00:25:57.032 --> 00:26:00.322
it?
This is an equation just in T1.

00:26:00.322 --> 00:26:05.258
It has constant coefficients.
And what is its order?

00:26:05.258 --> 00:26:10.193
Its order is two because T1
prime primed.

00:26:10.193 --> 00:26:13.967
In other words,
I can eliminate T2 okay,

00:26:13.967 --> 00:26:19.870
but the equation I am going to
get is no longer a first-order.

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:24.419
It becomes a second-order
differential equation.

00:26:24.419 --> 00:26:30.133
And that's a basic law.
Even if you have a system of

00:26:30.133 --> 00:26:33.257
more equations,
three or four or whatever,

00:26:33.257 --> 00:26:37.828
the law is that after you do
the elimination successfully and

00:26:37.828 --> 00:26:42.095
end up with a single equation,
normally the order of that

00:26:42.095 --> 00:26:46.895
equation will be the sum of the
orders of the things you started

00:26:46.895 --> 00:26:49.409
with.
So two first-order equations

00:26:49.409 --> 00:26:53.219
will always produce a
second-order equation in just

00:26:53.219 --> 00:26:56.952
one dependent variable,
three will produce a third

00:26:56.952 --> 00:27:02.325
order equation and so on.
So you trade one complexity for

00:27:02.325 --> 00:27:04.950
another.
You trade the complexity of

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:09.075
having to deal with two
equations simultaneously instead

00:27:09.075 --> 00:27:13.650
of just one for the complexity
of having to deal with a single

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:17.549
higher order equation which is
more trouble to solve.

00:27:17.549 --> 00:27:20.250
It is like all mathematical
problems.

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:24.450
Unless you are very lucky,
if you push them down one way,

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:28.500
they are really simple now,
they just pop up some place

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.812
else.
You say, oh,

00:27:30.812 --> 00:27:32.979
I didn't save anything after
all.

00:27:32.979 --> 00:27:36.907
That is the law of conservation
of mathematical difficulty.

00:27:36.907 --> 00:27:40.632
[LAUGHTER] You saw that even
with the Laplace transform.

00:27:40.632 --> 00:27:44.424
In the beginning it looks
great, you've got these tables,

00:27:44.424 --> 00:27:46.862
take the equation,
horrible to solve.

00:27:46.862 --> 00:27:50.316
Take some transform,
trivial to solve for capital Y.

00:27:50.316 --> 00:27:53.566
Now I have to find the inverse
Laplace transform.

00:27:53.566 --> 00:27:57.155
And suddenly all the work is
there, partial fractions,

00:27:57.155 --> 00:28:02.173
funny formulas and so on.
It is very hard in mathematics

00:28:02.173 --> 00:28:06.086
to get away with something.
It happens now and then and

00:28:06.086 --> 00:28:09.565
everybody cheers.
Let's write this out now in the

00:28:09.565 --> 00:28:13.985
form in which it looks like an
equation we can actually solve.

00:28:13.985 --> 00:28:17.318
Just be careful.
Now it is all right to use the

00:28:17.318 --> 00:28:19.710
method by which you collect
terms.

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:23.188
There is only one term
involving T1 double prime.

00:28:23.188 --> 00:28:25.579
It's the one that comes from
here.

00:28:25.579 --> 00:28:27.826
How about the terms in T1
prime?

00:28:27.826 --> 00:28:33.137
There is a 2.
Here, there is minus 5 T1

00:28:33.137 --> 00:28:37.529
prime.
If I put it on the other side

00:28:37.529 --> 00:28:44.431
it makes plus 5 T1 prime plus
this two makes 7 T1 prime.

00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:51.333
And how many T1's are there?
Well, none on the left-hand

00:28:51.333 --> 00:28:55.850
side.
On the right-hand side I have 4

00:28:55.850 --> 00:29:02.000
here minus 10.
4 minus 10 is negative 6.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.873
Negative 6 T1 put on this
left-hand side the way we want

00:29:06.873 --> 00:29:09.000
to do makes plus 6 T1.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.866
There are no inhomogeneous
terms, so that is equal to zero.

00:29:18.866 --> 00:29:22.133
If I had gotten a negative
number for one of these

00:29:22.133 --> 00:29:25.066
coefficients,
I would instantly know if I had

00:29:25.066 --> 00:29:26.333
made a mistake.
Why?

00:29:26.333 --> 00:29:30.000
Why must those numbers come out
to be positive?

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.939
It is because the system must
be, the system must be,

00:29:33.939 --> 00:29:36.136
fill in with one word,
stable.

00:29:36.136 --> 00:29:38.712
And why must this system be
stable?

00:29:38.712 --> 00:29:42.196
In other words,
the long-term solutions must be

00:29:42.196 --> 00:29:45.530
zero, must all go to zero,
whatever they are.

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:48.636
Why is that?
Well, because you are putting

00:29:48.636 --> 00:29:52.500
the egg into an ice bath.
Or, because we know it was

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:56.136
living but after being
hardboiled it is dead and,

00:29:56.136 --> 00:30:00.000
therefore, dead systems are
stable.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.226
That's not a good reason but it
is, so to speak,

00:30:03.226 --> 00:30:05.903
the real one.
It's clear anyway that all

00:30:05.903 --> 00:30:08.512
solutions must tend to zero
physically.

00:30:08.512 --> 00:30:10.572
That's obvious.
And, therefore,

00:30:10.572 --> 00:30:14.210
the differential equation must
have the same property,

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:17.848
and that means that its
coefficients must be positive.

00:30:17.848 --> 00:30:20.389
All its coefficients must be
positive.

00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:23.478
If this weren't there,
I would get oscillating

00:30:23.478 --> 00:30:25.949
solutions, which wouldn't go to
zero.

00:30:25.949 --> 00:30:30.000
That is physical impossible for
this egg.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.993
Now the rest is just solving.
The characteristic equation,

00:30:34.993 --> 00:30:39.637
if you can remember way,
way back in prehistoric times

00:30:39.637 --> 00:30:43.580
when we were solving these
equations, is this.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.734
And what you want to do is
factor it.

00:30:46.734 --> 00:30:51.990
This is where all the work was,
getting those numbers so that

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:56.283
this would factor. So it's
r plus 1 times r plus 6

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.760
And so the solutions are,
the roots are r equals 

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:10.580
negative 1.
I am just making marks on the

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:13.400
board, but you have done this
often enough,

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.549
you know what I am talking
about.

00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:18.839
So the characteristic roots are
those two numbers.

00:31:18.839 --> 00:31:20.920
And, therefore,
the solution is,

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:24.949
I could write down immediately
with its arbitrary constant as

00:31:24.949 --> 00:31:28.911
c1 times e to the negative t
plus c2 times e to the negative

00:31:28.911 --> 00:31:34.284
6t. Now, I have got to get T2.

00:31:34.284 --> 00:31:39.030
Here the first worry is T2 is
going to give me two more

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:42.018
arbitrary constants.
It better not.

00:31:42.018 --> 00:31:47.290
The system is only allowed to
have two arbitrary constants in

00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:52.915
its solution because that is the
initial conditions we are giving

00:31:52.915 --> 00:31:55.639
it.
By the way, I forgot to give

00:31:55.639 --> 00:32:01.000
initial conditions.
Let's give initial conditions.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.020
Let's say the initial
temperature of the yolk,

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:10.023
when it is put in the ice bath,
is 40 degrees centigrade,

00:32:10.023 --> 00:32:13.149
Celsius.
And T2, let's say the white

00:32:13.149 --> 00:32:18.688
ought to be a little hotter than
the yolk is always cooler than

00:32:18.688 --> 00:32:22.708
the white for a soft boiled egg,
I don't know,

00:32:22.708 --> 00:32:27.533
or a hardboiled egg if it
hasn't been chilled too long.

00:32:27.533 --> 00:32:32.000
Let's make this 45.
Realistic numbers.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.952
Now, the thing not to do is to
say, hey, I found T1.

00:32:35.952 --> 00:32:39.207
Okay, I will find T2 by the
same procedure.

00:32:39.207 --> 00:32:41.765
I will go through the whole
thing.

00:32:41.765 --> 00:32:45.950
I will eliminate T1 instead.
Then I will end up with an

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:50.289
equation T2 and I will solve
that and get T2 equals blah,

00:32:50.289 --> 00:32:52.382
blah, blah.
That is no good,

00:32:52.382 --> 00:32:56.877
A, because you are working too
hard and, B, because you are

00:32:56.877 --> 00:33:01.450
going to get two more arbitrary
constants unrelated to these

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:04.602
two.
And that is no good.

00:33:04.602 --> 00:33:09.169
Because the correct solution
only has two constants in it.

00:33:09.169 --> 00:33:12.053
Not four.
So that procedure is wrong.

00:33:12.053 --> 00:33:15.899
You must calculate T2 from the
T1 that you found,

00:33:15.899 --> 00:33:18.943
and that is the equation which
does it.

00:33:18.943 --> 00:33:22.949
That's the one we have to have.
Where is the chalk?

00:33:22.949 --> 00:33:25.753
Yes.
Maybe I can have a little thing

00:33:25.753 --> 00:33:30.000
so I can just carry this around
with me.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.055
That is the relation between T2
and T1.

00:33:40.055 --> 00:33:44.398
Or, if you don't like it,
either one of these equations

00:33:44.398 --> 00:33:47.454
will express T2 in terms of T1
for you.

00:33:47.454 --> 00:33:50.671
It doesn't matter.
Whichever one you use,

00:33:50.671 --> 00:33:53.968
however you do it,
that's the way you must

00:33:53.968 --> 00:33:56.139
calculate T2.
So what is it?

00:33:56.139 --> 00:34:00.000
T2 is calculated from that pink
box.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.350
It is one-half of T1 prime plus
T1.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:11.436
Now, if I take the derivative
of this, I get minus c1 times

00:34:11.436 --> 00:34:16.052
the exponential.
The coefficient is minus c1,

00:34:16.052 --> 00:34:21.088
take half of that,
that is minus a half c1

00:34:21.088 --> 00:34:26.649
and add it to T1.
Minus one-half c1 plus c1 gives

00:34:26.649 --> 00:34:32.000
me one-half c1.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:38.291
And here I take the derivative,
it is minus 6 c2.

00:34:38.291 --> 00:34:44.451
Take half of that,
minus 3 c2 and add this c2 to

00:34:44.451 --> 00:34:48.645
it, minus 3 plus 1 makes minus
2.

00:34:48.645 --> 00:34:53.626
That is T2.
And notice it uses the same

00:34:53.626 --> 00:34:59.000
arbitrary constants that T1
uses.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.544
So we end up with just two
because we calculated T2 from

00:35:02.544 --> 00:35:06.089
that formula or from the
equation which is equivalent to

00:35:06.089 --> 00:35:09.312
it, not from scratch.
We haven't put in the initial

00:35:09.312 --> 00:35:11.761
conditions yet,
but that is easy to do.

00:35:11.761 --> 00:35:14.404
Everybody, when working with
exponentials,

00:35:14.404 --> 00:35:18.335
of course, you always want the
initial conditions to be when T

00:35:18.335 --> 00:35:21.687
is equal to zero
because that makes all the

00:35:21.687 --> 00:35:25.232
exponentials one and you don't
have to worry about them.

00:35:25.232 --> 00:35:27.875
But this you know.
If I put in the initial

00:35:27.875 --> 00:35:32.000
conditions, at time zero,
T1 has the value 40.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:38.024
So 40 should be equal to c1 +
c2.

00:35:38.024 --> 00:35:45.647
And the other equation will say
that 45 is equal to one-half c1

00:35:45.647 --> 00:35:52.409
minus 2 c2. 
Now we are supposed to

00:35:52.409 --> 00:35:57.327
solve these.
Well, this is called solving

00:35:57.327 --> 00:36:05.308
simultaneous linear equations.
We could use Kramer's rule,

00:36:05.308 --> 00:36:09.964
inverse matrices,
but why don't we just

00:36:09.964 --> 00:36:12.537
eliminate.
Let me see.

00:36:12.537 --> 00:36:17.438
If I multiply by,
45, so multiply by two,

00:36:17.438 --> 00:36:23.565
you get 90 equals c1 
minus 4 c2.

00:36:23.565 --> 00:36:27.976
Then subtract this guy from
that guy.

00:36:27.976 --> 00:36:35.503
So, 40 taken from 90 makes 50.
And c1 taken from c1,

00:36:35.503 --> 00:36:40.153
because I multiplied by two,
makes zero.

00:36:40.153 --> 00:36:47.307
And c2 taken from minus 4 c2,
that makes minus 5 c2,

00:36:47.307 --> 00:36:49.811
I guess.

00:36:49.811 --> 00:36:56.130
I seem to get c2 is equal to
negative 10.

00:36:56.130 --> 00:37:04.000
And if c2 is negative 10,
then c1 must be 50.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.919
There are two ways of checking
the answer.

00:37:07.919 --> 00:37:13.272
One is to plug it into the
equations, and the other is to

00:37:13.272 --> 00:37:15.470
peak.
Yes, that's right.

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:17.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.517
The final answer is,
in other words,

00:37:27.517 --> 00:37:30.755
you put a 50 here,
25 there, negative 10 here,

00:37:30.755 --> 00:37:34.352
and positive 20 there.
That gives the answer to the

00:37:34.352 --> 00:37:35.863
problem.
It tells you,

00:37:35.863 --> 00:37:39.172
in other words,
how the temperature of the yolk

00:37:39.172 --> 00:37:43.417
varies with time and how the
temperature of the white varies

00:37:43.417 --> 00:37:46.879
with time.
As I said, we are going to

00:37:46.879 --> 00:37:51.072
learn a slick way of doing this
problem, or at least a very

00:37:51.072 --> 00:37:54.614
different way of doing the same
problem next time,

00:37:54.614 --> 00:37:57.506
but let's put that on ice for
the moment.

00:37:57.506 --> 00:38:01.481
And instead I would like to
spend the rest of the period

00:38:01.481 --> 00:38:05.674
doing for first order systems
the same thing that I did for

00:38:05.674 --> 00:38:09.000
you the very first day of the
term.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.145
Remember, I walked in assuming
that you knew how to separate

00:38:13.145 --> 00:38:17.432
variables the first day of the
term, and I did not talk to you

00:38:17.432 --> 00:38:21.297
about how to solve fancier
equations by fancier methods.

00:38:21.297 --> 00:38:25.232
I instead talked to you about
the geometric significance,

00:38:25.232 --> 00:38:29.589
what the geometric meaning of a
single first order equation was

00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:33.313
and how that geometric meaning
enabled you to solve it

00:38:33.313 --> 00:38:36.654
numerically.
And we spent a little while

00:38:36.654 --> 00:38:40.393
working on such problems because
nowadays with computers it is

00:38:40.393 --> 00:38:44.070
really important that you get a
feeling for what these things

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:47.196
mean as opposed to just
algorithms for solving them.

00:38:47.196 --> 00:38:50.690
As I say, most differential
equations, especially systems,

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:54.000
are likely to be solved by a
computer anyway.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.978
You have to be the guiding
genius that interprets the

00:38:57.978 --> 00:39:01.650
answers and can see when
mistakes are being made,

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:04.021
stuff like that.
The problem is,

00:39:04.021 --> 00:39:08.000
therefore, what is the meaning
of this system?

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.739
Well, you are not going to get
anywhere interpreting it

00:39:18.739 --> 00:39:21.855
geometrically,
unless you get rid of that t on

00:39:21.855 --> 00:39:25.387
the right-hand side.
And the only way of getting rid

00:39:25.387 --> 00:39:28.019
of the t is to declare it is not
there.

00:39:28.019 --> 00:39:31.135
So I hereby declare that I will
only consider,

00:39:31.135 --> 00:39:34.736
for the rest of the period,
that is only ten minutes,

00:39:34.736 --> 00:39:38.684
systems in which no t appears
explicitly on the right-hand

00:39:38.684 --> 00:39:42.375
side.
Because I don't know what to do

00:39:42.375 --> 00:39:45.747
if it does up here.
We have a word for these.

00:39:45.747 --> 00:39:48.659
Remember what the first order
word was?

00:39:48.659 --> 00:39:53.256
A first order equation where
there was no t explicitly on the

00:39:53.256 --> 00:39:55.478
right-hand side,
we called it,

00:39:55.478 --> 00:39:57.777
anybody remember?
Just curious.

00:39:57.777 --> 00:40:00.000
Autonomous, right.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.591
This is an autonomous system.
It is not a linear system

00:40:08.591 --> 00:40:10.785
because these are messy
functions.

00:40:10.785 --> 00:40:14.709
This could be x times y
or x squared minus 3y squared

00:40:14.709 --> 00:40:18.500
divided by sine of x plus y.

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:21.226
It could be a mess.
Definitely not linear.

00:40:21.226 --> 00:40:24.485
But autonomous means no t.
t means the independent

00:40:24.485 --> 00:40:27.078
variable appears on the
right-hand side.

00:40:27.078 --> 00:40:30.536
Of course, it is there.
It is buried in the dx/dt and

00:40:30.536 --> 00:40:33.675
dy/dt.
But it is not on the right-hand

00:40:33.675 --> 00:40:35.567
side.
No t appears on the right-hand

00:40:35.567 --> 00:40:36.000
side.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.984
Because no t appears on the
right-hand side,

00:40:44.984 --> 00:40:47.949
I can now draw a picture of
this.

00:40:47.949 --> 00:40:52.212
But, let's see,
what does a solution look like?

00:40:52.212 --> 00:40:56.382
I never even talked about what
a solution was,

00:40:56.382 --> 00:40:59.718
did I?
Well, pretend that immediately

00:40:59.718 --> 00:41:05.000
after I talked about that,
I talked about this.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.437
What is the solution?
Well, the solution,

00:41:07.437 --> 00:41:10.666
maybe you took it for granted,
is a pair of functions,

00:41:10.666 --> 00:41:13.896
x of t, y of t if when 
you plug it in

00:41:13.896 --> 00:41:16.942
it satisfies the equation.
And so what else is new?

00:41:16.942 --> 00:41:19.623
The solution is x 
equals x of t,

00:41:19.623 --> 00:41:22.000
y equals y of t.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.975
If I draw a picture of that
what would it look like?

00:41:30.975 --> 00:41:35.418
This is where your previous
knowledge of physics above all

00:41:35.418 --> 00:41:39.550
18.02, maybe 18.01 if you
learned this in high school,

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:44.305
what is x equals x of t and 
y equals y of t?

00:41:44.305 --> 00:41:47.033
How do you draw a picture of

00:41:47.033 --> 00:41:49.216
that?
What does it represent?

00:41:49.216 --> 00:41:52.100
A curve.
And what will be the title of

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:56.699
the chapter of the calculus book
in which that is discussed?

00:41:56.699 --> 00:42:02.000
Parametric equations.
This is a parameterized curve.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.174
So we know what the solution
looks like.

00:42:15.174 --> 00:42:18.186
Our solution is a parameterized
curve.

00:42:18.186 --> 00:42:21.848
And what does a parameterized
curve look like?

00:42:21.848 --> 00:42:26.000
Well, it travels,
and in a certain direction.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.360
Okay.
That's enough.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.011
Why do I have several of those
curves?

00:42:38.011 --> 00:42:40.732
Well, because I have several
solutions.

00:42:40.732 --> 00:42:43.669
In fact, given any initial
starting point,

00:42:43.669 --> 00:42:46.534
there is a solution that goes
through it.

00:42:46.534 --> 00:42:49.256
I will put in possible starting
points.

00:42:49.256 --> 00:42:53.195
And you can do this on the
computer screen with a little

00:42:53.195 --> 00:42:56.991
program you will have,
one of the visuals you'll have.

00:42:56.991 --> 00:43:01.826
It's being made right now.
You put down starter point,

00:43:01.826 --> 00:43:04.734
put down a click,
and then it just draws the

00:43:04.734 --> 00:43:06.898
curve passing through that
point.

00:43:06.898 --> 00:43:09.265
Didn't we do this early in the
term?

00:43:09.265 --> 00:43:11.497
Yes.
But there is a difference now

00:43:11.497 --> 00:43:14.676
which I will explain.
These are various possible

00:43:14.676 --> 00:43:17.787
starting points at time zero for
this solution,

00:43:17.787 --> 00:43:20.898
and then you see what happens
to it afterwards.

00:43:20.898 --> 00:43:25.024
In fact, through every point in
the plane will pass a solution

00:43:25.024 --> 00:43:29.344
curve, parameterized curve.
Now, what is then the

00:43:29.344 --> 00:43:32.735
representation of this?
Well, what is the meaning of x

00:43:32.735 --> 00:43:36.000
prime of t and y prime of t?

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.500
I am not going to worry for the
moment about the right-hand

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:47.215
side.
What does this mean by itself?

00:43:47.215 --> 00:43:50.784
If this is the curve,
the parameterized motion,

00:43:50.784 --> 00:43:53.887
then this represents its
velocity vector.

00:43:53.887 --> 00:43:58.000
It is the velocity of the
solution at time t.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.002
If I think of the solution as
being a parameterized motion.

00:44:03.002 --> 00:44:08.005
All I have drawn here is the
trace, the path of the motion.

00:44:08.005 --> 00:44:11.714
This hasn't indicated how fast
it was going.

00:44:11.714 --> 00:44:16.630
One solution might go whoosh
and another one might go rah.

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:20.857
That is a velocity,
and that velocity changes from

00:44:20.857 --> 00:44:23.962
point to point.
It changes direction.

00:44:23.962 --> 00:44:27.498
Well, we know its direction at
each point.

00:44:27.498 --> 00:44:31.953
That's tangent.
What I cannot tell is the

00:44:31.953 --> 00:44:33.828
speed.
From this picture,

00:44:33.828 --> 00:44:36.328
I cannot tell what the speed
was.

00:44:36.328 --> 00:44:39.218
Too bad.
Now, what is then the meaning

00:44:39.218 --> 00:44:41.953
of the system?
What the system does,

00:44:41.953 --> 00:44:45.625
it prescribes at each point the
velocity vector.

00:44:45.625 --> 00:44:50.000
If you tell me what the point
(x, y) is in the plane then

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.531
these equations give you the
velocity vector at that point.

00:44:54.531 --> 00:44:57.187
And, therefore,
what I end up with,

00:44:57.187 --> 00:45:01.718
the system is what you call in
physics and what you call in

00:45:01.718 --> 00:45:06.788
18.02 a velocity field.
So at each point there is a

00:45:06.788 --> 00:45:09.835
certain vector.
The vector is always tangent to

00:45:09.835 --> 00:45:13.678
the solution curve through
there, but I cannot predict from

00:45:13.678 --> 00:45:17.388
just this picture what its
length will be because at some

00:45:17.388 --> 00:45:21.230
points, it might be going slow.
The solution might be going

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:22.687
slowly.
In other words,

00:45:22.687 --> 00:45:26.000
the plane is filled up with
these guys.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.208
Stop me.
Not enough here.

00:45:37.208 --> 00:45:44.924
So on and so on.
We can say a system of first

00:45:44.924 --> 00:45:52.990
order equations,
ODEs of first order equations,

00:45:52.990 --> 00:46:03.511
autonomous because there must
be no t on the right-hand side,

00:46:03.511 --> 00:46:12.919
is equal to a velocity field.
A field of velocity.

00:46:12.919 --> 00:46:18.613
The plane covered with velocity
vectors.

00:46:18.613 --> 00:46:25.474
And a solution is a
parameterized curve with the

00:46:25.474 --> 00:46:30.000
right velocity everywhere.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:47:39.620
Now, there obviously must be a
connection between that and the

00:47:39.620 --> 00:48:36.189
direction fields we studied at
the beginning of the term.

00:48:36.189 --> 00:49:11.545
And there is.
It is a very important

00:49:11.545 --> 00:49:49.932
connection.
It is too important to talk

00:49:49.932 --> 00:50:32.359
about in minus one minute.
When we need it,

00:50:32.359 --> 00:50:35.825
I will have to spend some time
talking about it then.
