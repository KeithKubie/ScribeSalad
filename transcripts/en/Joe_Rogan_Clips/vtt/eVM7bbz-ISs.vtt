1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.290
I got serious coyote problems.
I have,
I have no more chickens.

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.450
Really.
You're out of job.
All my chickens in one fell swoop.
You ready for this?

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.070
They killed the last nine chickens.
I had to transfer to them them cause my,

4
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.080
my um,
chicken coop burned to the ground.
So we had to get a smaller coop.

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.620
And you're blaming that on the co no,
no.
Um,
we,

6
00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:26.940
the chickens escaped and we saved the chickens and we got them to this other

7
00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:29.880
coop,
um,
after the fire.
And uh,

8
00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:33.390
it wasn't as reinforced as the original coupe,
the original coupe.

9
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:37.530
I had hired a guy who's a carpenter to build me a nice coupe and he did a great

10
00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:40.470
job and the coyotes were on the roof one night chewing at it.

11
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:44.340
And I had a fucking,
I had a,
a death perch set up on my porch.

12
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.420
I had my Hoyt out there.
I had arrows,
range finder.
I even had,

13
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.950
I even laid bait out in my yard waiting for these comments.
I was ready.

14
00:00:52.951 --> 00:00:56.820
I was Rambo,
but I lost my patients and I'm a busy man.

15
00:00:56.821 --> 00:01:00.810
I got a lot of things to do.
So I abandoned the project.
Fire came along,

16
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.750
fire burnt my fucking chicken coop down to the ground.
We put these uh,

17
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.800
chickens and another coop in these coyotes tour,

18
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.090
that coop part and they did it when we weren't home.
And uh,

19
00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:16.770
we came home was just feathers.
They were all gone.
All nine of them there,

20
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.290
you know,
part of me admires them,
you know,

21
00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:22.800
part of me is like these little wolves are surviving in the suburbs is trying to

22
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:25.040
figure this shit out.
Man.

23
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.870
They will break into this thing or die.

24
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.900
My wife was getting uncomfortable because you're basically making your house at

25
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:34.170
target.
You know,
they're on the roof right next to the house.

26
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:37.560
These little small predators are chewing at the roof of that.

27
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.710
The chicken coop before the fire happened and it was like,

28
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:42.840
oh that was the one I decided to go to war.

29
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.110
I didn't fully committed to war cause I didn't get a,

30
00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:48.840
I was going to get a subsonic 22.
That's the way to go.

31
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.670
Cause it you're here subtonic 22 it sounds like says pack pack doesn't sound

32
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:55.230
like anything but it's lethal.

33
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.760
I and a coyote but I don't think it's legal inside city limits.

34
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.900
Like I don't even think I should be saying that I wanted to shoot it.
No,
with a,

35
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.940
with a rifle,
it's probably like a,
like a criminal intent idea.

36
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:11.520
But I never really considered it and I definitely never bought one.

37
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.990
But I was ready to fuck one up with a bow and arrow.
But uh,
now it's over.

38
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.000
They got,
they won,
they figured it out,
the fire opened up the door and they,

39
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:24.540
um,
after the fire was they were real sketchy,

40
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.110
real loud and cause they were trying to figure out what the fuck is going on

41
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.750
because like all the,
the brush was gone.

42
00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:34.290
So probably the rabbits were missing and the rats are miss of course.
Yeah.

43
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.080
We're going to say Jamie.
Yeah,
it was a,
it's weird.
It came,
you know,

44
00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:43.470
came home and see just feathers everywhere man.
Just feathers.

45
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.330
Like just like someone just sliced a few pillows and just shook 'em all over the

46
00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:51.360
yard.
Like,
fuck,
you know.
