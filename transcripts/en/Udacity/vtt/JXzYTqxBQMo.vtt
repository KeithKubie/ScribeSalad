00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.790
The answer is that even though the same exact line of code was used to

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.200
generate the two different objects, they are themselves different objects.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.940
Changes you make to one object will not have any effect on

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.160
the other object because they have different identities.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.860
They are as different as two real world identical twins.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.410
Identical twins look the same, but certainly each one has its own identity.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.980
The two objects even start out by having all the same properties, but

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.720
no matter how similar they are in structure they will

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.970
always be two different objects their whole life.
