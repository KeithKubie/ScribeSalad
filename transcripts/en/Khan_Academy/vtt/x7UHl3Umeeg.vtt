00:00:00.062 --> 00:00:02.626
- [Voiceover] Two identical
spheres are released from

00:00:02.626 --> 00:00:06.725
a device at time equals
zero, from the same height H,

00:00:06.725 --> 00:00:09.267
as shown above, or T
equals zero I should say.

00:00:09.267 --> 00:00:12.239
Sphere A has no initial velocity
and falls straight down.

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:15.838
Sphere B is given an initial
horizontal velocity of

00:00:15.838 --> 00:00:19.739
magnitude V sub zero, and
travels a horizontal distance D

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:21.783
before it reaches the ground.

00:00:21.783 --> 00:00:26.148
The spheres reach the ground
at the same time T sub F,

00:00:26.148 --> 00:00:28.088
even though sphere B has more distance

00:00:28.088 --> 00:00:29.795
to cover before landing.

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:32.545
Air resistance is negligible.

00:00:32.545 --> 00:00:35.669
The dots below represent spheres A and B.

00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:39.209
Draw a free-body diagram
showing and labeling the forces,

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:42.088
not components, exerted on each sphere

00:00:42.088 --> 00:00:44.551
at time T sub F over two.

00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:46.129
So we can see our spheres here,

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.148
when I guess this little
this thing releases,

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:50.947
sphere A goes straight down.

00:00:50.947 --> 00:00:55.231
Sphere B, it it will
go, well it's vertical,

00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:57.669
and the vertical direction,
it'll go down just the same way.

00:00:57.669 --> 00:00:59.706
It'll be accelerated in just
the same way as sphere A,

00:00:59.706 --> 00:01:03.165
but it has some horizontal
velocity that makes it move out

00:01:03.165 --> 00:01:07.183
and hit the ground D to the right.

00:01:07.183 --> 00:01:09.865
And when it hits the
ground, that's T sub F.

00:01:09.865 --> 00:01:11.967
When they're up here, that's
right when they're released,

00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:16.111
it's T equals zero, and then
this is at T equals T sub F.

00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:20.849
And they say a free-body
diagram at T sub F over two.

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:24.912
So this is while both
of them are in flight.

00:01:24.912 --> 00:01:28.325
So while both of them are in flight,

00:01:28.325 --> 00:01:31.413
the only force acting on each of them,

00:01:31.413 --> 00:01:33.248
is just going to be the force of gravity.

00:01:33.248 --> 00:01:35.186
And since the spheres are identical,

00:01:35.186 --> 00:01:37.091
the force of that gravity
is going to be identical.

00:01:37.091 --> 00:01:41.072
They have the same mass, so let me draw.

00:01:41.072 --> 00:01:43.290
So that right over there
is the force of gravity

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.477
on sphere A, and that is
the force of gravity on

00:01:47.477 --> 00:01:49.452
sphere B.

00:01:49.452 --> 00:01:53.281
And so we could write, force of gravity,

00:01:53.281 --> 00:01:56.630
force of,

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.110
force of gravity.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.602
And if we want, we could,
we could say the magnitude

00:02:03.602 --> 00:02:06.981
is F sub G, if we want. F sub G.

00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:11.981
Or we could label it as M
times the gravitational field.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.761
So this is equal to,

00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:17.259
is equal to M times the
gravitational field.

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:19.441
And that's it, while they're mid flight,

00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:20.707
the only force acting on them,

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:22.785
we're assuming air
resistance is negligible,

00:02:22.785 --> 00:02:25.060
is the force of gravity's
going to be the same because

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.321
they have the same mass,
they're identical spheres.

00:02:28.321 --> 00:02:31.400
Alright, let's tackle
the next part of this.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.102
On the axes below,
sketch and label a graph

00:02:35.102 --> 00:02:39.318
of the horizontal components
of the velocity of sphere A

00:02:39.318 --> 00:02:42.335
and of sphere B as a function of time.

00:02:42.335 --> 00:02:43.659
Alright, I'll do sphere A first.

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.539
This is pretty straight forward.

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:49.440
Sphere A, if you will
remember, let's go up here.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.096
Sphere A has no horizontal
velocity the entire time

00:02:54.096 --> 00:02:55.561
we're talking about it, it only,

00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:58.113
it's only going to be accelerated
in the vertical direction.

00:02:58.113 --> 00:03:00.156
It's going to be accelerated downwards.

00:03:00.156 --> 00:03:03.547
So sphere A has no horizontal velocity,

00:03:03.547 --> 00:03:06.530
so I will draw a line like this.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.530
So sphere A has no horizontal
velocity the entire time.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.478
Now sphere, sphere B,

00:03:17.478 --> 00:03:20.498
sphere B is going to be

00:03:20.498 --> 00:03:23.660
a little bit more interesting,
slightly more interesting.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.027
It's velocity, they tell us,
that it's initial velocity is

00:03:27.027 --> 00:03:30.928
V sub zero, it's initial
horizontal velocity I should say,

00:03:30.928 --> 00:03:34.666
has a magnitude of V sub zero.

00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:37.023
And since air resistance is negligible,

00:03:37.023 --> 00:03:39.683
it's gonna continue going
to the right at V sub zero

00:03:39.683 --> 00:03:42.201
until it hits the ground.

00:03:42.201 --> 00:03:47.201
So, so sphere B, this is,

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.817
and I'm just gonna pick
one of these as V sub zero.

00:03:49.817 --> 00:03:53.602
Let's say that this right
over here is V sub zero.

00:03:53.602 --> 00:03:56.680
That's the magnitude of
it's horizontal velocity.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.324
Well sphere B is going
to be at that velocity,

00:04:00.324 --> 00:04:03.378
actually let me just make
it a little bit clearer.

00:04:03.378 --> 00:04:08.271
It's gonna be at that
velocity until, until V F.

00:04:08.271 --> 00:04:11.959
So if we say this right
over here, or not V F,

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.223
until the final time, until T F.

00:04:15.223 --> 00:04:16.860
So this is T equals zero to T F.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.636
The entire time while the ball's in the,

00:04:18.636 --> 00:04:20.787
while that sphere is in the air,

00:04:20.787 --> 00:04:22.981
it's going to have the
horizontal component

00:04:22.981 --> 00:04:25.605
of its velocity is just
going to be constant.

00:04:25.605 --> 00:04:26.928
It's not going to be
slowed down by anything

00:04:26.928 --> 00:04:28.960
because we're assuming air
resistance is negligible.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.085
And then right when it hits the ground,

00:04:31.085 --> 00:04:32.629
it essentially, if you
think about the force

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:35.288
that is stopping it is
essentially friction,

00:04:35.288 --> 00:04:40.288
but then it very quickly
goes down to a velocity of a

00:04:41.161 --> 00:04:42.938
a magnitude of velocity,

00:04:42.938 --> 00:04:46.606
of horizontal magnitude velocity of zero.

00:04:46.606 --> 00:04:51.606
Alright, alright now let's
tackle the last part of this.

00:04:52.263 --> 00:04:53.947
Now you could label this if you want,

00:04:53.947 --> 00:04:56.037
this is, let me actually let me label it,

00:04:56.037 --> 00:05:01.037
this is B, sphere B, and this is sphere,

00:05:01.842 --> 00:05:04.663
that is sphere A right over there.

00:05:04.663 --> 00:05:06.439
In sphere B if you want, you could show,

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:08.297
it would overwrite sphere A, so your B

00:05:08.297 --> 00:05:09.760
would be zero after that.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.987
It's not continuing to
move on to the right,

00:05:12.987 --> 00:05:15.509
or at least they don't tell
us anything about, about that.

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:19.190
Finally, in a clear, coherent, paragl

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.153
(laughs)

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:23.229
clear, coherent,
paragraph-length response,

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:26.585
explain why the spheres reach
the ground at the same time

00:05:26.585 --> 00:05:29.568
even though they travel
different distances.

00:05:29.568 --> 00:05:34.568
Include references in your
answers to parts A and B.

00:05:34.747 --> 00:05:36.128
Alright, so let me think about it.

00:05:36.128 --> 00:05:37.475
I'll try to write a clear, coherent,

00:05:37.475 --> 00:05:39.936
paragraph-length response.

00:05:39.936 --> 00:05:44.936
So I'll say, the entire time the,

00:05:45.113 --> 00:05:46.951
or let me say from,

00:05:46.951 --> 00:05:51.395
from T equals zero...

00:05:51.395 --> 00:05:55.045
to T equals T sub F,

00:05:55.045 --> 00:05:58.665
the only force

00:06:00.603 --> 00:06:05.601
acting on the spheres

00:06:08.695 --> 00:06:11.744
is the downward force of gravity.

00:06:11.744 --> 00:06:16.744
Is the downward force,

00:06:18.723 --> 00:06:23.723
force of (mumbles) of gravity.

00:06:25.143 --> 00:06:28.545
At T equals zero,

00:06:28.545 --> 00:06:32.484
at T equals zero, they both,

00:06:32.484 --> 00:06:37.484
they both have zero vertical velocity or

00:06:38.262 --> 00:06:41.385
the magnitude of the velocity
in the vertical direction

00:06:41.385 --> 00:06:42.605
is zero for both of em.

00:06:42.605 --> 00:06:44.311
Let me write it that way.

00:06:44.311 --> 00:06:49.140
The, the magnitude

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.879
of both of their velocities,

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:58.879
both of their velocities,

00:07:01.322 --> 00:07:05.245
velocities,

00:07:05.245 --> 00:07:09.613
in the vertical

00:07:09.613 --> 00:07:11.733
direction

00:07:11.733 --> 00:07:15.033
(writes sentence)

00:07:15.033 --> 00:07:17.563
is zero.

00:07:17.563 --> 00:07:22.563
After T equals zero,

00:07:22.855 --> 00:07:25.795
they are accelerated,

00:07:25.795 --> 00:07:28.484
they are accelerated at the same rate.

00:07:28.484 --> 00:07:31.598
Accelerated

00:07:31.598 --> 00:07:33.098
(writing)

00:07:33.098 --> 00:07:36.778
at the same,

00:07:36.778 --> 00:07:40.856
they're accelerated at the same rate.

00:07:40.856 --> 00:07:43.967
so their vertical component of velocity,

00:07:43.967 --> 00:07:45.207
their vertical

00:07:45.207 --> 00:07:48.037
(writing)

00:07:48.037 --> 00:07:53.037
component, components of velocity,

00:07:53.567 --> 00:07:55.507
velocity are always the same.

00:07:55.507 --> 00:08:00.283
Of velocity are always

00:08:00.283 --> 00:08:02.423
(writing)

00:08:02.423 --> 00:08:03.893
the same.

00:08:03.893 --> 00:08:06.792
And they have the same
vertical distance to cover,

00:08:06.792 --> 00:08:11.618
and they have the same,

00:08:11.618 --> 00:08:15.028
(writing)

00:08:15.028 --> 00:08:17.518
the same vertical distance to cover.

00:08:19.598 --> 00:08:24.258
Vertical distance to cover.

00:08:25.948 --> 00:08:28.653
So they hit the ground at the same time.

00:08:28.653 --> 00:08:29.814
Let me make sure that makes sense.

00:08:29.814 --> 00:08:32.414
After T equals zero, they are
accelerated at the same rate,

00:08:32.414 --> 00:08:34.411
so their vertical
components of velocity are

00:08:34.411 --> 00:08:36.675
always the same.

00:08:36.675 --> 00:08:40.808
Let me, actually let me,
let me write this this way.

00:08:40.808 --> 00:08:45.808
Since they have the same, since,

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:48.484
actually let me,

00:08:48.484 --> 00:08:53.484
since they have the same

00:08:57.152 --> 00:08:59.132
vertical distance to cover,

00:08:59.132 --> 00:09:03.659
vertical distance to cover,

00:09:03.659 --> 00:09:06.019
(writing)

00:09:06.019 --> 00:09:08.941
they will hit the ground at the same time.

00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:13.401
They will hit the ground

00:09:13.401 --> 00:09:15.631
(writes sentence)

00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:19.061
at the same time.

00:09:19.901 --> 00:09:21.451
Same time.

00:09:22.731 --> 00:09:25.546
They do have different
horizontal velocities,

00:09:25.546 --> 00:09:29.387
but that does not affect their,
that does effect the time

00:09:29.387 --> 00:09:34.387
their velocities or the distance
in the vertical direction.

00:09:35.774 --> 00:09:40.613
They have different horizontal,

00:09:40.613 --> 00:09:44.953
(writes sentence)

00:09:44.953 --> 00:09:48.183
horizontal velocities,

00:09:50.263 --> 00:09:53.739
but that

00:09:53.739 --> 00:09:55.159
(writes sentence)

00:09:55.159 --> 00:09:59.039
does not effect

00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:01.339
the time in which they,

00:10:01.339 --> 00:10:02.756
they cover the same vertical distance,

00:10:02.756 --> 00:10:07.473
effect the time in which

00:10:07.473 --> 00:10:10.143
(writes sentence)

00:10:10.143 --> 00:10:15.143
they cover the same

00:10:16.333 --> 00:10:19.694
vertical distance.

00:10:19.694 --> 00:10:22.793
And you could write
something to that effect,

00:10:22.793 --> 00:10:26.056
and you could also write
that yes, if you were to add

00:10:26.056 --> 00:10:28.818
the components of spheres Bs velocities,

00:10:28.818 --> 00:10:31.257
it would actually have a larger velocity

00:10:31.257 --> 00:10:32.395
if you were to add the components.

00:10:32.395 --> 00:10:33.579
If you're not thinking you needed

00:10:33.579 --> 00:10:34.554
the horizontal or the vertical direction,

00:10:34.554 --> 00:10:38.814
and so it does indeed cover
more distance and space

00:10:38.814 --> 00:10:40.197
over the same amount of time.

00:10:40.197 --> 00:10:42.471
But if you think about it just
in the vertical direction,

00:10:42.471 --> 00:10:44.655
it's covering the same
distance, in the same time,

00:10:44.655 --> 00:10:46.872
at any given point in time
in the vertical direction.

00:10:46.872 --> 00:10:48.218
It actually has the same velocity

00:10:48.218 --> 00:10:50.379
It's being accelerated in the same way

00:10:50.379 --> 00:10:55.301
that starts off at, of
magnitude of velocity of zero.
