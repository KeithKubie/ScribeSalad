00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680
conversation was to start with some
 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.770
conversation was to start with some
building blocks of competitiveness that

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780
building blocks of competitiveness that
 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.619
building blocks of competitiveness that
I've been discussing and and studying

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629
I've been discussing and and studying
 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.300
I've been discussing and and studying
over the last several weeks and

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310
over the last several weeks and
 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.619
over the last several weeks and
certainly during the course of this

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629
certainly during the course of this
 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:12.920
certainly during the course of this
campaign everybody right now is thinking

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930
campaign everybody right now is thinking
 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.399
campaign everybody right now is thinking
about gas prices everybody is concerned

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:15.409
about gas prices everybody is concerned
 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.360
about gas prices everybody is concerned
about not only the impact on individual

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370
about not only the impact on individual
 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.360
about not only the impact on individual
pocketbooks but also the overall impact

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370
pocketbooks but also the overall impact
 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.339
pocketbooks but also the overall impact
on our economy and our environment so I

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349
on our economy and our environment so I
 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.450
on our economy and our environment so I
thought that that would be a good place

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460
thought that that would be a good place
 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.999
thought that that would be a good place
to start it strikes me that if we don't

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009
to start it strikes me that if we don't
 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.080
to start it strikes me that if we don't
get our energy policy right that it is

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090
get our energy policy right that it is
 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.340
get our energy policy right that it is
going to be very difficult for us to

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350
going to be very difficult for us to
 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.339
going to be very difficult for us to
maintain our competitiveness and our

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:38.349
maintain our competitiveness and our
 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:41.820
maintain our competitiveness and our
long long term standard of living and so

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830
long long term standard of living and so
 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.309
long long term standard of living and so
I thought I'd start with you records you

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:44.319
I thought I'd start with you records you
 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:47.969
I thought I'd start with you records you
make cars and trucks and obviously

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.409
make cars and trucks and obviously
you've been impacted profoundly by the

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419
you've been impacted profoundly by the

during the course of this campaign I

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370
during the course of this campaign I
 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.689
during the course of this campaign I
visited the plant in janesville and

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699
visited the plant in janesville and
 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.990

choice the workers there are obviously

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620
choice the workers there are obviously
 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.450
choice the workers there are obviously
in a extraordinarily difficult spot the

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460
in a extraordinarily difficult spot the
 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.230
in a extraordinarily difficult spot the
question I guess is how how do we shape

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240
question I guess is how how do we shape
 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.089

that will continue to use oil for a long
 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.340
that will continue to use oil for a long
time but a very importantly alternatives

different kind of energy source and then
 

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.189
different kind of energy source and then
beyond that we're very optimistic about

00:07:56.189 --> 00:07:56.199
beyond that we're very optimistic about
 

00:07:56.199 --> 00:07:57.839

so we have we have some work to do there

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:22.910
so we have we have some work to do there
 

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:23.740
so we have we have some work to do there
but we've got a lot of smart people

working on it in the US so that would be
very important I think the second thing

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:27.980
very important I think the second thing
 

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.740
very important I think the second thing
to keep in mind is the application of

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:29.750
to keep in mind is the application of
 

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.450
to keep in mind is the application of

phase is pretty expensive right and so

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:33.230
phase is pretty expensive right and so
 

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:35.200
phase is pretty expensive right and so
we do have incentives for consumers as

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:35.210
we do have incentives for consumers as
 

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:36.910
we do have incentives for consumers as
you know to buy hybrids and I think

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:36.920
you know to buy hybrids and I think
 

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.560
you know to buy hybrids and I think
we're going to need to provide some

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:38.570
we're going to need to provide some
 

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.030
we're going to need to provide some
support for me to make these new

ourselves of that of that of that weight
in that influence and we can do that

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:16.790
in that influence and we can do that
 

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:19.150
in that influence and we can do that
through diversity and you've heard some

through diversity and you've heard some
 

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.560
through diversity and you've heard some
of that already you'll hear more later

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:20.570
of that already you'll hear more later
 

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:23.049
of that already you'll hear more later
you can do it through efficiency you can

00:27:23.049 --> 00:27:23.059
you can do it through efficiency you can
 

00:27:23.059 --> 00:27:25.270
you can do it through efficiency you can
do it through affordability because that

that we are trying to go somewhere we
 

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:01.550
that we are trying to go somewhere we
have never been before and that is

in our country but across this plant the
 

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:14.780
in our country but across this plant the

planet and I think that it requires us
 

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:16.310
planet and I think that it requires us
to think about what we do in public

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:16.320
to think about what we do in public
 

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:18.950

we bring all children to high levels of
knowledge and skill our challenge is

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:55.650
knowledge and skill our challenge is
 

00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:58.280
knowledge and skill our challenge is
taking that to scale so that it happens

00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:58.290
taking that to scale so that it happens
 

00:41:58.290 --> 00:42:00.980
taking that to scale so that it happens
in every classroom in our state in my

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:00.990
in every classroom in our state in my
 

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:03.200
in every classroom in our state in my
state every classroom in this country

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:03.210
state every classroom in this country
 

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:06.140
state every classroom in this country
and thinking about how we then create a

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:06.150
and thinking about how we then create a
 

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:08.930
and thinking about how we then create a
system that better enables us to take

00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:08.940
system that better enables us to take
 

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:12.230
system that better enables us to take
that work to scale and as we peel back

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240
that work to scale and as we peel back
 

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.450
that work to scale and as we peel back
all of the various levels of challenges

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:14.460
all of the various levels of challenges
 

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:16.820
all of the various levels of challenges
that we have in public education I think

that we have in public education I think
 

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:19.610
that we have in public education I think
we get back to the heart of what school

00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:19.620
we get back to the heart of what school
 

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:21.590
we get back to the heart of what school
is all about the teaching and the

learning and helping to support our
teachers to have a knowledge and skill

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:27.930
teachers to have a knowledge and skill
 

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:30.350
teachers to have a knowledge and skill
to address all of the many challenges

between the costs of people being
healthier because there is let's say a

strategically so the idea is to look at

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:01.960
strategically so the idea is to look at
 

01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:05.210
strategically so the idea is to look at
the country as a whole and identify the

01:27:05.210 --> 01:27:05.220
the country as a whole and identify the
 

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:09.140
the country as a whole and identify the
major roadblocks gridlocks and problems

01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:09.150
major roadblocks gridlocks and problems
 

01:27:09.150 --> 01:27:11.990
major roadblocks gridlocks and problems
and most of those frankly are in the

01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:12.000
and most of those frankly are in the
 

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.550
and most of those frankly are in the
metropolitan communities of our country

01:27:13.550 --> 01:27:13.560
metropolitan communities of our country
 

01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:16.310

if you look at where most delays occur

01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320
if you look at where most delays occur
 

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:18.590
if you look at where most delays occur
it's in our metro areas but that's also

01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:18.600
it's in our metro areas but that's also
 

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:20.390
it's in our metro areas but that's also
where most of the jobs are and where

01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400
where most of the jobs are and where

to have a strategic investment set of
criteria that say let's look at these

01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960
criteria that say let's look at these
 

01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:33.830
criteria that say let's look at these
major roadblocks problems in the country

major roadblocks problems in the country
 

01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:36.500
major roadblocks problems in the country
let's invest in those let's fix those so

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:36.510
let's invest in those let's fix those so
 

01:27:36.510 --> 01:27:38.780
let's invest in those let's fix those so
that our gridlock our transportation

01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:38.790
that our gridlock our transportation
 

01:27:38.790 --> 01:27:41.690
that our gridlock our transportation
system works better and lastly we've got

by our competitors I think what's

by our competitors I think what's
 

01:29:13.950 --> 01:29:15.500
by our competitors I think what's
interesting is this issue of

interesting is this issue of
 

01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:18.170
interesting is this issue of

earlier environmental sustainability and
 

01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:27.940
earlier environmental sustainability and
of course the whole issue of social

01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:27.950
of course the whole issue of social
 

01:29:27.950 --> 01:29:30.770
of course the whole issue of social

like some of these other issues that
 

01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:40.670

been talking about would be a powerful
 

01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:53.060
been talking about would be a powerful
new tool and perhaps more important than
