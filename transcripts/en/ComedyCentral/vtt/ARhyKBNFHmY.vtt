00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:12.880
Oh, good morning, Mr. Blake,
I'm Amy, your new secretary.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.581
Hello, Amy,
good to meet you.

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.283
Say, I'm very busy today
so I'd like you to make sure

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.885
that I'm not disturbed.

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:19.586
No one, but no one,
is to go into my office

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.687
without an appointment,
got it?

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:23.156
Yes, sir.
Thanks, doll.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.264
I need to see
Mr. Blake immediately!
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:32.065
He's busy right now.
Well, this can't wait.

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:33.700
No, no, you can't
go in there!

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:35.669
(man)
Blake! Completely
unacceptable.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:37.271
Third time this month!

00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:39.206
I'm sorry, Mr. Blake, I told
him he can't come in here!

00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:41.141
All right, Amy,
have a seat, Bill.

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:44.678
For the love of God.

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:47.381
This is--

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:57.658
Damn it, Amy, what
happened there?
I'm sorry, sir.

00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:59.826
I told him he
couldn't go in there.
Okay.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.595
Well, I really need you to put
some oomph into it, kiddo.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:04.731
Okay.
All right.

00:01:07.868 --> 00:01:09.603
This is an abomination,
I need to see Mr. Blake.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.205
No, you can't go
in there!

00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:14.074
The hell I can't.

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:15.943
Blake, I've had
it up to here!

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.245
I'm sorry, Mr. Blake, I told
he can't come in here!

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:20.547
(Mr. Blake)
Jesus Christ, Amy.

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:22.282
Ed, did she say you
couldn't come in here?

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:24.084
Yes, she did.
Well, how did
she say it?

00:01:24.218 --> 00:01:26.119
Uh, "You can't go
in there."

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:28.088
Okay, that's
pretty good.

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:30.557
But the way she said it, it
felt like I could go in there.

00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:32.125
(Mr. Blake)
Mm-hmm.

00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:34.528
Amy, there are thousands
of women who'd kill for the

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:36.630
opportunity to tell people they
can't come into my office.

00:01:36.697 --> 00:01:38.665
I know, I'm sorry, sir,
I'll work on it.

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:42.102
Mm-hmm, all right,
have a seat, Ed.

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:49.977
You can't go in there,
you can't go in there.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.144
You can't go in there.

00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:52.346
I have to see Mr. Blake!

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:53.814
No, no, you
can't go in there!

00:01:53.914 --> 00:01:55.148
Oh.

00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:57.217
Okay, thank you.

00:01:57.317 --> 00:02:00.053
I'll wait.

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:01.722
Oh.

00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:03.624
Well, I'm sorry I yelled,
I have to say that.

00:02:03.757 --> 00:02:06.627
No, I respect the
American secretary.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.695
I'm not an animal.

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:10.297
Sir, thank you.

00:02:10.397 --> 00:02:12.499
Today's been so
difficult for me and--

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:14.168
Say! Is someone
going in there?

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:16.537
Where?
Come on, everyone!

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:17.804
What? No!

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.239
No, you can't
go in there!

00:02:19.373 --> 00:02:20.741
You can't go in there!
You can't go in there!

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.176
You, you can't
go in there!

00:02:22.276 --> 00:02:23.177
You can't go in there!
You can't go in there!

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:24.811
You can't go
in there!

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:26.513
You can't-- Oh, gosh,
I'm dreadful at this.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.581
(Mr. Blake)
How did you guys
get in here?

00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:30.083
Amy!

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:36.190
Look, Amy, you're a woman
and you can only focus

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.525
on one thing at
a time, I get that.

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.093
That's why I gave you
just the one task.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.095
In fact, what are
you even doing typing?

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:44.598
Look, you need to start doing
your job or I'm going to find

00:02:44.698 --> 00:02:46.200
someone who can
do your job.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.769
(sputters)

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:54.875
Well, hello, I'm here
to see Mr. Blake.

00:02:54.975 --> 00:03:00.247
You can't go in there!

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.217
Oh!

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.286
Ooh! Ow!

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:08.922
Oh!

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.138
<i>(woman)
I'm sorry, your call cannot
be completed as dialed.</i>

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:28.642
You! Can't!
Go! In! There!

<i>(Mr. Blake)
Amy.</i>

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.213
<i>Did my 11:30
get here yet?</i>

00:03:36.884 --> 00:03:39.553
Mr. Blake will
see you now.
