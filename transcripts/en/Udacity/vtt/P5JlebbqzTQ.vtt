Hi, I'm Cameron Pitman, and welcome to the class on AJAX requests.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.570
Let's imagine that you want to visit a website.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.760
When you type in the name of the website into your browser and

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.780
press Enter, what do you expect to happen?

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.560
The exact answer, of course, depends on the website.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.530
But it's safe to say that you expect to see,

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.160
well, something, some website, to show up very quickly.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.790
And have you noticed how

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.220
the next page button has mostly disappeared from the Internet?

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.160
Modern websites can load content without reloading.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.180
Developers have solved the challenge of loading information quickly and

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.750
after the first page render in many ways.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.297
And one flexible and popular implementation relies on AJAX requests,

00:00:37.297 --> 00:00:39.971
which allow for data to be received asynchronously.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.950
Data that loads asynchronously can be requested late in the load process and

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.350
the website should load acceptably with or without it.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.520
As part of this class, you'll be building a move planner app.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.200
You know what?

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.850
Let's take a look at it.
