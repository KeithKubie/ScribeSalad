00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:01.548
- [Voiceover] What I wanna do in this video is give

00:00:01.548 --> 00:00:06.298
an overview of the endomembrane system in eukaryotic cells.

00:00:06.298 --> 00:00:10.688
Endomembrane system.

00:00:10.688 --> 00:00:13.938
And at a very high level, the endomembrane system is all

00:00:13.938 --> 00:00:17.770
of the membranes that interact with each other

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.976
inside of a cell.

00:00:18.976 --> 00:00:20.950
So what membranes are we talking about?

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.505
Well, you can start off by talking

00:00:22.505 --> 00:00:25.223
about the cell membrane itself.

00:00:25.223 --> 00:00:26.593
And all of these membranes,

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:29.148
these have bilayers of phospholipids.

00:00:29.148 --> 00:00:30.494
Sometimes my brain malfunctions

00:00:30.494 --> 00:00:32.073
and I call them bilipid layers,

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:34.952
but these are bilayers of phospholipids.

00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:37.645
So if I were to zoom in right over here,

00:00:37.645 --> 00:00:40.385
if I were to zoom in right over there, that line,

00:00:40.385 --> 00:00:45.122
it really is a bilayer of phospholipids,

00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:46.980
so it would look like this.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.849
So you have your...

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:53.039
hydrophilic heads pointing ouwards,

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.080
and your hydrophobic tails pointing inwards.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.030
So hydrophilic heads pointing outwards,

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.282
hydrophobic tails pointing inwards,

00:01:01.282 --> 00:01:02.351
and it keeps going.

00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:05.600
If we think of it from left to right,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.595
you have a layer of two,

00:01:07.595 --> 00:01:10.775
or you have a bilayer, I should say, of phospholipids.

00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:12.706
That's going to be true of the cellular membrane,

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:13.857
that's going to be true

00:01:13.857 --> 00:01:16.947
of the outer nuclear membrane right over here.

00:01:16.947 --> 00:01:20.972
We drew this one on the video on the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:01:20.972 --> 00:01:23.271
And so over here you see these two membranes.

00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:25.732
You might say, "OK, is this a bilayer?"

00:01:25.732 --> 00:01:27.869
No, this is actually two bilayers.

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.398
So this membrane right over here has a phospholipid bilayer,

00:01:31.398 --> 00:01:35.792
and this membrane over here also has a phospholipid...

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:38.732
a phosopholipid bilayer.

00:01:40.112 --> 00:01:41.260
Let me do this in another color.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.375
This one that I'm starting to trace in magenta,

00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:48.835
that's the outer membrane of the nuclear envelope,

00:01:48.835 --> 00:01:52.040
and it's continuous with the membrane

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.733
of the endoplasmic reticulum,

00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:57.241
which I'm starting to highlight right over here.

00:01:57.241 --> 00:01:59.107
And then the one that I'm highlighting

00:01:59.107 --> 00:02:01.487
in this purple color,

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:05.577
this is the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope,

00:02:05.577 --> 00:02:09.083
and all of this is part of the endomembrane system.

00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:10.638
I've already started talking

00:02:10.638 --> 00:02:12.170
about the endoplasmic reticulum,

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.330
and we go into some depth on that on the video

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.903
on the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus,

00:02:18.903 --> 00:02:21.505
but it's also part of the endomembrane system.

00:02:21.505 --> 00:02:24.965
And the endoplasmic reticulum in particular can represent

00:02:24.965 --> 00:02:27.440
up to, or even more than, 50%...

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.231
of the phospholipid membrane associated with the cell.

00:02:33.231 --> 00:02:35.181
And we've talked about what goes on

00:02:35.181 --> 00:02:37.689
in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:39.916
So this area right over here...

00:02:42.206 --> 00:02:43.678
we've talked about what happens there.

00:02:43.678 --> 00:02:45.792
Proteins can get synthesized.

00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:48.137
Actually, other molecules, like lipids,

00:02:48.137 --> 00:02:49.732
can get synthesized there.

00:02:51.032 --> 00:02:53.733
And then they can go to the smooth ER,

00:02:53.733 --> 00:02:56.125
and then the place where they exit from the smooth ER,

00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:58.841
and we saw that in the video on the endoplasmic reticulum,

00:02:58.841 --> 00:03:00.466
how they can kind of butt out.

00:03:00.466 --> 00:03:04.065
We call this area, it's often called the transitional ER.

00:03:04.065 --> 00:03:06.689
So this area right over here,

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.985
we would call the transitional endoplasmic reticulum.

00:03:09.985 --> 00:03:11.290
Transitional...

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.088
transitional ER is this place

00:03:19.088 --> 00:03:21.758
where these proteins are being butted off,

00:03:21.758 --> 00:03:23.407
and they're butting off in vesicles.

00:03:23.407 --> 00:03:25.915
So this is the transitional ER.

00:03:25.915 --> 00:03:28.585
And all vesicles are are little small compartments

00:03:28.585 --> 00:03:30.280
that have a membrane around it,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.623
that things like a protein can be transported in.

00:03:33.623 --> 00:03:35.597
And I don't wanna beat a dead horse here,

00:03:35.597 --> 00:03:37.292
but all of these lines that I'm drawing,

00:03:37.292 --> 00:03:38.917
even though I drew it as a single line,

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:41.611
these are phospholipid bilayers.

00:03:41.611 --> 00:03:42.981
So the membrane might be different,

00:03:42.981 --> 00:03:45.001
the phospholipid bilayers might be different

00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:47.996
when we go from one piece of the membrane to another,

00:03:47.996 --> 00:03:50.457
but they all have that same general notion

00:03:50.457 --> 00:03:53.661
of having this bilayer of phospholipids.

00:03:53.661 --> 00:03:55.287
But just as a review, these proteins,

00:03:55.287 --> 00:03:58.932
they can emerge from the transitional ER,

00:03:58.932 --> 00:04:01.463
they can make their way to the Golgi apparatus.

00:04:01.463 --> 00:04:02.879
And we've already talked about how

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.896
in the Golgi apparatus these proteins can be matured.

00:04:06.896 --> 00:04:08.173
And when I say being matured,

00:04:08.173 --> 00:04:10.379
there's a bunch of enzymes in here,

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.329
there's a bunch of Golgi enzymes in here,

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.489
they can do all sorts of things to the proteins:

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.727
tag them, they can actually add...

00:04:18.167 --> 00:04:19.747
add saccharides to them,

00:04:19.747 --> 00:04:21.849
so that they become glycoproteins.

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:23.683
They can tag them so they can be used

00:04:23.683 --> 00:04:25.169
in the cellular membrane,

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.027
or be used outside of the cellular membrane,

00:04:27.027 --> 00:04:29.233
or to be used other places in the cell.

00:04:29.233 --> 00:04:32.483
So for example, this protein right over here butted off

00:04:32.483 --> 00:04:37.150
as a vesicle, it makes its way to the Golgi apparatus,

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.660
the membrane can then merge,

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.259
and then dump the protein into the Golgi apparatus.

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.232
From there it can be matured.

00:04:44.232 --> 00:04:46.252
It might turn into a glycoprotein,

00:04:46.252 --> 00:04:47.669
who knows what happens to it?

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.364
And then it could butt off again,

00:04:49.364 --> 00:04:51.523
and then this protein that's now butted off,

00:04:51.523 --> 00:04:56.028
it could go to be embedded into the cellular membrane.

00:04:56.028 --> 00:04:59.000
The protein could be excreted from the cell,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.600
or it could go to other parts of the cell.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.273
Everything I've just talked about,

00:05:03.273 --> 00:05:05.640
those aren't the only parts of the endomembrane system.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.869
You have things like vacuoles,

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:11.445
which are membrane-bound organelles in a cell.

00:05:11.445 --> 00:05:15.671
In plant cells, a vacuole can be used for storage,

00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:17.807
it could be used for structure.

00:05:17.807 --> 00:05:19.293
Vacuoles can get quite large,

00:05:19.293 --> 00:05:20.454
and they can actually give, kind of,

00:05:20.454 --> 00:05:22.962
the structure of the actual plant.

00:05:22.962 --> 00:05:27.304
In animal cells, you might have something called a lysosome.

00:05:27.304 --> 00:05:29.370
And a lysosome is a membrane-bound structure

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.110
where, essentially, things go to, for the most part,

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.639
be recycled, or to be torn apart.

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.943
So maybe something got packaged from someplace.

00:05:40.903 --> 00:05:42.272
Let me do this in another color.

00:05:43.192 --> 00:05:45.925
And I drew that vesicle a little bit too big.

00:05:45.925 --> 00:05:47.736
But maybe this stuff, it needs to be destroyed,

00:05:47.736 --> 00:05:51.730
so this membrane, it can then merge with that membrane

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.143
and dump its contents in here,

00:05:55.143 --> 00:05:58.649
and this has a low pH, and it can actually, kind of,

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:01.272
break apart this stuff, and it can digest this stuff,

00:06:01.272 --> 00:06:04.755
and recycle it into its, I guess you could say,

00:06:04.755 --> 00:06:06.451
more constituent material.

00:06:06.451 --> 00:06:11.187
So all of this is part of the endomembrane system.

00:06:11.187 --> 00:06:12.790
So once again, I don't think there's an appreciation

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:13.997
for how complex

00:06:13.997 --> 00:06:17.433
and, on a lot of levels, beautiful cells can be.
