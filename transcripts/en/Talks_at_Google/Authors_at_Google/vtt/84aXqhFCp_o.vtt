MALE SPEAKER: It is
my sincere pleasure

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.061
to introduce Seth Casteel.

00:00:07.061 --> 00:00:09.060
As I told him, I think
his title on the internet

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.720
goes as award winning
photographer and New York

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.240
Times best selling author.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.680
So that's what I chose
to introduce him as.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.060
But in all serious, Seth's
work is extremely well-known.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.120
I think we've all seen it a lot,
books, magazines, newspapers,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.040
everywhere.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.740
And he's just coming out with a
new book, "Underwater Puppies,"

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.104
so no better time
to hear from him.

00:00:31.104 --> 00:00:32.479
So without further
ado, I'm going

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.440
to let him tell you
guys about all of this.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.729
Thank you.

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:38.520
SETH CASTEEL: Thank
you for the nice intro.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.920
Well--

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.320
SETH CASTEEL:
--thanks, everybody

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.590
for having me come
out here today.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.245
First time I've ever been
to the Google campus.

00:00:43.245 --> 00:00:44.630
I'm real excited about it.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.990
I had lunch over here,
met some really cool dogs.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.600
I'm real happy to learn
that, obviously, lots

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.140
of dog people here, and lots
of dogs on campus and coming

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.960
to work.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.160
I mean, I had that kind of
job too, so that's cool.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.590
But it's always nice to
meet other folks that

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.760
could bring dogs to work,
so pretty cool deal.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.510
So my name's Seth.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.340
This is my latest project,
"Underwater Puppies."

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.802
this is important
for a lot of reasons.

00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:11.510
We're going to get
into that in a minute.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.360
But first I want
to talk about cats.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.710
So a little bit about
me-- I'll probably

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.840
speak for about-- I don't
know-- I want to say 30 minutes.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.660
If I see people sneaking
out or yawning or throwing

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.590
things at me, I
might shorten it.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.760
But sometimes if you give
me a microphone, even

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.301
this microphone,
I'll have a tendency

00:01:29.301 --> 00:01:30.480
to ramble on a little bit.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.470
Also, while I'm
speaking, if you guys

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.209
have any questions
about anything--

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:36.500
it could be relevant or not--
feel free raise your hand

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.220
and ask me.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.064
And I'll do my best to
answer your question.

00:01:40.064 --> 00:01:41.480
How many dog people
are out there?

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.226
How many people like dogs?

00:01:43.226 --> 00:01:43.965
Oh, good.

00:01:43.965 --> 00:01:44.880
Because if you didn't
raise your hand,

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.213
I was going to ask you to leave.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.130
How many people have dogs?

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.570
Oh, quite a few-- terrific.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.014
Any good swimming
dogs out there?

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:55.930
Who has swimming dogs?

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.846
Cool, we'll talk later.

00:01:57.846 --> 00:02:00.450
So I'm originally from
the state of Illinois.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.220
I moved out to California to
go to film school in 1999.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.290
I went to film school.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.498
I thought I was going to be
a movie director or movie

00:02:08.498 --> 00:02:09.750
producer, that kind of thing.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.380
I got a job at Sony Pictures
Entertainment right out

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.500
of film school working
as an assistant

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.610
and then working in finance.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.460
Having no experience in finance,
I found myself in a position

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.952
with some responsibility.

00:02:20.952 --> 00:02:23.410
And then people always wonder,
jeez, what happened to Sony,

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.855
you know?

00:02:24.855 --> 00:02:26.160
Maybe they hired people.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.618
I can't believe that I'm saying
this and we're taping this,

00:02:28.618 --> 00:02:30.720
but that's OK.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.760
I'll also try not to
swear, because this

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.250
is going to be on the
internet someplace.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.480
But anyways, I worked in finance
and somehow made the transition

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.060
over to advertising
for Columbia Pictures.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.470
So I was working on advertising
campaigns for all Columbia's

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.440
big films, "Spiderman," "Angels
and Demons," The Da Vinci

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.480
Code," two James Bond films,
"Casino Royale," "Quantum

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.220
of Solace," and dozens
of other movies-- really,

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.310
really, fun job.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.350
And because I worked at
Sony, I met these baby cats.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.300
This is how it all began
for me back in 2007.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.490
I had a friend who
will remain anonymous,

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.780
because maybe she'll see this.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.240
But she'll know who she is.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.780
Her name is blank,
a wonderful lady.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.780
And she is an animal
welfare person.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.075
She cares about animals more
than she cares about people.

00:03:18.075 --> 00:03:19.450
And she is the
person that you go

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.380
to when you find a cat
that needs some help.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.070
She won't tell you no.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.980
Her heart is definitely bigger
than the logic of her mind.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.342
And I applaud her for
that-- really sweet lady.

00:03:31.342 --> 00:03:32.550
And I'll give you an example.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.080
At one point when I
first met-- she was also

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.470
working at Sony with me--
she had about five cats.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.110
And then time went by.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.960
And then she had about 60 cats.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.880
And I said, you know, hey, I
don't know a lot about cats.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.820
But I feel like that's at
least five too many cats.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.580
So anyway, she and
some of her friends

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.390
were taking care of
this cat colony living

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.290
on the Sony Pictures lot.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.290
And they basically
just lived on the lot.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.710
They would make sure the
cats were fed, taken care of.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.250
I they had any new
additions to the cat colony,

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.402
they would trap the cats.

00:04:05.402 --> 00:04:07.860
They would spay or neuter and
put them back into the studio

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.377
wild.

00:04:08.377 --> 00:04:09.960
They had it pretty
good, the cats did.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.150
I mean, I watched Brad Pitt
pet some cats out there

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.370
at one point.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.619
And cats are just
roaming around.

00:04:16.619 --> 00:04:18.410
And of course, it was
so good for the cats.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.950
Life was good.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.324
The cats got on the phone,
they called all their friends.

00:04:21.324 --> 00:04:23.180
And everybody was
just coming in.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.400
So of course, what happens?

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.520
You get baby cats.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.820
So my friend found these cats.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.020
And she said, oh, no, Seth.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.960
There's more cats.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.364
And I'm thinking, oh, my gosh.

00:04:32.364 --> 00:04:34.280
So I was getting into
photography a little bit

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.910
at the time.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.480
I had just got a Canon Rebel
XT and a Sigma 24 to 70 lens.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.840
Not knowing a whole lot
about photography or cats,

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.390
I just said, you know what?

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.850
Why don't we use this Sony email
network that we have set up.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.740
We can just blast out an
email to everybody at Sony.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.470
We'll sneak these kittens
in to an executive's office

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.370
down the way.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.020
We'll take some
pictures of them.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.377
And we'll put them out there
in the Sony email network.

00:04:58.377 --> 00:05:00.460
Now, you're not really
supposed to use the network

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.434
for that kind of thing.

00:05:02.434 --> 00:05:04.350
But I'm like, well, what
are they going to do?

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.229
Are they going to
fire us for trying

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:07.270
to help homeless kittens.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.300
I'm like, that's a great
PR line right there.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.660
Sony fires employees for
helping homeless kittens.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.570
So anyways, that's what we did.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.370
We took these snapshots.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.390
My favorite is right here,
a little claw on the couch,

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.210
just leaving a little mark here.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.480
But we took these shots,
put them out on the network.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.570
And 24 hours later, all
the kittens were adopted.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:29.790
That's pretty cool.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.220
So then a couple weeks
later, guess what?

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.320
More baby cats, the
fire engine kittens.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.120
We found these kittens in a
fire engine trying to stay warm.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.511
And they were literally in a
fire engine near the engine.

00:05:39.511 --> 00:05:41.510
And they were just trying
to stay warm in there.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.760
So we did it again,
took some more pictures.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.936
They all got adopted.

00:05:44.936 --> 00:05:46.560
And I'm like, wow,
this is pretty cool.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.467
So I started volunteering at
the West LA Animal Shelter.

00:05:49.467 --> 00:05:51.425
I said, do you guys need
help with photography?

00:05:51.425 --> 00:05:53.549
You know, I've been
photographing these little baby

00:05:53.549 --> 00:05:56.320
cats, and they got adopted.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.227
Do you need any help?

00:05:57.227 --> 00:05:58.560
And they said, yeah, come on in.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.110
So I started volunteering to
take better adoption photos

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.500
to help find specific homes for
dogs and cats at the shelter.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.090
And that was back in 2007.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.620
So I'll do a slideshow,
just kind of the process

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.812
and how this all kind
of came to be for me.

00:06:12.812 --> 00:06:14.770
And these are taken over
the last several years

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.820
in different shelters
around the country.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.550
But I'm going to show you
typical intake shots and then

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.552
the more positive
adoption photo.

00:06:21.552 --> 00:06:23.010
So this is sort of
a typical intake

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.301
shot that you're going to find.

00:06:24.301 --> 00:06:27.500
As of a few years ago at an
animal shelter, not exactly

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.150
a great marketing tool for
little Gloria here, you know?

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.360
You see this and
generally, you're

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.100
going to be a little
bit terrified.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.800
Some people would argue, oh,
there's a sympathy card here.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.310
You're concerned, so you're
going to go into the rescue

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.730
and you're going to save Gloria.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.280
And that's true a tiny bit.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.570
But mostly what happens
is people are afraid.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.112
People see this, and they think,
I could never go in there.

00:06:48.112 --> 00:06:49.070
What am I going to see?

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.470
What kind of experience
am I going to have?

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.240
I could never be
my kids in there.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.530
And it turns people off.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.340
And I'm happy to say this even
though it's being recorded.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.960
There's a campaign out there
you may have seen on TV.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.940
And the shoutout's
to Sarah McLachlan.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.040
Images, Sarah
McLachlan music-- has

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.270
anybody seen the commercials?

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.254
AUDIENCE: I've seen the
"South Park" version.

00:07:06.254 --> 00:07:06.750
SETH CASTEEL: OK.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:07.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.960
SETH CASTEEL: And how many
people turn the channel,

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.680
change the channel
when they see that?

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.694
It's negative, right?

00:07:11.694 --> 00:07:12.610
It's a negative thing.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.776
And people just think, oh--
they hear the music now.

00:07:14.776 --> 00:07:17.920
Any time that song comes on,
you're just like, oh, my god.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.070
Now, in all fairness,
it is the ASPCA.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.340
I'm happy to talk about them.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.390
Their friends of mine.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.650
I love what they do.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.590
They're making a huge
difference overall.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.710
But I have to argue, is that
campaign really effective?

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.570
Now, it's not an
adoption campaign.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:32.790
It's a fundraising campaign.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.640
It's been extremely
successful for the ASPCA.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.330
But I argue-- and I'm still
looking for my meeting

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:39.760
with the president of the ASPCA.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.635
So ASPCA, if you're out
there on camera, call me.

00:07:43.635 --> 00:07:44.510
Let's have a meeting.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.926
And hopefully,
it'll be productive

00:07:45.926 --> 00:07:47.360
and I can help you guys out.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.990
But I have to
argue, at what cost

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.819
is that campaign causing
the entire effort?

00:07:51.819 --> 00:07:53.610
So yeah, they're raising
money, but they're

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.584
scaring people away.

00:07:54.584 --> 00:07:56.000
So many people see
the commercials

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.459
and they're terrified.

00:07:57.459 --> 00:07:58.750
They won't go into the shelter.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.830
And it's done a lot
of damage, I think,

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.980
for the image of
rescue and adoption.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.485
So the point of
doing this is-- even

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:06.930
though this is
stretched out, this

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:10.610
is kind of against
that campaign.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.160
So this is trying
to inspire people

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.750
to be a part of the cause,
inspire people to come in

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.230
and say hello,
embrace the animal

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:20.010
shelter or your local
rescue, and volunteer, adopt

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.406
a new little friend, rather
than change the channel.

00:08:22.406 --> 00:08:23.280
You know what I mean?

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.350
So this is kind of
what we're doing?

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.120
And these are just-- I'll do a
little slideshow here and kind

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.760
of show you what we're up to.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.260
Olive.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:35.799
You know, when these dogs
and cats come into the animal

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:37.716
shelter-- I want you
to look at Chubbs.

00:08:37.716 --> 00:08:39.299
And they look so
funny because they're

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:41.955
stressed out here a little bit.

00:08:41.955 --> 00:08:43.579
So when they come
in, they're coming in

00:08:43.579 --> 00:08:45.680
at all hours of the day,
all hours of the night,

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.990
from a variety of circumstances,
most of which are not positive.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.490
And you can only imagine
what Ruben's thinking here.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:52.890
Like, what is
going on right now?

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.110
So I do like the bandanna.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:56.620
I think that's a
plus, but overall,

00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:00.710
just not a very productive
marketing shot for Ruben here.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.990
And this is in
Chicago, taken in 2011.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.865
And this is probably
sometime in the evening.

00:09:05.865 --> 00:09:09.317
You know, you have a lead, which
is a chain, which is terrible.

00:09:09.317 --> 00:09:11.400
You have the ominous boots
and the legs over here.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.800
And this is just not
a really good shot.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.120
But unfortunately, you
know, when Ruben comes in,

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.690
an ID shot's taken.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.800
So it's basically just
to keep track who's who.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.300
And the ID shots
oftentimes are what

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:26.990
is used to find a
home for that pet.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.590
It's just not the
best opportunity

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.190
at that time to take a picture.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:32.040
And it's of no fault
of the shelter staff,

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.990
most of these people.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.480
So public shelters
have really no money.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.050
They always struggle
to find support.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:40.390
They have not enough staff.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:41.460
They have not
enough of anything.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.834
So they're just
struggling to try

00:09:42.834 --> 00:09:46.050
to do the best
they possibly can.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.090
They don't have proper
photography equipment.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:49.580
So this is kind of what
you're going to get.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.038
So I can't really
blame the people.

00:09:51.038 --> 00:09:53.510
It's just the situation.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.190
Here we go.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.345
I think this is better.

00:09:56.345 --> 00:09:58.220
But what we're finding
is people are actually

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.350
printing these images out.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:00.509
They see them online.

00:10:00.509 --> 00:10:01.300
They bring them in.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.466
And they want to meet Ruben.

00:10:02.466 --> 00:10:04.860
Or they want to meet this
little Min Pin right here.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.240
He's kind of funny.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.050
It cracks me up that
it's stretched out.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:10.632
But it's funny

00:10:10.632 --> 00:10:12.250
Baily-- this is also in Chicago.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.350
And this is the real
intake shot for Bailey.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:17.640
This is probably some
time back in 2010 or '11.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.140
Again, you wouldn't
really even know

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.400
what Baily looks like here.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.390
And you have this.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:25.990
I think it looks a
little better anyways.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:27.490
Wilma-- this is also in Chicago.

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:30.170
And when I started volunteering
in Chicago-- so basically,

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.142
I went from West
LA the South LA.

00:10:32.142 --> 00:10:34.100
I started traveling around
to different cities,

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.740
just volunteering at animal
shelters all over the place.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.990
And then I started my own
charity called Second Chance

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.109
Photos, just teaching
workshops to people

00:10:41.109 --> 00:10:43.650
who were interested about how
to take better adoption photos.

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:44.770
So that's kind of what
you're seeing here.

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.810
These are taken in cities
all over the country.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:48.250
I then started
teaching workshops

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:51.850
in other countries, in
Europe and also in Australia

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:56.657
and learn a lot about what
is effective for these guys.

00:10:56.657 --> 00:10:59.240
Wilma-- I mean, I think this is
just night and day right here.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.740
I mean, look at the
difference here.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.725
All these dogs got adopted,
which is pretty cool.

00:11:03.725 --> 00:11:05.100
And you wouldn't
really even know

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.950
what Black looks like here.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:07.680
There he is.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.809
SETH CASTEEL: Now, this is
a little smoke and mirrors,

00:11:10.809 --> 00:11:13.117
because one of my
secrets that I'll do

00:11:13.117 --> 00:11:14.950
is that if the dog is
allowed to have treat,

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:17.220
it is behaving a
little bit, then

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.020
I'll let the dog chew a treat
while I'm taking the picture.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.200
And you're seeing that here.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.204
It also works good for people.

00:11:23.204 --> 00:11:25.120
This guy's having a snack
back here right now.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.010
You can take a shot of him.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.440
It'd probably be pretty good.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:34.300
So then kind of fast forward--
so I was working at Sony.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.480
I went over to Disney.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.190
Oh, this is interesting,
because this

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.190
is going to be available
for people to download.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:41.410
I got fired from Disney Studios.

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:42.150
I did get fired.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.510
I walked in, got fired
for no good reason.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.270
However, I still love Disney.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:47.070
I love Disney.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:47.759
I always have.

00:11:47.759 --> 00:11:48.550
I love the message.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:51.590
It was a dream to go work
for Walt Disney Studios.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.830
Walt Disney has always
been one of my heroes.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.210
And I still love the company.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:56.490
I came in one day.

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.764
I'd been working 90, 100 hours
a week, working my tail off.

00:11:59.764 --> 00:12:00.680
I didn't get laid off.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.010
I got fired for reasons
completely beyond my control

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:05.260
that I didn't think were fair.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:11.030
But I decided that I would
rather work with dogs and cats.

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:13.140
So I walked in one day
and they said, you know,

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:14.510
you're out of here.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.050
And I didn't burn a bridge.

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:20.730
But I decided to spend my
time with dogs and cats.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:23.500
I'd already been developing
my craft as a photographer.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.360
I'd been doing the
volunteer thing.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.480
I'd been doing a little bit
of commissions on the weekend.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.130
People would say, can I hire
you to photograph my dog?

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:34.660
So basically, when that
fateful day happened in 2009

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:38.342
at Disney Studios, it was
ultimately a good day for me.

00:12:38.342 --> 00:12:39.550
I mean, that changed my life.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:40.740
If that didn't happen,
I would have never

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.439
been doing any of
these projects.

00:12:42.439 --> 00:12:44.730
And I would still-- I don't
know what I would be doing.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.230
who knows?

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:49.820
But so I really am
glad that happened.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.589
At the time, it seemed
kind of dramatic.

00:12:51.589 --> 00:12:53.005
But it did give
me the opportunity

00:12:53.005 --> 00:12:55.010
to go pursue what I really love.

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:56.530
And that's working with animals.

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:59.949
So I went off, did
that full time.

00:12:59.949 --> 00:13:01.240
Things weren't going that well.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.090
I was struggling to find enough
work to really make ends meet,

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:07.810
pay for my rent, pay for the
car, pay for health insurance

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:11.610
now, pay for a hot date
every once in awhile.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:14.070
That was adding up.

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:16.410
So I couldn't really afford
living in Los Angeles.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.410
And I had kind of
a ticking clock.

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:19.790
I mean, I was going to run out.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:23.730
I had about $50,000 in debt
already on the credit card.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.530
My cash flow was very limited.

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:28.340
My parents were like, oh,
how's it going out there?

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.880
I'm like, it's going great.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.800
They didn't know.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.120
So I struck a deal with
a company called Groupon.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.746
Everybody know Groupon?

00:13:35.746 --> 00:13:37.100
I struck a deal with Groupon.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.460
I was pretty excited about that.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.220
They approached me to do a deal
for a pet photography shoot.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.230
Now, it seemed also at
the time that Groupon

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.110
was approaching
everybody to do anything.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.650
So if you would do a
deal with Groupon--

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:51.454
so I guess it wasn't
that flattering.

00:13:51.454 --> 00:13:52.870
But I just thought,
you know what?

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:53.764
I got to stay busy.

00:13:53.764 --> 00:13:54.930
I got to find opportunities.

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:56.470
I got to work.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.626
I want to just work on my craft.

00:13:58.626 --> 00:13:59.750
And I thought, let's do it.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.610
For $59, you could hire me.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:04.380
I would come out to your home
or location of your choosing

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.040
to do a 30-minute photo shoot.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.980
You also get two 8 by 10 prints.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.190
And I made about $29
out of that deal.

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:13.830
So I made about half, a
little less than half.

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:16.260
So when I was-- it was
supposed to be a 10 mile

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.750
radius of my home is where
the shots could take place.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.750
No, it was more like 150 miles.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:24.760
So people were booking
me in Santa Barbara.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.720
People were booking
me in San Diego.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.052
So I was-- I don't know.

00:14:28.052 --> 00:14:29.760
I mean, I was like,
well, I got to do it.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.260
So I was driving
all over the place.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.990
And I was doing the math,
trying to be a business owner,

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:35.120
looking at the math of it.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.660
And I'm like, well,
I'm definitely

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.420
not making any money.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.337
How much am I loosing?

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:41.920
Because when you're driving to
Santa Barbara and back, I mean,

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.580
just do the math
on the gas alone.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.904
I mean, you're not
coming out ahead for $29.

00:14:46.904 --> 00:14:47.570
That's for sure.

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.500
A 30-minute shoot would extend
to an hour, an hour and a half,

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.974
two hours, sometimes
even longer,

00:14:52.974 --> 00:14:54.390
and then all the
time I'm spending

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:55.681
on editing and everything else.

00:14:55.681 --> 00:14:57.945
So it was really an epic
fail for me to do the Groupon

00:14:57.945 --> 00:15:00.070
shoot, except for this
little character right here.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:01.450
He's the knight
in shining armor.

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.491
This is Buster the Cavalier
King Charles Spaniel.

00:15:03.491 --> 00:15:07.940
I show up at his house in
2010 at a Groupon photo shoot.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.730
And he decided he would rather
be in the pool than on land.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:12.580
This is a shot.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.330
I did this interview
with NBC Nightly News

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.954
with Brian Williams
a couple weeks ago.

00:15:15.954 --> 00:15:18.070
And they asked me, do you
have any original shots

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:20.107
of Buster from when
you first met him?

00:15:20.107 --> 00:15:21.690
So I looked back at
an old hard drive.

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:23.106
I haven't seen
these in years now.

00:15:23.106 --> 00:15:24.700
I just haven't thought about it.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:25.720
And I came across these.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.261
This is now one of my favorite
shots I think I've ever taken.

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:31.070
Because this is right before
everything began for me.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:32.340
I didn't know it at the time.

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.756
You can already
see he's wet here.

00:15:33.756 --> 00:15:35.360
So he's already been
in probably once.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.735
And now he's
looking at us again,

00:15:36.735 --> 00:15:38.330
saying-- in the
background, I have

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.220
Jane, who's Buster's human.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.820
You'd better not do that.

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.510
And he's thinking, oh,
yeah, I'm going in.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.187
So of course he went
in over and over again.

00:15:47.187 --> 00:15:48.770
She wasn't happy
about it, because she

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:51.030
wanted some beautiful
dry land shots of Buster

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:53.210
with this hair
blowing in the breeze.

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:54.397
And I said, wait a second.

00:15:54.397 --> 00:15:55.730
Maybe there's something to this.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:58.370
I left, bought the little point
and shoot underwater camera.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:00.750
It was a Sony, I think a TX5.

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:03.850
I came back and started
doing these kind of shots,

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.867
knowing really nothing about
underwater photography,

00:16:06.867 --> 00:16:07.950
nothing about this camera.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:09.910
I wasn't even sure if
I was taking pictures.

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:13.110
It was kind of confusing.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:15.240
But you can see him
in the background.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.700
And then you have-- this
is kind of the transition.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.162
He's going in.

00:16:19.162 --> 00:16:20.120
And then you have that.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.289
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:21.289 --> 00:16:23.330
And so this is the very
first underwater dog shot

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:24.180
that I took.

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:25.690
And this is back in 2010.

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:26.870
I didn't know I had this.

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:30.590
I got home and saw it was
just like, wait a second.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:31.580
This is unbelievable.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.560
I was so excited about it.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.060
So of course, I sent this
to Jane, my friend Jane.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.280
I said, oh, my god, Jane.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.469
You know, you have to see what
Buster looks like underwater.

00:16:40.469 --> 00:16:41.510
And she said, yeah, yeah.

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:42.840
But we didn't get the
dry shots, you know.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.070
You've got to come back
down here and get this.

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.110
So I went back down.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:49.750
I drove back down because
we didn't get the dry shots,

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:50.585
did the drive shots.

00:16:50.585 --> 00:16:52.158
AUDIENCE: For $29.

00:16:52.158 --> 00:16:54.367
SETH CASTEEL: Yeah,
back and forth.

00:16:54.367 --> 00:16:56.700
Who knows how much money I
lost initially on that shoot.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:00.470
But as it turns out, it
was a good idea anyway.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:01.651
So we went back, did this.

00:17:01.651 --> 00:17:03.400
And then I was just
getting really curious

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.524
about the underwater thing.

00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:07.386
So I started doing
more shots of Buster,

00:17:07.386 --> 00:17:09.510
playing around different
types of underwater camera

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:11.140
gear, underwater camera bags.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.319
I tried out different
types of casings.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:16.349
I rented a dive housing one
time for $500 for the weekend,

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:18.500
and it broke.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:19.300
Oh, it was tough.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.589
But I was interested in learning
about underwater photography

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:25.400
and also just fascinated with
dogs and their connection

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.540
to the water.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.550
So I was just doing these,
various types of lighting,

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:31.000
really no idea what I'm doing.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.340
But Buster here, he kind of
helped me figured it all out.

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:37.639
Did this, which is now a tattoo
on my arm, which you see.

00:17:37.639 --> 00:17:38.930
Oh, there's me underwater here.

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:43.455
But you have this picture now is
actually right here on my arm.

00:17:43.455 --> 00:17:45.656
Look how noble
Buster looks here.

00:17:45.656 --> 00:17:47.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.360
SETH CASTEEL: He's just
so proud, you know?

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.810
But yeah, so this
shot is actually

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:53.240
one of my favorite shots.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.200
And this is a picture I did
with an underwater camera bag,

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.200
as it turns out.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.720
I put it on a hard drive.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.750
I mean, I was taking all kinds
of pictures, didn't really know

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:01.550
what I was looking for.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.430
I put it on a hard drive,
didn't even realize

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:05.138
I had this shot until
about a year later.

00:18:05.138 --> 00:18:06.610
I went back through
and found it.

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:09.320
And now it's on my arm forever.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.570
People say, wow, you have
somebody else's dog tattooed

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:14.260
on your arm.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.470
But this is the guy that
changed my life forever.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:19.880
And if I could buy
him a beer, I would.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.730
But he has unlimited
dog treats from me

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:24.150
for the rest of eternity.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.850
But here's a little
selfie we did.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:29.522
I don't know who got
the ball on this take.

00:18:29.522 --> 00:18:30.730
I look like I might have got.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:34.390
Or I might have got part of
his mouth in my foot too.

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:35.862
It's hard to say.

00:18:35.862 --> 00:18:37.820
OK, there's us.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.680
And then after working
with Buster, I was like,

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.030
who else likes to swim?

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.890
As it turns out, a lot
of dogs like to swim.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:45.598
And they have a
connection with the water

00:18:45.598 --> 00:18:47.790
that goes back
almost 20,000 years.

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.130
So I started working with
all these guys, all kinds

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.630
of different types
of dogs, and just

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.780
doing fun photo
shoots just for fun,

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:55.150
not making any money on it.

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:57.130
| invested the last
few thousand dollars

00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:00.150
I had available on a credit
card in a surf housing, which

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.400
is an underwater housing
designed for surf photographers

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.140
and surfers.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.000
So I bought this.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.610
It's from SPL Water Housings.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:09.850
And mostly I bought it
because it was more affordable

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:10.850
than a dive housing.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:12.850
And I liked that it
was bright yellow.

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:14.415
I thought that could
come into play.

00:19:14.415 --> 00:19:16.790
And I like that I didn't have
to buy additional lighting.

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:19.020
I could just put my
flash on top of it.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.710
So I created the original series
with this housing and a Canon

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:25.690
70 with a Tokina 10
to 17 fisheye lens

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:28.730
and made these shots
really, just for fun.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:31.470
See all these clowns and
all kinds of different dogs.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.230
This is a Cocker Spaniel here.

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:35.116
This is a Jack Russell terrier.

00:19:35.116 --> 00:19:37.490
And this shot ended up in
"National Geographic Magazine,"

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:40.736
"Visions of Earth"
back in August of 2012.

00:19:40.736 --> 00:19:44.420
That was a dream come
true right there.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.390
This shot right
here, this was a shot

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:49.200
that really took my
photography from nobody

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.490
knew about me to everybody
knows about "Underwater Dogs."

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:55.730
This happened on
February 9, of 2012.

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:57.350
And I have a couple
people to thank

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:58.900
including reddit and Google.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.087
So thanks, Google.

00:20:00.087 --> 00:20:01.420
A lot of people don't know that.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:05.334
But this image became
a top thread on reddit.

00:20:05.334 --> 00:20:06.750
And then it moved
through Google+.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.916
It moved through all kinds
of different social media

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:09.634
platforms.

00:20:09.634 --> 00:20:11.800
We tried to track exactly
what all-- and it was just

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.460
a frenzy of action.

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.070
But it happened overnight.

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:17.664
And then no one exactly knows
how many tens of millions

00:20:17.664 --> 00:20:19.080
of people saw the
shots overnight.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.450
But it was out of control.

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:21.510
My website was crashed.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:22.885
My website was on
a shared server

00:20:22.885 --> 00:20:25.010
with GoDaddy with
limited bandwidth.

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:26.720
And it was just down.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.484
But I like to think what you
can't have, you want more.

00:20:29.484 --> 00:20:31.150
So people were trying
to get on my site.

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:32.524
Oh, man, I can't
get on the site.

00:20:32.524 --> 00:20:37.140
So it's a funny little game.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.600
But yeah, so this was the
shot that kind of went viral

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.020
on February 9 of-- well,
it didn't kind of go viral.

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:42.710
It went viral.

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.800
I had no idea that
could even happen.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.340
And my life has never
been the same since then.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:51.100
So out of control-- here's the
first book, "Underwater Dogs."

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.640
So basically, when the images
went viral, one went viral.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.640
Then people started picking
up the rest of them.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.100
And it just made a whole round.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.810
And I'm talking
about a global round.

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:02.502
I mean, everywhere,
all over the place.

00:21:02.502 --> 00:21:03.960
The inquiries I
was getting-- I was

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.019
getting 10,000 emails a day.

00:21:07.019 --> 00:21:08.310
I don't know how that happened.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:12.500
I mean, I was tracking traffic
on my website at 150,000.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.420
And my website was crashed
most the time, you know?

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.720
And I was still getting
that many emails.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.460
I didn't have an assistant.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.970
I was trying to figure out
which emails were important.

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:24.429
The next morning, I was on the
phone with CNN World Report.

00:21:24.429 --> 00:21:26.219
On the other line was
Good Morning America.

00:21:26.219 --> 00:21:28.493
And I was trying to figure
out who was more important.

00:21:28.493 --> 00:21:29.114
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:29.114 --> 00:21:31.530
SETH CASTEEL: So I could get
into this for a little while.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:34.820
But basically, as
a photographer,

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.431
you always hope to make a
living maybe as a photographer.

00:21:37.431 --> 00:21:39.430
I mean, I certainly was
trying to make a living.

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:40.926
That was my career.

00:21:40.926 --> 00:21:43.050
And I'm like, wow, I've
been handed an opportunity.

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:44.840
I've got to seize
the moment here.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.691
You know, I found
my underwater dog.

00:21:46.691 --> 00:21:47.940
Now I've had this opportunity.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:48.648
Seize the moment.

00:21:48.648 --> 00:21:49.820
Make the most of it.

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.270
And so I just went after it.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:52.660
I did all kinds of interviews.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.800
I fielded inquiries
from literary agents,

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.290
knowing nothing
about publishing.

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:59.080
I selected a book agent named
Michelle Tessler based out

00:21:59.080 --> 00:21:59.600
of New York.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.720
I didn't know if that
was the right choice.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.800
She liked dogs.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.190
I like dogs.

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:06.354
So we teamed up,
made a book proposal.

00:22:06.354 --> 00:22:07.395
The book went to auction.

00:22:07.395 --> 00:22:10.050
All the major publishers and
a bunch of other publishers

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:11.690
bid on the rights
to sell the book.

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:13.760
I'm on the phone one
day with Random House

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.002
and Simon Schuster and
HarperCollins a Chronicle.

00:22:16.002 --> 00:22:17.960
And I really don't even
know what was going on.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.380
It was a really good
problem to have.

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:21.630
But everybody bid on the book.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:22.780
It went to three rounds.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.965
Little Brown, Random
House, and Simon Schuster

00:22:24.965 --> 00:22:26.770
were the final three bidders.

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:28.290
And I ended up
choosing Little Brown

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:29.750
and turning down Random House.

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.290
I'm sorry, Random House.

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:31.930
I like you.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.635
But it just didn't work out.

00:22:33.635 --> 00:22:34.885
Little Brown's been wonderful.

00:22:34.885 --> 00:22:36.945
I'm really happy
to work with them.

00:22:36.945 --> 00:22:38.450
They're also big dog people.

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:41.040
So we went out, shot
the book in 60 days

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.620
all around the country, 300
dogs, published the book

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.387
October, 2012.

00:22:45.387 --> 00:22:47.220
The initial print run
was extremely limited.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:49.610
The book was sold out for almost
a month around the holidays.

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:51.780
Even though it was one of
a Oprah's favorite books

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.112
of the year, you couldn't
buy it almost anywhere.

00:22:54.112 --> 00:22:56.070
But it was still a "New
York Times" best seller

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:58.150
for 11 weeks, the
bestselling photographer book

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:01.200
of the year, one of the
bestselling books ever made

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.680
with over a half a million
copies in print right now,

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.940
13 editions around the world.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:07.550
And it's just dogs jumping
into swimming pools.

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:08.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:10.730
SETH CASTEEL: Pretty crazy.

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:13.430
But anyways, it was
just phenomenal for me.

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:16.170
You know, I have to
pinch myself every day

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:18.100
because of what's happened.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.530
So we made a kids book too.

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:22.750
Some of the adults thought the
images were too primal or too

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:25.950
scary for the kids, which was
weird, because all the kids I

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:27.624
was hanging out
with, they thought

00:23:27.624 --> 00:23:28.665
the shots were hilarious.

00:23:28.665 --> 00:23:31.630
Or we made a kids
book for adults

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:33.626
and included a free
poster for them.

00:23:33.626 --> 00:23:34.564
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:34.564 --> 00:23:36.480
SETH CASTEEL: There's
some fun rhymes in here.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.230
I'm not much of a writer.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:39.540
I'm technically an author.

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.250
But I'm not much of a writer.

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.742
I wouldn't consider
myself a very good writer.

00:23:43.742 --> 00:23:45.700
But I did get to write
some fun rhymes in here.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.602
Little Brown said,
hey, you know,

00:23:47.602 --> 00:23:49.560
we're going to hire
someone to write your book.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:50.480
I'm like, what?

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.606
I can't do it?

00:23:52.606 --> 00:23:53.730
So I wrote some fun rhymes.

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:54.510
I don't know if they're good.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:55.843
But I think they're appropriate.

00:23:55.843 --> 00:23:57.892
And that was a lot of fun.

00:23:57.892 --> 00:23:59.350
Also, some of the
kids were ripping

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:01.391
the pages out of the books,
they were so excited,

00:24:01.391 --> 00:24:03.670
apparently, or
they're just kids.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:04.820
So we made board books.

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:07.414
Those were published
a few months back.

00:24:07.414 --> 00:24:08.830
And so we have
colors and numbers.

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:10.030
If you're learning
to count to 10,

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.446
I recommend the
book on the right.

00:24:11.446 --> 00:24:14.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:17.010
SETH CASTEEL: Puppies-- after
"Underwater Dogs" happened,

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:20.420
we thought, all right,
what's going to happen next?

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.471
Underwater cats-- the natural--

00:24:22.471 --> 00:24:22.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:23.725
SETH CASTEEL: The
natural choice.

00:24:23.725 --> 00:24:24.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:27.392
SETH CASTEEL: I bought the
website, underwatercats.com.

00:24:27.392 --> 00:24:31.500
If you go there, you will find
approximately zero pictures.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.120
But I thought one day, if
the world's upside down,

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.360
dogs are cats and cats
are dogs, at least

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.390
I'll be ready for that.

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.360
I have been swimming
with some cats.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.420
They choose to get in.

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.830
Turkish Vans, Maine
Coons, Bangles,

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:45.040
some other exotic mixes
do you have a history

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.450
with the water and
appreciation for the water.

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:48.700
And they get in and swim.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.690
Now, it's not every cat
within those breeds.

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:54.690
But certainly you will find
some swimming cats out there,

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:57.780
but not diving in and
not the same relationship

00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.240
that we find with dogs.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:02.795
So that book's on
hold indefinitely.

00:25:02.795 --> 00:25:05.690
Now, I have been swimming
with some exotic cats.

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:08.750
I've been in the water with
tigers as well as bobcats.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:10.179
And you could make a series.

00:25:10.179 --> 00:25:11.220
And I've done some shots.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.450
You could make a
series about that.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:14.110
I don't think you
could do a full book.

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:16.190
And it's also not domestic cats.

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:19.050
So most of us wouldn't
have a relationship

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:21.550
with a tiger or a bobcat.

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:23.740
But many of us, of course,
do have relationships

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.490
with domestic cats,
so maybe one day.

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:28.120
Puppies-- in "Underwater
Dogs," you'll

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.910
find a couple of puppies,
one of which is 12 weeks.

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:32.840
The other is six months.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.964
I thought, well, could I make
a whole book with puppies?

00:25:35.964 --> 00:25:36.630
It would be fun.

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:38.390
But I don't know if I can.

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:40.280
So I started just
exploring the idea

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:44.020
of working with puppies to find
out if it was even possible

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:45.524
and how I felt about it.

00:25:45.524 --> 00:25:47.440
And what I found was not
only could I make it,

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.760
but it needed to be made for
two very important reasons.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.250
And the first is the
most critical reason.

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:54.990
It's water safety for pets.

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:59.190
So every year, it's estimated
between 7 and 10,000 dogs

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:01.890
drown in swimming pools
in the United States.

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:02.961
That's a lot of dogs.

00:26:02.961 --> 00:26:04.210
Now, there's millions of dogs.

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:06.050
But 7 to 10,000,
that's a lot of dogs.

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:07.450
It's a shocking number.

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:08.480
And I hate to say that.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.290
This is a very joyful project.

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:12.390
But the sense of urgency
about water safety

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:13.410
is very, very high.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:17.260
And it's not because people
don't like their dogs.

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:18.850
You know, people
just don't understand

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:20.650
the dangers of a
swimming pool, especially

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:23.839
in states like California,
Arizona, Texas, Florida.

00:26:23.839 --> 00:26:25.630
I mean, in neighborhoods,
you'll find pools

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:27.000
at every single home.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.090
And pools are on the rise,
more and more pools every year.

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:32.380
The weather seems to be
getting hotter everywhere.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.030
More and more pools
are happening,

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:34.980
more and more danger.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:36.854
Now, pools can be a lot
of fun for all of us.

00:26:36.854 --> 00:26:38.700
But they're also a
major, major danger

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.254
for pets and human
children as well.

00:26:41.254 --> 00:26:42.670
But people don't
think about that.

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:42.920
I ask folks.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.110
I'm like, would you leave
your 18-month-old human baby

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:47.040
unattended in your
backyard next to your pool

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.310
while your away at work?

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:49.752
No, I would never do that.

00:26:49.752 --> 00:26:51.960
But the same people would
potentially leave their dog

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.710
there, who's never
been in the pool before

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:56.790
and has no proper experience
in understanding what it is

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:58.320
or how to get out.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.060
So all puppies know
how to swim when

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.970
they're three or four weeks old.

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:04.240
You put them into the water,
or even above the water,

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.890
and they start to
check things out.

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:06.630
It's an instinct.

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:07.560
It's hardwired in.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.615
They know how to do it.

00:27:08.615 --> 00:27:09.540
It's the doggy paddle.

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.976
And they start off slow.

00:27:10.976 --> 00:27:12.100
And then they'll go faster.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:12.870
And you put them in.

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:14.494
Most of them are
buoyant little things.

00:27:14.494 --> 00:27:17.990
And they'll just--
and they're terrific.

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:19.100
But they need to practice.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:19.880
They need to practice.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.130
They need to build confidence.

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:23.310
And most importantly,
they need to understand

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.767
how to get out of
a swimming pool.

00:27:24.767 --> 00:27:26.100
And that's the number one thing.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.590
That's the number
one thing that we

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:29.010
have to make sure we get across.

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:31.184
Because you're dog
falls into the pool.

00:27:31.184 --> 00:27:32.850
They're going to make
an effort to swim.

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:34.933
They're going to make an
effort to try to get out.

00:27:34.933 --> 00:27:37.940
But it's not a natural body of
water, so there's a disconnect.

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.120
If you're at a lake, if
you're in a stream, a river,

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.787
the ocean, anything
that's natural,

00:27:41.787 --> 00:27:44.120
chances are you're going to
have multiple options of how

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.020
to get out, because
there's going

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:47.436
to be some kind of a natural
gradient or natural way

00:27:47.436 --> 00:27:48.310
to find yourself out.

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:49.810
A lot of pools these
days still just

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:52.990
have ladders or will just have
one exit, which is stairs.

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:55.340
And it may not be
accommodating at all for a dog.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.805
Most dogs that drown drown
two feet away from the exit.

00:27:57.805 --> 00:28:00.517
They just swim around
circles and they don't know.

00:28:00.517 --> 00:28:01.100
It's terrible.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.020
They're not great climbers.

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:03.436
So they can't pull
themselves out.

00:28:03.436 --> 00:28:05.320
It happens all the time.

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:08.440
It's not because people are--
they're not deliberately

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.420
trying to set their
pet up for disaster.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:11.252
But it's happening.

00:28:11.252 --> 00:28:12.960
So there's a lot of
other things going on

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.810
with swimming pools
in terms of safety,

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:17.850
limiting access, fences,
alarms, a lot of things

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:19.010
that should be happening.

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:20.900
But also, preparing
your pet to be safe

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.120
is the number one thing.

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.640
That number should not
be between 7 and 10,000.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.070
I mean, that's just
ridiculous, if you ask me.

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:28.640
So that's what
this book promotes.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.260
It's promoting water
safety for pets.

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:34.860
You know, if I can improve
that number even just

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:38.201
a little bit and I sell no
books, that's fine with me,

00:28:38.201 --> 00:28:38.700
you know?

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.320
I just want to get
the message out there.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.611
So that's the number one thing.

00:28:41.611 --> 00:28:43.670
The number two thing
is rescue and adoption.

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:44.920
That's how I got started.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:47.336
Most of the puppies you'll
find in here are rescue puppies

00:28:47.336 --> 00:28:48.570
and have since been adopted.

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:51.210
I finished the book
about a year ago.

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:53.910
And just as a reminder
to folks that you

00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:58.220
can find wonderful pets at
your local animal shelter.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:00.500
And I think so many people
just don't realize that.

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.870
I was talking to a friend
of mine pretty recently.

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:05.360
And he has a puppy enrolled
in a puppy training class.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:08.880
And it's the only rescue puppy
out of 12 or 13 in there.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.550
And you're thinking,
why is that?

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:11.800
You know, why is it happening?

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.508
I don't criticize
people for buying dogs,

00:29:13.508 --> 00:29:16.870
but I do suggest to people
to consider rescuing a pet

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:18.710
because I think it's
a terrific option.

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:20.640
Most people just
don't understand

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:23.350
you can get a great,
great dog, a great cat.

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:25.250
They're not broken, you know?

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:26.840
They're not having problems.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.266
They are terrific pets.

00:29:29.266 --> 00:29:30.730
You just got to go and do it.

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:31.384
That's it.

00:29:31.384 --> 00:29:32.800
And you could find
pure bred dogs.

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.710
You can find mixed breed dogs.

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:35.659
You can find puppies.

00:29:35.659 --> 00:29:36.700
I mean, I've seen it all.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.790
And I will tell you, no
matter what you want to find,

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:40.220
you can find it through
a shelter or rescue.

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:43.047
It might take you a couple extra
minutes to do the research,

00:29:43.047 --> 00:29:43.880
but you can find it.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.930
So I thought it was
cool to kind of feature

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:49.856
some of these guys as my little
rescue puppy ambassadors.

00:29:49.856 --> 00:29:51.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:53.690
SETH CASTEEL: This
is in Chicago.

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:55.650
So I worked with
about 1,500 puppies

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:59.280
on this project, mostly
just as a swim teacher,

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.380
and occasionally
as a photographer.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:02.670
Most the poppies came out.

00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:05.640
They got initial lessons to
understand their physicality

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.750
in the water,
buoyancy, and start

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:09.600
to condition them
to look for the exit

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.610
and find their way out.

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:14.772
Out of 1,500, you'll find just
72 in the book, 105 pictures.

00:30:14.772 --> 00:30:16.730
Most of the puppies didn't
get pictures at all.

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:20.049
They just swim A to B a
couple times and they go home.

00:30:20.049 --> 00:30:21.590
Some of the puppies
obviously decided

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:23.430
that they do enjoy
themselves here.

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:26.940
And they were very
curious and became playful

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:30.620
and would jump in, either at
me, with me, or chase toys.

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:32.966
So those are the puppies
you'll find in the book.

00:30:32.966 --> 00:30:35.460
And it was kind of my job
once I figured out, OK,

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.947
who's dominating right now?

00:30:37.947 --> 00:30:38.780
Who's ready to play?

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:40.590
And then I'd just grab
my camera do some shots.

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:42.250
But there were some
photo shoot events.

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:43.230
In Chicago, I had one.

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:44.590
We had 30 puppies come out.

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:46.910
Zero pictures in the
book out of 30 puppies.

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:48.940
I spent all day, flew in.

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:49.900
My gear didn't arrive.

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:52.920
I had to have my backup gear
flown in overnight for $400.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.890
Weeks of planning, not
a single book shot.

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:56.910
Everybody got a lesson.

00:30:56.910 --> 00:30:59.290
But then this particular day,
I mean, we had this shot.

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:00.150
We had this shot.

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:01.839
We probably had 15 book shots.

00:31:01.839 --> 00:31:04.130
And so you never really know
when it's going to happen.

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:05.310
So it's kind of cool.

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:07.702
But this was maybe going
to be the book cover.

00:31:07.702 --> 00:31:09.535
But we thought maybe
it's a little too sassy

00:31:09.535 --> 00:31:10.760
to be the book cover.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.290
This is Ginger,
all grown up now.

00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:13.520
I saw her the other day.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.020
She's a wonderful
swimmer, and looks

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:17.080
almost the same--
same markings--

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.280
just a little bit older.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:20.100
This is Raleigh.

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:21.800
This is in Tucson, Arizona.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.630
Quick note about this-- so
this is an outdoor pool.

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:27.670
I work with outdoor pools
and indoor pools for this.

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:29.360
Water temperature
was very important.

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.600
Between 80 and 92
degrees is where

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.090
I like to have the water for
the puppies and for myself,

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:35.215
but mostly for the puppies.

00:31:35.215 --> 00:31:36.714
We wouldn't teach
our human children

00:31:36.714 --> 00:31:38.370
to swim in 40 degree water.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:39.421
I hope not.

00:31:39.421 --> 00:31:41.670
So these guys, you want to
make them feel comfortable.

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:43.503
You don't want to shock
them by putting them

00:31:43.503 --> 00:31:45.150
in water that's too cold.

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:47.910
This water actually
is in Tucson.

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:50.915
And I knew it was cold
at night in Tucson.

00:31:50.915 --> 00:31:52.040
So I called the pool owner.

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.799
And I'm like, hey, man.

00:31:53.799 --> 00:31:55.340
It's been getting
kind of cold there.

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:55.910
How's the water?

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:57.120
He's like, it's kind of cold.

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:57.920
Do you have a heater?

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:58.420
Yeah.

00:31:58.420 --> 00:31:59.020
Turn it on.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:31:59.652
OK.

00:31:59.652 --> 00:32:00.610
He turns on the heater.

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:01.526
I arrive the next day.

00:32:01.526 --> 00:32:02.730
It's 100 degrees out.

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:06.430
The heaters still on and the
bubble tarp is on top of it.

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:09.950
We peel it back-- 107 degrees.

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:10.450
I know.

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:11.741
So we went to the refrigerator.

00:32:11.741 --> 00:32:14.450
We got a bunch ice cubes,
we're throwing them in.

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:16.080
You got to try something.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.900
So we got it down to 102 by
the time the puppies arrived.

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.490
And we had the opposite problem.

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:22.573
The puppied could only be
in for a couple minutes,

00:32:22.573 --> 00:32:24.220
because it's just
too hot for them.

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:27.702
But we were able to get a
couple of really cool shots.

00:32:27.702 --> 00:32:28.910
These are my little terriers.

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:30.660
This kind of thing
doesn't happen very often.

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:33.118
When they jump in, some of the
puppies are getting playful.

00:32:33.118 --> 00:32:34.060
And learn about it.

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.100
They jump in.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.575
And when they jump
in together, I mean,

00:32:37.575 --> 00:32:39.700
that's the kind of thing
that doesn't happen often.

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.070
So I'm really happy that
these two little Chicago

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:43.180
puppies are in the book.

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:46.820
They're little terriers
named Pringles and Pickme.

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.450
You'll also notice the
lights behind here.

00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:50.627
You can see these lights.

00:32:50.627 --> 00:32:51.710
These are not pool lights.

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:53.710
These are what's called
off-board strobes.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:56.290
Any photographers in here?

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:58.510
I'm the only guy.

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:00.570
Well, it's not super exciting.

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:02.570
But I'll just kind of
tell you how it goes down.

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:06.230
So I'm using a dive housing now
by Ikelite, Ikelite Underwater

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.730
Systems.

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:08.450
So it's basically
a case designed

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:10.930
for going really
deep, 200 feet deep.

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:14.777
I'm only underwater here
about two feet or so.

00:33:14.777 --> 00:33:15.860
And I'm using two strobes.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.771
They're called DS161's.

00:33:17.771 --> 00:33:19.770
One here, one here-- and
I can move them around.

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:21.670
I can change the
intensity of the strobe.

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:24.000
I'm also dropping in what's
called off-board strobes.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.500
They're not connected
to the camera.

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.740
They have a funny little device
on them called an EV manual

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:28.239
controller.

00:33:28.239 --> 00:33:29.350
It's like an eyeball.

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:33.240
What happens is it looks for
a change in ambient light.

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.530
So when I drop this down
at the bottom of the pool,

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:38.000
when I fire off my flashes,
this flash goes off.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.722
I can drop one of
those, two of those.

00:33:39.722 --> 00:33:41.180
It also creates
little catch lights

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:42.680
in the top right of the image.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.530
That's caused by
the off-bard strobe.

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:46.613
It just improves the images,
I think, technically.

00:33:46.613 --> 00:33:49.419
And we can see the dogs
a little bit better.

00:33:49.419 --> 00:33:49.960
But it's fun.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.070
Sometimes I drop none in.

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:53.620
Sometimes I drop 1, 10.

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:55.140
It's about $1,700 apiece.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:56.760
So sometimes you're in the pool.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:59.865
You're thinking, I've got
about $32,000 in here.

00:33:59.865 --> 00:34:01.550
I didn't have
insurance on the gear.

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:03.849
But everything's fine.

00:34:03.849 --> 00:34:05.265
But this is little
Eva the Beagle.

00:34:05.265 --> 00:34:07.050
Here's what she looks like now.

00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:08.100
Fun, huh?

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.308
All grown up, same markings.

00:34:09.308 --> 00:34:10.224
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:10.224 --> 00:34:11.719
SETH CASTEEL: Yeah, I just
saw this dog the other day.

00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:12.559
And I was like, wow.

00:34:12.559 --> 00:34:14.239
So I just had this
in here today,

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:16.340
because they sent
me these pictures.

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:17.030
And it's crazy.

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:18.530
I mean, here, she's
about six weeks.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:20.399
And here, she's about
a year and six weeks.

00:34:20.399 --> 00:34:23.060
Kind of fun, huh?

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:23.889
This is Corey.

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:26.920
This is also in Tucson in
water that's about 80 degrees.

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.730
I just really like how
vivid this shot is.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:31.461
and in the moment, he
looks pretty happy.

00:34:31.461 --> 00:34:33.710
There were six of these
little cattle dog mix puppies,

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:35.860
all rescues in Tucson.

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:37.267
This is another one, Zelda.

00:34:37.267 --> 00:34:39.850
This is my favorite shot in the
book-- and I'll tell you why--

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:42.280
not because it's the
best technically.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.530
It's not even underwater.

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:44.889
It's an over-under shot.

00:34:44.889 --> 00:34:47.449
The reason why I like it--
so Zelda and Corey, brother

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:48.540
and sister.

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:53.070
Zelda's a special needs puppy,
needs some additional TLC.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:55.320
The people that we're looking
after Zelda were saying,

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.554
she's not ready for
swimming, you know?

00:34:57.554 --> 00:34:58.220
She's not ready.

00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:59.424
She's not ready.

00:34:59.424 --> 00:35:00.840
And I was thinking,
wait a minute.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.950
Zelda's allowed to be
around swimming pools.

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:05.420
She's going to be adopted
by someone here in Arizona

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.980
and probably live at a place
where there's a swimming pool.

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.230
She needs a lesson.

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:10.560
They said, no, no, no, no.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.640
That's not going to work.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:15.515
So little Zelda here watched
me, Corey, and the other four

00:35:15.515 --> 00:35:17.540
do the swim lessons
for about a half hour.

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:19.430
All of a sudden, I hear splash.

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:21.910
Zelda jumped in on her
own, jumped on her own.

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:23.637
And she swam right to the exit.

00:35:23.637 --> 00:35:24.470
And it's a big pool.

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:25.839
She swam right to the exit.

00:35:25.839 --> 00:35:26.880
I wasn't even over there.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:27.990
But she had watched us.

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:30.190
And she had watched all
of her little friends

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:31.090
learn how to get out.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:32.910
And she learned how to get out.

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:35.320
And that was my proudest
moment during the whole book.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.640
And that's what it's all about.

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.112
So this little puppy
is safer for that.

00:35:39.112 --> 00:35:40.320
So I had to put her in there.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.861
I mean, she didn't
jump in 100 times.

00:35:41.861 --> 00:35:43.240
But she watched and she learned.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.477
She did it on her own.

00:35:44.477 --> 00:35:46.310
And I'm like, that's
what I'm talking about.

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:49.550
I was just so proud.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:51.827
This is kind of another
sassy shot, Monte.

00:35:51.827 --> 00:35:52.660
This is in New York.

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:55.440
City there's a pool
for dogs in the city

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.660
of New York in Manhattan
called Water for Dogs.

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:00.700
And it's mostly a
hydrotherapy pool.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:03.880
So they're rehabilitating
dogs from injury

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:08.200
or as a sort of
recovery from surgery.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.260
Hydrotherapy is an
incredible thing

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:13.210
that is improving the quality
of life for thousands of dogs

00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:15.070
here in the States and
all around the world.

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:18.660
And it's wonderful that more
and more pools are popping up.

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.950
And dogs can have a much
higher quality of life

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:24.900
and can extend their lives
by years because of it.

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:26.904
So that's what this
pool was designed for.

00:36:26.904 --> 00:36:29.320
Also, apparently, it's designed
for underwater puppy photo

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.214
shoots.

00:36:30.214 --> 00:36:32.130
So I went in here to
have a few New York dogs.

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:33.880
I thought this kind of
looks like the movie

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:34.900
"The Ring" a little bit.

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:37.530
But just real sassy.

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:39.360
I mean, I love--
with underwater dog,

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.580
you see such a
range of emotions.

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:42.930
This dog is sleeping right here.

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:44.180
I got to be more entertaining.

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:45.142
[LAUGHING]

00:36:45.142 --> 00:36:47.100
SETH CASTEEL: You see
such a range of emotions.

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.120
I feel like dogs have
a very similar range

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.810
of emotions to human beings.

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:52.786
And that's why we connect
with them so much.

00:36:52.786 --> 00:36:54.910
And that's why we can also
appreciate these images.

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:58.299
Because maybe in each picture
we see a little bit of too.

00:36:58.299 --> 00:36:59.590
So I like to put that in there.

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:03.520
Also, point it out-- this is a
hairy hairless Chinese crested.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.690
And I think it was 10 weeks
or 11 weeks, named Scooter.

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:09.020
It also goes to
show you not just

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:11.060
the labs and golden
retrievers like to swim.

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.550
So many people say that to me.

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:15.190
Oh, it's just labs a
golden retrievers, right?

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:16.580
I meet labs and
golden retrievers

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:20.910
all the time that don't like to
swim or are not good swimmers.

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:23.010
And it's because of
whatever their history is.

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:24.390
Now, labs and
goldens, they might

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:26.710
have more of a history in
general with the water.

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:29.020
But you'll still find labs
and goldens that or not

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:30.700
into it or that are
not great swimmers

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:32.460
because they haven't had
the right experience.

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:34.043
And then you meet
these little clowns.

00:37:34.043 --> 00:37:35.300
And they're just dominating.

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:38.210
I mean, you got to remember too,
most dog breeds, pretty much

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:40.150
all dog breeds,
they're almost exactly

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:41.880
identical with they're genetics.

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.290
It's almost exact,
with minor differences.

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:45.260
The history's the same.

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.076
They're all coming from wolves.

00:37:47.076 --> 00:37:49.420
And obviously, there's a
lot of different things

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:52.650
that have happened along
the way over 20,000 years.

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:54.660
But most dog breeds
are fairly new.

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:58.100
And they're all pretty much
related, very closely related.

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:01.140
So the history's
almost the same.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.645
So even though
some of these dogs

00:38:02.645 --> 00:38:04.770
may have forgotten their
connection with the water,

00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:06.097
they can remember it.

00:38:06.097 --> 00:38:07.180
And it comes back to them.

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.346
All the time, I meet dogs
who have never been around

00:38:09.346 --> 00:38:10.930
water or just have a fear of it.

00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:12.990
But with the right
experience, and once

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:16.199
they can turn a curiosity into
confidence, they can dominate.

00:38:16.199 --> 00:38:17.990
I've met dogs who have
never been swimming.

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:19.365
And they come with
me in the pool

00:38:19.365 --> 00:38:21.890
and they dive down six
feet and they have a blast.

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:22.630
So that happens.

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:25.270
But I do have a poodle of my
own, a little poodle mix named

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:27.810
Nala who you will
not find in the book,

00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:30.590
except for in my author photo.

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:33.402
She's a great swimmer.

00:38:33.402 --> 00:38:35.610
She'll get in the creek and
look around a little bit.

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:37.240
But she doesn't have
a retrieve drive.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.880
And it's just her
number one hobby.

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:42.310
So my next book is actually
called, "Nala on the Couch."

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:44.290
And it's going to be 2000 pages.

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:46.695
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:48.339 --> 00:38:49.880
SETH CASTEEL: Here's
my little boxer.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:52.520
This is Prince, eight weeks old,
looks like an Olympic swimmer,

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.560
I think-- excellent form.

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:56.735
This is in Portland, Maine.

00:38:56.735 --> 00:38:57.700
These are my labs.

00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:58.750
These guys are my stars.

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:00.910
They started swimming
at six weeks of age.

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:03.710
And these guys are being kind
of prepped to be DockDogs.

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:05.500
Anybody familiar with DockDogs?

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:09.980
So DockDogs is a competition
for dogs and their humans.

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:12.630
It's all about
jumping off a platform

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:14.770
to see how far they
can go into the pool

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:16.010
and how high they can go.

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:16.990
And it's a lot of fun.

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:18.720
The dogs go crazy for it.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.970
I mean, it's a blast.

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:22.178
Some of the people are kind
of interesting, you know?

00:39:22.178 --> 00:39:24.749
You get the stage moms
that are like it's

00:39:24.749 --> 00:39:26.540
like they're little
ballerinas or something

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:29.000
like that or little actresses.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.360
But the dogs do love it.

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.660
They think it's hilarious.

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:34.060
And it's a very positive thing.

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.685
So these guys are
going to be DockDogs.

00:39:35.685 --> 00:39:37.340
At six weeks they
started swimming.

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:39.390
By nine weeks, they go
would show at the pool

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:41.800
and whine at the gate,
because they wanted to get in.

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.050
That's how much they liked it.

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:45.260
I met them at 10
weeks, 10 and 1/2.

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:46.180
It was a no-brainer.

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:47.960
They hadn't really
been underwater yet.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.144
But you know,
everything was in line.

00:39:50.144 --> 00:39:52.060
So I got to work with
all three of them, Reese

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:52.851
and Grits and Jack.

00:39:52.851 --> 00:39:54.752
You'll find all
three in the book.

00:39:54.752 --> 00:39:56.280
There they are with
the puppy teeth.

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:59.580
But even at 11 weeks, they start
to look a little bit older.

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:02.860
But the puppy teeth
tell it all for sure.

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:03.710
Here's these two.

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:06.136
I wanted to work with
all three underwater.

00:40:06.136 --> 00:40:09.130
I thought, wouldn't that be
something if we could do that?

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:12.030
But even though they live
with different people--

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:13.600
they all live in
Fort Myers, Florida.

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.897
They each live in
their respective home.

00:40:15.897 --> 00:40:17.480
But they spend a lot
of time together.

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.146
When that happens,
they're going to come

00:40:19.146 --> 00:40:23.105
across a hierarchy, who's the
boss and who's not the boss.

00:40:23.105 --> 00:40:23.980
It's going to happen.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:26.270
Anybody out there
have two dogs or more?

00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:29.280
Yeah, I mean, if you have two
dogs spending time together,

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.400
you'll figure out
who is the boss.

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.604
And this guy right here
can tell you that too.

00:40:33.604 --> 00:40:34.770
But that's how it goes down.

00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:36.590
And even if dogs are spending
a lot of time together,

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:37.924
they will establish a hierarchy.

00:40:37.924 --> 00:40:39.881
These puppies started to
establish a hierarchy.

00:40:39.881 --> 00:40:41.655
Jack, who you don't
see in this picture,

00:40:41.655 --> 00:40:44.050
is somewhere in the background,
looking for another toy.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:45.716
But he would not
compete with these two.

00:40:45.716 --> 00:40:47.299
He would not go under with them.

00:40:47.299 --> 00:40:49.090
These two were still
trying to duke it out.

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:50.557
Who is the boss, you know?

00:40:50.557 --> 00:40:52.140
So they would compete
with each other.

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:53.890
And I don't know
who the boss is.

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:56.223
I'm going to see them in a
couple weeks down in Florida.

00:40:56.223 --> 00:40:58.890
And I'm excited to figure out
who turned out as the champ.

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:02.000
But they're really funny,
diving down five feet

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.670
to the bottom of a
pool at 11 weeks.

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:05.591
I mean, that's a
shocking thing to see.

00:41:05.591 --> 00:41:07.840
And it's just like, I can't
believe this is happening.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.262
But I'm really happy
they're in there.

00:41:10.262 --> 00:41:13.540
Here's a behind the scenes
shot taken with a GoPro,

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.260
I think a HERO3 Black Edition.

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:17.010
And you'll just see
the quality, which

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:18.930
I think you see the details.

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:21.340
But you're kind of missing
some the illumination.

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:23.050
A lot of people
think I would shoot--

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:25.720
even all these Instagram
GoPro accounts, they always

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.490
tag my pictures, GoPro, GoPro.

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:30.480
And I'm like, I
didn't use a GoPro.

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:31.300
Stop doing that.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:32.545
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:32.545 --> 00:41:34.420
SETH CASTEEL: But this
is taken with a GoPro.

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:37.100
You can kind of see the
process of me underwater.

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:39.460
I'm in a wetsuit just because
I'm in the water so much.

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:42.666
And if you're in--
anybody a diver out there?

00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:43.790
Yeah, Andy, you're a diver.

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:46.470
So I mean, if you're
in water for-- say,

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:48.530
if you're in 80 degree
water for 10 hours,

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:52.640
you know, we're 98.6 degrees,
unless you've got a fever

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.940
or you're an alien.

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:55.990
But generally, you're
going to be 98.6 degrees.

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:57.680
And if you're in the water
for a long period of time,

00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.490
your core temperature
will drop over time

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:00.740
and you will get hypothermia.

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:01.823
And it affects everything.

00:42:01.823 --> 00:42:04.130
So sometimes I'm in
the pool for 14 hours.

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:06.140
Even if it's 85
degrees, you'd be

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:08.440
surprised how chilly you
get without a wetsuit.

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:09.530
So I wear a wetsuit.

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:12.170
And I'm also working with the
dogs at such close proximity

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:14.420
where you're going to get
scratched up because they're

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:15.545
trying to say hello to you.

00:42:15.545 --> 00:42:17.144
So I do wear that.

00:42:17.144 --> 00:42:18.560
But you'll see me
underwater here.

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:20.280
I'm just going
under with a ball.

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.880
And then here's the
same moment, almost.

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.120
Some of the shots with
underwater puppies you'll see

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.165
tennis balls or toys,
some of which you won't.

00:42:27.165 --> 00:42:29.040
Sometimes the tennis
ball falls out of frame.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.950
Like here it's in the frame
and then it's drifting down.

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:33.940
It's sinking down below.

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:34.780
And here's a shot.

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:37.254
The illumination, I think,
really comes into play here.

00:42:37.254 --> 00:42:39.670
You know, you couldn't have--
if all the shots in the book

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:42.660
were like this, I think it
would be a little boring.

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:43.580
The moment's cool.

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:45.930
But it's nice to be able to see
the details and the puppy teeth

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:46.980
and everything like that.

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:50.080
This is one of my
favorite shots though.

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:50.935
This is not a dog.

00:42:50.935 --> 00:42:52.086
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.680
SETH CASTEEL: This
is a baby, actually.

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:59.520
And I'm more of a dog guy,
and then cats, and then

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:03.052
like 100 other creatures,
and then maybe babies.

00:43:03.052 --> 00:43:04.510
And my publisher
right now is going

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:05.843
to watch this and get mad at me.

00:43:05.843 --> 00:43:09.690
But I've been working with
babies for the last four

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:10.400
or five months.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:13.950
I've photographed 750
human babies underwater

00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:16.280
in all kinds of states and
especially the big four,

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.280
which are California,
Arizona, Texas, and Florida.

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.804
I did an assignment for
"New York Times Magazine"

00:43:21.804 --> 00:43:23.220
called "Little
Nemos, Highlighting

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:25.530
the Importance of Water
Safety for Children."

00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:28.757
Drowning is the number one cause
of accidental death in children

00:43:28.757 --> 00:43:30.090
under five in the United States.

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:32.840
Between 500 and 700
children under five

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:35.612
drown, mostly in swimming
pools, mostly because there

00:43:35.612 --> 00:43:37.070
hasn't been proper
safety measures.

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:39.610
And also, the children are
not prepared for the water.

00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:42.999
Again, it's another serious
issue that can be prevented.

00:43:42.999 --> 00:43:44.040
I thought, you know what?

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:46.640
If I can bring my camera into
this and try to tell a story

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:50.610
and highlight some awareness
about the importance of water

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:52.360
safety for children, I'm OK.

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:53.830
I'm not doing a
book tour for this.

00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:56.020
I have no idea if any
books are going to sell.

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:59.380
But if we can improve
the awareness,

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:02.162
I think it's terrific,
even though I'm not a dad.

00:44:02.162 --> 00:44:03.620
I don't know if
I'll ever be a dad.

00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:05.540
But I did have an
amazing time working

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:07.727
with these little
creatures all around.

00:44:07.727 --> 00:44:09.810
But I'll tell you, at the
end of each photo shoot,

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:11.920
I wasn't trying to bring
one of them home with me.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.582
I'm happy to go
home and see my dog.

00:44:14.582 --> 00:44:16.790
But it was very inspiring
to watch these babies learn

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:19.990
such important life
survival lessons.

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:22.054
And a range of intensity--
some of the programs

00:44:22.054 --> 00:44:22.720
were more basic.

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:24.297
Some of them were very intense.

00:44:24.297 --> 00:44:26.130
But either way, it was
very, very productive

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:27.220
and very important.

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:28.970
We have a lot of
media lined up that's

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:30.386
going to promote
this next spring.

00:44:30.386 --> 00:44:33.129
The book will be out in
April of 2015, more or less.

00:44:33.129 --> 00:44:34.420
So that's what I've been doing.

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:38.319
That's bubbles and paws.

00:44:38.319 --> 00:44:38.860
What is that?

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:39.620
Anybody know?

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:40.890
Who can tell me?

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:41.807
Where's a guess?

00:44:41.807 --> 00:44:42.890
Anybody know what that is?

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:43.780
AUDIENCE: A tiger.

00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:46.390
SETH CASTEEL: It's a tiger.

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:49.620
So I have worked with
some exotic creatures.

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:50.590
This guy's pretty fun.

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:51.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:52.780
SETH CASTEEL: So I'm
working on a project called

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:53.850
Underwater Creatures.

00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:56.270
I may or may not make
a book out of it.

00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:58.897
I'm interested in
photographing types

00:44:58.897 --> 00:45:00.980
of animals you wouldn't
necessarily see underwater

00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:02.920
but still have a
connection with the water.

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:04.378
Whether or not I
could make a book,

00:45:04.378 --> 00:45:07.380
that's yet to be seen
with my publisher.

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:08.210
So I'd like to.

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:09.480
Little Brown, hey.

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:12.560
Let's get a book deal
on the horizon, huh?

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:15.780
But I'm really
fascinated with bringing

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:18.060
the message of helping
other types of animals

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:18.910
through photography.

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:21.300
It's funny and
shocking just what

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.050
a photograph can do
these days, especially

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:24.050
because of the internet.

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:26.300
You know, can bring a
message with a photograph

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:29.300
and you can touch a million
people or 100 million people.

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:31.092
Or now something like
over a billion people

00:45:31.092 --> 00:45:32.508
have seen the
"Underwater Puppies"

00:45:32.508 --> 00:45:33.890
pictures in the
last three weeks.

00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:34.849
That's a lot of people.

00:45:34.849 --> 00:45:36.223
But when you can
attach something

00:45:36.223 --> 00:45:37.910
that's positive about
it and important,

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:39.060
I think it goes further.

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.250
I mean, I love the that
the images are joyful

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:42.730
and they make people smile.

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:44.900
But it's cool to bring
a message to it also.

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:47.660
So I'd like to be able to
highlight all kinds of animals

00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:50.690
other than dogs and cats and
figure out how we can help them

00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:53.010
too by creating some really
interesting images of them

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:54.070
underwater.

00:45:54.070 --> 00:45:54.740
We'll find out.

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:57.230
Working with wild animals or
in captivity or in the wild

00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:58.890
is always a hot topic.

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:00.340
I've done it on both sides.

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:02.030
I've work with
animals in sanctuaries

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:04.380
to help raise money
for those animals.

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:05.930
I've also done it in the wild.

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:07.450
I've been criticized for both.

00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:08.780
So it's a tricky world.

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:10.886
You know, when I'm
photographing dogs at the pool,

00:46:10.886 --> 00:46:12.010
nobody really questions it.

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:14.290
But if you're in Alaska
photographing a bear that

00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:16.690
happens to come upon you, and
don't see him and you take

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:19.400
a picture, some people are
going to not like that.

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.536
So it's tough.

00:46:20.536 --> 00:46:21.660
But my intentions are good.

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:23.040
I would like to make the book.

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:25.300
I think it can make some
kind of a difference

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:27.450
for a lot of other
types of animals too.

00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:29.774
Anybody have any questions?

00:46:29.774 --> 00:46:31.440
AUDIENCE: I have a
dog that likes water.

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:33.440
But he keeps his
head above water.

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.420
How do you get them to
dive down like that?

00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:35.920
Sure.

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:38.541
So it's all based on the
classic game of fetch.

00:46:38.541 --> 00:46:39.040
Yeah.

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.042
So I basically start.

00:46:40.042 --> 00:46:41.250
I show up at the photo shoot.

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:41.950
I meet the dog.

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:43.390
We become pals.

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:46.870
And they have to know that
I'm the cool dude that's

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:47.900
at the pool.

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.370
They get familiar with the pool.

00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:51.620
It's all about them being
comfortable and trusting.

00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:52.930
We start to play fetch.

00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:53.990
We move it into the pool.

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:55.704
I have three games
I've designed based

00:46:55.704 --> 00:46:57.120
on the game of
fetch for the pool.

00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:58.453
One's called Bobbing for Apples.

00:46:58.453 --> 00:47:00.350
The dog comes onto the
stairs or the ramp.

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:02.450
I take the tennis
ball two inches

00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:04.890
under, three inches
under, five inches under.

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:08.400
And they start to put their nose
in. and then up to their eyes,

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.860
and then deeper.

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:12.760
Once they figure that game
out, we play swim and bob.

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.350
They basically swim with me.

00:47:14.350 --> 00:47:15.410
And I do the same thing.

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:16.460
They're swimming around with me.

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:17.200
And I have the ball.

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.020
We're all swimming out there.

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:19.430
And then I let the ball go.

00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:22.910
As a ball starts to sink,
they go under and I dive in.

00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:24.840
And I'm taking the
shots with them.

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:27.530
And then of course
the diving game-- one

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:29.280
of my most outstanding
underwater dogs

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.810
is dog named Rex, a boxer.

00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:34.010
I'll dive down to the bottom
of the pool, nine feet.

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:36.510
I'll hold his rocket
toy up like this.

00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:37.400
I'll wave it at him.

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:38.750
And I'm down there.

00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:39.340
He'll see it.

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:42.570
And he'll do a full swan
dive, dive all the way down,

00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:43.510
swim down at me.

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:45.510
And I'm taking the pictures
as he's coming down.

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:46.630
I hand him the rocket.

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:48.230
He grabs the rocket.

00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:50.355
Now we're both on the
floor of the pool, right?

00:47:50.355 --> 00:47:52.730
And I've got my weight belt
on to hold myself down there.

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:53.600
He doesn't have a weight belt.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:54.650
He just dived own.

00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:55.870
This dog is like a mermaid.

00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:57.380
I mean, it's crazy.

00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:58.757
So he's looking at me now.

00:47:58.757 --> 00:47:59.590
He's got the rocket.

00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:03.167
And he's just thinking, what
are you doing down here, guy?

00:48:03.167 --> 00:48:04.000
So then he looks up.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.040
And we're deep.

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.370
He looks up like this.

00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:10.040
And then he uses his hind legs
and he shoots off the bottom

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:11.690
back up to the top again.

00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:14.680
It's the craziest thing
I think I've ever seen.

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:16.374
But the pictures
are pretty cool.

00:48:16.374 --> 00:48:18.040
Yeah, I was so excited
to meet this dog,

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:21.737
I get two speeding tickets
in 40 minutes driving out

00:48:21.737 --> 00:48:22.570
to Lake Havasu City.

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:24.240
I would have went to jail.

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:26.830
The second cop was
like-- I was like, I just

00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:28.901
got-- you know, how is
this happening again?

00:48:28.901 --> 00:48:30.650
And I'm like, officer,
is there a problem?

00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:31.560
This is the second cop.

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.351
Is there a problem?

00:48:32.351 --> 00:48:34.977
And he's like, oh,
yeah, you were speeding.

00:48:34.977 --> 00:48:36.560
I'm like, no, there
must be a mistake.

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:38.060
I just got pulled
over for speeding.

00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:39.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:41.180
SETH CASTEEL: I didn't say that.

00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:42.300
He didn't know about
the first ticket.

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:43.840
I would have gone
to jail for that.

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.510
I mean, I'm like, listen man.

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:47.840
I just-- there's this dog
that I'm supposed to meet.

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:49.180
He's really cool.

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:50.830
And I was just excited about it.

00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:51.730
And he's like, what?

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:52.230
What?

00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:54.490
There's something
wrong with you, man.

00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:56.292
Get out of here.

00:48:56.292 --> 00:48:57.500
But it was worth it, I think.

00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:00.302
I got out there finally
and did the shots.

00:49:00.302 --> 00:49:01.010
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:02.439
You seem to keep
revisiting dogs.

00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:04.230
Is that because you're
re-shooting, or just

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:06.313
because you're checking
in, hanging out with them?

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:11.247
SETH CASTEEL: Well, dogs
are my number one, yeah.

00:49:11.247 --> 00:49:13.830
You mean, why do I keep working
with dogs over and over again?

00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:14.455
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:14.455 --> 00:49:16.084
SETH CASTEEL: That's my--

00:49:16.084 --> 00:49:18.500
AUDIENCE: Yeah, like you seem
to go back to the same dogs.

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:19.340
SETH CASTEEL: Oh,
visit the same dogs?

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:19.670
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:21.010
Like you've seen them when
they're a year and a half.

00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:22.426
SETH CASTEEL: I
have my favorites.

00:49:22.426 --> 00:49:23.130
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:23.670
SETH CASTEEL: I
have my favorites.

00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:25.066
I mean, I always meet dogs too.

00:49:25.066 --> 00:49:26.440
But there's some
dogs like Buster

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:29.130
I like to see from time to
time, Lulu the Jack Russell

00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:31.850
and Nevada the border collie.

00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:33.350
I mean, I have some
of my favorites,

00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:34.570
Rhoda the diving Dachshund.

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:37.007
These dogs have been such
a big part of my life

00:49:37.007 --> 00:49:38.340
because they've changed my life.

00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:41.460
So when I have an opportunity
to go back and see them again,

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:44.090
it's like the favorite thing
I could ever do, you know?

00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:45.410
I mean, they're like my family.

00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:47.204
So I like to go back
and swim with them

00:49:47.204 --> 00:49:48.370
and take some more pictures.

00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:50.040
And it's kind of fun.

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:54.280
AUDIENCE: So what's the
mechanics of the actual shoot?

00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:57.460
Do you hold your
breath for a long time?

00:49:57.460 --> 00:49:59.960
How do you deal with
your hands holding

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:01.959
the camera, your
strobes, so forth?

00:50:01.959 --> 00:50:02.750
SETH CASTEEL: Sure.

00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:03.920
AUDIENCE: How does at work out?

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:04.970
SETH CASTEEL: So
I'm in a wetsuit.

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:06.200
I'm holding my breath only.

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.457
A lot of people would
think that I'm a diver.

00:50:08.457 --> 00:50:09.790
I've actually never been diving.

00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:12.471
I'm not even certified to
dive, which is embarrassing

00:50:12.471 --> 00:50:14.970
considering how much money I
have in underwater camera gear.

00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:19.520
And I love the ocean and
I love sea creatures,

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:21.875
so I do plan to get certified.

00:50:21.875 --> 00:50:23.250
But yeah, I've
never been diving.

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:24.760
Actually, if I was
using dive gear,

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:27.160
it would get in the way
of what I'm trying to do.

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:29.220
Some of the photo
shoots, it's more simple.

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:30.750
I don't have to
move a whole lot.

00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:33.399
Some of the photo shoots,
I mean, if you're there,

00:50:33.399 --> 00:50:34.690
I'm zipping all over the place.

00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:35.550
So I'm diving down.

00:50:35.550 --> 00:50:36.880
I'm bouncing from side to side.

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.750
I'm swimming pretty
fast through the water.

00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:40.740
And that would
just weigh me down.

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:42.680
I mean, some of
these dogs are fast.

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:43.640
I've got the ball.

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:44.750
They want it, you know?

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:48.180
And I need to move pretty
quickly so I can set up

00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:50.020
the right opportunity
to take the picture.

00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:51.040
So I'm in a wetsuit.

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:51.820
I'm just holding my breath.

00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:52.280
I go under.

00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:54.071
Sometimes I wear a
mask, but most the time,

00:50:54.071 --> 00:50:57.050
I just open my eyes
and that's about it.

00:50:57.050 --> 00:51:00.280
I have my Ikelite underwater
housing set up with a 5D

00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:03.780
Mark III, a Cannon 8 to
15 fisheye, the L lens.

00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:06.560
And I had two DS161 strobes.

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.310
I hold my camera usually
with my right hand.

00:51:09.310 --> 00:51:11.185
And I have the tennis
ball with my left hand.

00:51:11.185 --> 00:51:12.809
So I'm just shooting
through the water.

00:51:12.809 --> 00:51:14.030
And I'll move it forward.

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:15.757
It weighs about
40 pounds on land.

00:51:15.757 --> 00:51:17.840
Underwater, it's not going
to weigh quite as much.

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.490
But I shoot through the water.

00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:22.530
And I always use this hand for
the tennis ball or the toy.

00:51:22.530 --> 00:51:24.280
And I use this hand
to hold onto that.

00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:26.410
And I just kind of
had to practice.

00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:28.700
But I'm moving fast, you know?

00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:31.220
Most of the images that you're
going to see in both books

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:33.970
are taken within about
12 inches of the camera.

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:37.010
And some of the dogs
are diving in fast.

00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:40.400
So I got to be very careful
with how I'm moving that gear.

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:43.450
But if you photograph several
thousand dogs and log thousands

00:51:43.450 --> 00:51:45.950
of hours in the pool, you
get the hang of it though.

00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:49.685
AUDIENCE: Have any of the dogs
ever broken any of your gear,

00:51:49.685 --> 00:51:50.670
being that close?

00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:52.420
SETH CASTEEL: You know
the answer to that.

00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:56.270
Yeah, I've lost a few
cameras over the years .

00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:57.680
It's all part of the fun though.

00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:58.721
It's all part of the fun.

00:51:58.721 --> 00:52:01.430
Yeah, I've had a dog actually
smash through my port, my lens

00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:04.540
port, this do named Cowboy.

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:06.840
And yeah, what a rascal.

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:07.885
But he was totally fine.

00:52:07.885 --> 00:52:10.176
He just wanted the ball and
he just went for it too far

00:52:10.176 --> 00:52:13.650
and just punched right through,
totally fine, the camera

00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:14.510
not so much.

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:17.814
It's amazing how fast-- if
you take a glass that's empty

00:52:17.814 --> 00:52:19.230
and you put it in
the water, watch

00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:21.170
how fast it fills with water.

00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:23.707
So he punched a clear
hole in this thing,

00:52:23.707 --> 00:52:25.290
and it's blub, blub,
blub, blub, blub.

00:52:25.290 --> 00:52:28.080
I had another dog in--
where was I? --San Diego.

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:30.120
And I was just not paying
attention that close.

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:33.477
And I'm supposed to lock on
the port onto my housing.

00:52:33.477 --> 00:52:35.060
You can put these
port locks on there.

00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:36.310
But sometimes it's a hassle.

00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:37.820
So I basically just put it on.

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:39.380
You twist it on.

00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:41.520
Now, if you twist it
off, it'll pop off

00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:43.100
and your whole thing will flood.

00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:47.360
So this dog was reaching
across with his little paw.

00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:50.897
And he grabbed the port and
he pulled it 90 degrees,

00:52:50.897 --> 00:52:52.230
just ripped the whole thing off.

00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:54.580
And that was a 5D
Mark III in there.

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:56.390
That's not a fun bill.

00:52:56.390 --> 00:53:00.480
I'm supposed to get insurance,
but I haven't done that yet.

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:03.050
I don't think anybody would
actually insure me anyway.

00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:05.621
They're all like, no, forget it.

00:53:05.621 --> 00:53:06.120
Cool.

00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:08.078
MALE SPEAKER: Alll right,
well, if we could all

00:53:08.078 --> 00:53:09.750
please thank Seth
for talking to us.

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:13.100
