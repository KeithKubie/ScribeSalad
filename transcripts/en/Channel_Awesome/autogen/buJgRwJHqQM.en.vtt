00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
really visually in the movie I thought
 

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
really visually in the movie I thought
they<00:10:41.400><c> captured</c><00:10:41.790><c> the</c><00:10:41.820><c> blindness</c><00:10:42.270><c> but</c><00:10:42.390><c> I</c>

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:42.450 align:start position:0%
they captured the blindness but I
 

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:43.970 align:start position:0%
they captured the blindness but I
thought<00:10:42.660><c> was</c><00:10:42.750><c> a</c><00:10:42.810><c> very</c><00:10:42.840><c> clever</c><00:10:43.410><c> way</c><00:10:43.620><c> to</c><00:10:43.650><c> show</c>

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
thought was a very clever way to show
 

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.220 align:start position:0%
thought was a very clever way to show
that<00:10:44.010><c> it</c><00:10:44.400><c> was</c><00:10:44.460><c> very</c><00:10:44.670><c> nicely</c><00:10:44.910><c> done</c><00:10:45.330><c> and</c><00:10:45.660><c> you</c><00:10:46.020><c> had</c>

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:55.850 align:start position:0%
blind yeah or even and I don't I don't
feel<00:11:54.089><c> like</c><00:11:54.210><c> the</c><00:11:54.330><c> performance</c><00:11:55.170><c> is</c><00:11:55.380><c> doing</c><00:11:55.650><c> it</c><00:11:55.770><c> as</c>

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
feel like the performance is doing it as

feel like the performance is doing it as

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:57.510 align:start position:0%

00:11:59.390 --> 00:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
more important to me is that I'm not
 

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.650 align:start position:0%
more important to me is that I'm not

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
saying it's a bad performance I actually
 

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.450 align:start position:0%
saying it's a bad performance I actually
think<00:12:00.870><c> it's</c><00:12:01.110><c> overall</c><00:12:01.890><c> a</c><00:12:02.010><c> very</c><00:12:02.100><c> good</c>

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
think it's overall a very good

think it's overall a very good

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:03.510 align:start position:0%

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:05.960 align:start position:0%

like yeah I kind of forget he's blind
there<00:12:14.339><c> sometimes</c><00:12:14.700><c> are</c><00:12:14.820><c> just</c><00:12:15.150><c> him</c><00:12:15.270><c> like</c><00:12:15.420><c> white</c>
