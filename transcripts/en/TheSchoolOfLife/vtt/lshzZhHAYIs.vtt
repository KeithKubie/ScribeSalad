00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.150
For approximately 80 years, the notion of
what a man should be like has been heavily

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:11.309
influenced by the idea of ‘cool’. The
cast of seductively cool figures includes:

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.329
Humphrey Bogart Jean-Paul Belmondo, Marcello Mastroianni,

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:18.030
James Bond, Bob Dylan, Ryan

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:24.000
Gosling and Benedict Cumberbatch The cool
man doesn’t try too hard, you don’t see

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.179
them floundering about in a panic – but
they succeed anyway. They are physically confident,

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.220
they can scale a mountain or saunter down
a deserted street in the middle of the night;

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.380
if they have to kill someone they will do
it neatly with minimal fuss; they don’t

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.440
worry, they are self-contained and sure of
themselves; their trousers are always a perfect

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.550
fit; they express themselves briefly – but
their words are always to the point; they’re

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.570
not meek in the face of authority; but they
don’t crave power themselves: they are independent.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.550
The essential characteristic of the cool man
is an aura of invulnerability, well handled:

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.489
without any showing off or bragging. When
the house is on fire, the cool man doesn’t

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.619
scream or call the fire brigade; ‘temperature’s
rising, baby’, he quips to his current girlfriend

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.840
as she emerges from the shower. Then he casually
puts out the blaze himself. When the waiter

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.979
spills a cocktail over him, the cool man doesn’t
get flustered; he removes his jacket and looks

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.380
even better in his shirt. When his boss is
being difficult, the cool man smiles ironically:

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.610
he can walk away from the job at any moment.
This is what, as a man, one is supposed to

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.710
be like. For decades some of the most astute
and creative minds have devoted themselves

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.671
to making this notion of masculinity attractive
– it’s been portrayed as enviable, seductive

00:01:42.671 --> 00:01:49.049
to women, and well-dressed. And the image
has worked: it’s what you need to be a real

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.610
man. And – perhaps daily – this model
of manhood tortures us with the gap between

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.150
its ideals – and our reality. THE WARM MAN
But there’s another – more realistic and

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.750
more important – vision of what a good man
is like that’s (comparatively) been given

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.910
very much less attention and creative encouragement.
This is the very opposite of the cool man,

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.430
what we call: the warm man. The warm man does
not put out many fires by himself. He hasn’t

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.910
killed anyone either. He is, instead, very
much alive to his own anxiety. He would drop

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.190
the gun and would tell you quite candidly
he had done so. What is distinctive, and admirable,

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.500
is his relationship to this anxiety. He is
aware of it, honest about it, funny with it

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.660
– and yet not overwhelmed by it. The warm
man has a good sense of how demented and fragile

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.830
we all are. So he goes out of his way to reassure,
to be forgiving and to be gentle. He has tried

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.750
very hard, at times, to get things to work
out better for himself but it frequently hasn’t

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.660
worked. The warm man has known many sorrows:
he has done stupid things, he has lost people

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.520
he loved, he has made daft decisions. His
weaknesses have made him immensely generous

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.940
to others. When the waiter spills the cocktail,
the warm hero laughs (he has spilled a few

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.300
himself) and leaves a generous tip if he can.
When he forgets someone’s name (which he

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.340
does quite often) the warm hero is ashamed
but frank and says – sincerely – ‘I’m

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.210
really sorry, and very embarrassed, but it’s
slipped my mind… forgive me, help me out…’

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.270
. When they’ve messed up at work, the warm
person admits it, feels sorry, openly apologises

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.280
and explains as best he can what actually
went wrong and how he might be put it right

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.820
in future. The essence of the warm man is
vulnerability well-handled; he is conscious

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.080
of his flaws and failings but uses this knowledge
to become interestingly humorous and a rich

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.960
source of sympathy for the secret troubles
of every life he encounters.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.200
Ideally, one day, it

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.760
will be as desirable to be called warm as
it currently is to be labelled ‘cool’;

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.600
there will be lists of the 40 warmest men
under 40; boys will come home from school

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.560
and complain to their mothers: ‘I can’t
do it, I can’t, I don’t know how to be

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.840
warm’; girls at fashionable bars will take
mental notes of where the warm guys are sitting;

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.600
and in the secret soul of every man there
will be a quiet, steady yearning to be as

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.560
warm as they possibly can.
