[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.070
NICK SHELTA: I'm
Nick Shelta, and I'm

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.040
one of the volunteers for the
Christian group at Google.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.550
And what we try to do is have
a monthly speaker series where

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.880
our goal is to bring in
speakers who answer questions

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.770
that Google can't answer.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.080
And so for this
month's talk, we've

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.170
invited Dr. Jeff Schloss
to come and join us.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.460
So I figured I would give
a brief intro to him,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.580
let you know a little
bit more about his work,

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.780
and then give it over to him for
the rest of the presentation.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.700
So Dr. Jeffrey Schloss
is a senior scholar

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.700
at the BioLogos Foundation
and a distinguished professor

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.970
and T.B. Walker chair of biology
at Westmont College, which

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.630
he also directs the Center for
Faith Ethics and Life Sciences.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.590
After his undergraduate studies
in biology and philosophy

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.320
on a solo programming,
cramming four years

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.790
of undergraduate
study into eight--

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.000
I'll let him explain that one--

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Jeff received his PhD in
ecology evolutionary biology

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.950
from Washington University.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.640
And has since been a Danforth
Fellow, a Crosson Fellow

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.520
at the University of Notre
Dame, a Plumer Fellow

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.460
at St. Anne's College at
Oxford, and a Witherspoon Fellow

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.140
in theology and science
at the Princeton

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.750
Center of Theological Inquiry.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.030
His current research focuses
on interactivity influence

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.260
human social cooperation.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.750
In his own work,
Jeff is especially

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.970
interested in helping
the Christian and secular

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.920
public appreciate the
emerging findings of science

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.630
and is fostering collegial
commerce between scholars

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.100
with differing and
no religious beliefs.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.105
Perfectly significant, and for
ways of keeping his own sanity,

00:01:40.105 --> 00:01:44.110
he includes his own interests
of surfing and sophomoric humor.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.181
With that said, I will give it
over to Jeff to tell us more.

00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:50.636
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:53.377 --> 00:01:55.210
DR. JEFF SCHLOSS: It's
great to be with you.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.430
This afternoon,
I want to explore

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.320
a centuries old conversation
that has sometimes

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.820
been synergistically
celebrative and sometimes

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.102
been acrimoniously polarizing.

00:02:10.102 --> 00:02:12.310
That's the conversation
between science and religion.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.540
And I want to begin by
telling you a story.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.500
And I hope it's OK to just give
you a little personal story

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.000
here.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.370
I'm holding my 3 and
1/2 year old son Gabe

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.140
in my arms one evening, and we
walk out the door to our house.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.619
We live in Santa Barbara.

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:29.410
We don't get great
sunsets in Santa Barbara

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.960
often because of
the maritime fog,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.070
but this sunset was spectacular.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.060
The sky was
hemispherically ablaze.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.510
I've never really considered
what it's like for a little kid

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.360
to notice something
for the first time

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.340
about the natural world
that we see all the time.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.710
But this was for the first
time Gabe noticed the sunset.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.640
And I'm holding him in my
arms, and his head turns to me,

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.790
his lips are quivering,
and he says, Daddy, look.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.035
God painted the sky.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.590
It was a touching, but kind of
a painful moment, because I had

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.100
to say, Gabe, that's stupid.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.900
God had nothing to do with it.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.080
That's just the differential
elastic scattering of light.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.560
No, of course, I
did not say that.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.110
But I tell you this story
to kind of illustrate

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.240
two points that we're going
to run with in this lecture.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.390
And the first one was,
well, was it stupid?

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.330
When we come up with a
naturalistic explanation

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.280
for things, does that
subvert the rational warrant

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.220
for thinking that there's
something beyond nature?

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.920
And the second
one is, well, Gabe

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.800
wasn't doing an
analysis and inference

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.990
to the best explanation.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.640
He saw this, and
he just immediately

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.590
intuitively
attributed it to God.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.230
So that second question is where
do these intuitions come from?

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.930
And over 300 years ago--

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.620
It's not working-- the
Scottish philosopher

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.590
David Hume says in his
"Natural History, of Religion",

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.660
is every inquiry
which regards religion

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.840
is of utmost importance,
there are two questions

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.740
in particular which challenge
our attention, to wit, that

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.829
concerning its
foundation and reason

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.649
and that concerning its
origin in human nature.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:23.190
Now for the last more
than three centuries

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.370
most of the discussion has
focused on that first one.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.190
What implications
does science have

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.530
for rational warrant,
the foundations

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.840
of religious belief in reason?

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.156
But recently,
actually just within

00:04:36.156 --> 00:04:37.530
the last several
decades, there's

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.310
been an explosion of research
into the second question.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.670
What is it in human nature,
if anything, that disposes us

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.430
to those kinds of beliefs?

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.090
And there have been
scholarly and popular studies

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.020
in genetics, neuroscience,
cognitive science,

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.120
and evolutionary theory.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.690
I want to concentrate on this
latter question with you.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.150
What is it in human
nature that seems

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.740
disposed to these
kinds of beliefs?

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.760
But in order to do that,
I need to set the context

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.250
in the first question,
foundations in reason.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.650
So there's a popular perception
that somehow the enterprises

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.080
of scientific inquiry
and religious faith

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.930
are intrinsically opposed.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.920
A few years ago, there was a
theme issue in Time Magazine.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.820
Richard Dawkins and Francis
Collins both weighed in.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.250
Francis Collins, the head
of the Human Genome Project

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.820
and now the director of the
National Institutes of Health,

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.060
he actually founded by BioLogos,
the organization with which I

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.580
have an appointment.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.070
But it's not just
popular controversy.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.890
So here's one of dozens
of quotes I can give you.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.380
This one from John
Dupre, formerly

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.440
up the road in the Department
of Philosophy at Stanford.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.460
Dupre says, Darwin undermines
the only remotely plausible

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.610
reason for believing in
the existence of God.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.060
There's nothing worthwhile left
of the argument from design

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.000
and more controversially
or contentiously.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.360
I want to insist that without
the argument from design,

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.960
there's nothing very credible
left of theism generally,

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.480
and Christianity in particular.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.640
Now I want to set
aside the question

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.220
of whether in fact the
rational warrant for faith

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.124
rests on the
argument from design.

00:06:25.124 --> 00:06:26.540
There are lots of
other arguments,

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.210
the argument from first cause,
and the cosmological argument.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.170
There are other reasons, for
example, first person testimony

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.180
or religious experience.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.840
Whether or not all of those are
adequate is another question,

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.650
but it's not clear that
faith ever rested entirely

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.200
on the argument from design.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.140
But more than that, I want to
look at this second comment,

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.510
that Darwin destroys the
argument from design.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.330
And it turns out there's
some merit to that,

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.770
but it's not that simple.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:04.130
There is a tradition of two
types of design attribution.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.720
One type looks at the natural
processes of the world.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.870
And in a sense, it reasons
from their deficiency,

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.270
says that natural
processes are not

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.280
able to account for
the observations

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.050
that we make in nature.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.170
And therefore, there must be
a supernatural intervenor.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.880
But there's another
tradition altogether

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.310
that looks not at the
deficiencies of nature,

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.840
but the marvelous
endowments of natural law.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.570
So Newton was speaking
in this tradition

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.240
when he said, the most beautiful
system of the sun, planets

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.430
and comets can only
proceed from the counsel

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.980
and dominion of an
intelligent being,

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.290
whom I call the Lord God.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.660
Now that might not be
an argument actually.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.460
It's an attribution.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.590
Maybe that's kind of
like Gabe and the sunset.

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:51.410
Maybe that was just a
response, an intuitive response

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:52.760
by Newton.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.940
Since him, however,
a number of arguments

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.829
have emerged called
fine tuning arguments.

00:07:57.829 --> 00:07:59.370
I'm sure you've
heard of them before.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.860
But looking at fundamental
constants of nature,

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.820
like the gravitational
constant, a number of others,

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.310
which couldn't have differed
by plus or minus more

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.730
than a few percent
in order to have

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.740
a life sustaining universe.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.760
Paul Davies, the
physicist at Arizona State

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.700
calls this the
Goldilocks enigma.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.190
One of my favorites is this one.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.800
It's not a constant
of a natural law.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.040
It's actually the initial
conditions on which laws work,

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.970
the initial mass
density of the universe.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:37.400
So this is from Ned Wright, UCLA
cosmologist and astrophysicist.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.990
And he posits that the initial
mass density of the universe

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:47.870
was fine tuned to one out of
10 to the 24th or a septillion.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.710
Actually, he's revised this
and added another digit.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.920
And one part greater,
and we would now

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.360
be living in the great collapse.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.000
In other words, we
wouldn't be living.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.080
And this notion of fine tuned
to one out of 10 to the 24

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:08.540
is approximately equivalent
to plus or minus one star

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.870
not in the night sky that
we see, or in our galaxy,

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.150
but in all the galaxies.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:19.421
And Hebrew scriptures
say, lift up your eyes

00:09:19.421 --> 00:09:20.420
and look to the heavens.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.500
Who created all these?

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.590
He who brings out our
starry hosts one by one

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:27.530
and calls forth each
of them by name,

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:29.630
because of his great
power and mighty strength,

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.680
not one of them is missing.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.200
And the Psalmist
says, he determines

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.080
the number of the stars and
calls them each by name.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.390
Now I want to be
really clear here.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:44.630
I am not suggesting, although
some of my coreligionists do,

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:48.620
that this was a prophecy of
what science would discover

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:53.310
thousands of years before the
sciences were even invented.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.660
I'm not positing that at all.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.930
I'm suggesting that what's
here in the scriptural view

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:02.400
of the world is that the world
is in fact a cosmos and not

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:07.080
a chaos, to use Greek notions.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.135
That the world and
the cosmos we live in,

00:10:09.135 --> 00:10:12.550
in fact, is structured
and designed.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.370
Not designed because
the laws require

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.830
supernatural
intervention, but designed

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:21.700
because the laws
themselves seem tuned

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:25.095
to what would be necessary
for the rise of life.

00:10:25.095 --> 00:10:26.470
And it's not just
the scriptures.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:30.370
So a number of scientists,
who have no faith in God

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:33.490
by the way, so Fred
Hoyle was an atheist who

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.620
said, a common sense
interpretation of the facts

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.440
suggests that super intellect
has monkeyed with physics as

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.220
well as chemistry and biology.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.520
And up the road here,
Leonard Susskind at Stanford,

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.320
co-developer of
string theory, says,

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.710
our own universe is
an extraordinary place

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.200
that appears to be
fantastically well designed

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.180
for our own existence.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.250
This specialness
is not something

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:58.380
that we can attribute to
lucky accidents, which

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.390
is far too unlikely.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:05.620
The apparent coincidences
cry out for an explanation.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.530
Now here, and each
of the major points

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:10.650
I want to make this
afternoon, here, I

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.610
need to interject a but.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.760
And it's a big but actually.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.130
This quote that I just
read you from Susskind

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.140
is often taken out of context.

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:23.390
Susskind does say that our
universe is a special place.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:26.650
But this quote is taken from
his book, the subtitle of which,

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:31.610
String Theory and the Illusion
of Intelligent Design.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.810
So he thinks our universe is
a remarkably special place,

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:37.390
but our universe isn't
the only universe,

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.680
that there are many,
many, many, many next door

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.120
universes greatly
amplifying the probability

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.050
that we'd get a universe
that would support life.

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.900
There are various permutations
of multiverse theory

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.735
or megaverse theory.

00:11:51.735 --> 00:11:53.110
And the point I
want to make here

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:58.590
is the question isn't settled.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:03.970
So the Book of Job actually,
I'm really moved by the fact

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.390
that in the Hebrew
scriptures, the Book of Job

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:10.340
contains friends of Job who
are giving arguments for God.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:14.130
At the end, they get rebuked
by God for defending him with,

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:17.040
quote, unquote,
"proverbs of ashes".

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.050
So I don't want to
make that mistake.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:22.060
These fine tuning arguments
aren't slam dunks.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.260
There's ongoing debate.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:28.070
But it's also not the
case that somehow Darwin

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:32.510
settled the issue and subverted
all arguments from design.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:36.230
One of my favorite thinkers,
Pascal, put it this way.

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:39.740
He says, there's enough light
to see that there's something

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.330
there worth seeing, but not
enough light to see it clearly

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.650
by our natural reason.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:49.980
He goes on to say, if
there were no obscurity,

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.110
man would not see feel his need.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:55.620
If there were no light, man
would not hope for a cure.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.910
All appearance indicates
neither a total exclusion

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:01.590
nor a manifest
presence of divinity.

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:03.720
We must not see nothing
at all, nor must we

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.450
see sufficient to believe
that we possess it.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.500
But we must see enough to
know that we have lost it.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:14.040
For to know of our loss,
we must see and not see,

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:18.310
and that's precisely the state
in which we naturally are.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.980
The picture here,
and I think this

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.740
is the picture of
the Christian faith,

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:27.850
is that you're not an
idiot for believing in God.

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:30.380
It's a plausible hypothesis.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:35.500
But what might persuade any
of us that there is a god

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:41.790
requires reason is necessary
but not sufficient.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.810
So this strange verse in the
book of Romans, Paul says,

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.180
his spirit testifies
with our spirit

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.720
that we are God's children.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.680
There's something about
the actual experience

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.050
of the presence of
God that's important.

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:59.230
That may be delusional,
but I think I'd rather

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:01.300
be delusional than dishonest.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.221
I don't want to defend God
with proverbs of ashes.

00:14:04.221 --> 00:14:04.720
OK.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.940
So now we have
this question then,

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.190
where do these
intuitions come from?

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:13.350
And here is the second part,
the origin in human nature.

00:14:16.397 --> 00:14:18.230
There's a couple of
ways of looking at this.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.440
Biologists talk about proximate
causes and ultimate causes.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.290
Proximate causes
would be the mechanism

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:29.830
that generates certain features
including mental dispositions.

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:35.681
And ultimate would be, well,
of what adaptive value, if any,

00:14:35.681 --> 00:14:36.180
is it?

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.690
So there's been a
tremendous explosion

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:42.530
in cognitive science of looking
at fundamental dispositions or

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:45.980
intuitive dispositions toward
certain kinds of beliefs

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.660
that we might associate with
God or religious beliefs.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.230
And by the way, one of
the really exciting things

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:55.220
about this field is it's
incredibly ecumenical.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:59.810
It has Jews and Christians
and Muslims and Jews who

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.830
are practicing, but
don't believe in God,

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.560
atheists, virulent and benign.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.720
We're all collaborating
with each other.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:12.490
It's a fun moment right now
of non-acrimonious discussion.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:20.890
So just for example,
Justin Barrett

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:27.970
is a cognitive science, formerly
at Oxford at the Institute

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:29.950
for Cognition and Culture.

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:43.270
And Jesse Bering is a sweet
spirited but very emphatic

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:43.790
atheist.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:47.570
Jesse says somewhat tongue in
cheek but not all together,

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:51.640
we've got God by the throat,
and I won't stop until one of us

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.150
is dead.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:56.280
So he's wrestling
with big issues.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.720
And here's some
work that Jesse did.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.390
It's on afterlife
beliefs in children.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:03.520
So we brings children
into the lab,

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.970
and he does a puppet show
with an alligator and a mouse.

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:08.540
And there's a story
about the mouse.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.780
The mouse wants to go home
to be with his mother,

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.900
and he's feeling a little
tired, and he's hungry.

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:17.860
And then the alligator
eats the mouse.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:21.790
And then the children are
sent off for grief counseling.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.350
No, that's not true.

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:28.270
The children are asked a
series of questions about

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:31.120
is there any continuity
between the mouse that was

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.650
and the mouse that now is?

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.870
And they're told the mouse
is not alive anymore.

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.170
The alligator ate it.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:40.840
So first of all,
biological questions.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.600
Does the mouse
still need to eat?

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.150
Still need to go
to the bathroom?

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.310
Do the mouse's ears still work?

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:49.690
And the overwhelming
majority of kids

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:52.450
get that at death your
biological functions

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:54.190
don't continue.

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:57.670
Although, kindergartens,
about a quarter of them, still

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.960
say yes to these questions.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.680
Second graders,
90% of them don't.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.990
Only one out of 10 says yes.

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.210
But then amp it up a little bit.

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:12.310
Psychobiological question, not
does the mouse need to eat,

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:13.940
but does the mouse
have the feeling

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.150
of being hungry,
thirsty, or sleepy?

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:20.900
On this one, two thirds of
the kindergartners said yes,

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:24.210
and fully a third of the
second graders say yes.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.390
And you have to get to
fifth or sixth grade

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:30.590
until you truncate
continuity, and about 90%

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:33.430
of the sixth graders said no.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.740
Now here's what's
really interesting.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.630
Lastly, a different
kind of question

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:42.670
altogether involving
desires and feelings.

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:44.950
Does the mouse still
want to go home?

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:46.840
Still loves his mom?

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:51.200
Mouse still believes that his
mom is the nicest grownup?

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:56.050
The overwhelming majority
of kindergartners are in.

00:17:56.050 --> 00:18:00.430
Fifth graders, half
of them say yes.

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:02.830
And what surprises
me a little bit,

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:05.170
he brought in college
students for this question.

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:08.020
And about a third of the college
students to the various items

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.600
said yes.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.880
And the ones that
said no, there was

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.260
a latency in their response.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.630
When asked about the
biological questions,

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.910
they said no immediately.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.020
When asked about the
beliefs, feelings,

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:27.150
and desires questions,
even the ones who said no,

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:31.040
there was a latency
in their answer.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:35.660
So the psychologist
at Yale, Paul Bloom,

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.320
an editor of the "Journal of
Behavioral and Brain Sciences",

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.740
uses the term natural
born dualists.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.710
Bloom believes that we're
not taught these things,

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:47.120
but there's a
natural disposition

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:51.200
to think of life as enduring
death maybe not altogether

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.950
embodied.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:53.910
Here's one other one.

00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:58.700
How about purpose?

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.510
The attribution of
purpose to things,

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:04.750
the inclination to
think teleologically.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:07.330
Deb Kelemen, the
psychologists have

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:10.910
looked at this
behavior in children,

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:14.910
and she asks questions like,
why did the first bird exist?

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:18.200
Well, to make nice music, and
because it makes the world

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.970
look nice.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.550
Why did the first monkey exist?

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:25.340
So then we had somebody
to climb trees.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:29.900
So there can be an
animal in the jungle.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:34.430
Why did the first monkey exist?

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:35.400
Oh, I already did that.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.800
Why did the first river exist?

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.010
So boats can come in the
water, and so that people

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.210
can do fishing.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:45.740
Kelemen calls children
intuitive theists.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.490
But the interesting
thing is she's

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:51.270
followed up on these studies
with adults, including

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:55.320
by the way, doctorally
trained academics, a number

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.870
in the natural sciences.

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.990
And there's still this
latent disposition

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:05.720
to think teleologically
in adults.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.570
Now what there isn't
there, these features

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:13.190
may a disembodied being
as in Jesse's work,

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:19.150
intuitive purpose,
orientation in Kelemen's work,

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:22.760
these are attributes of God.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:25.310
But when she calls
children intuitive theists,

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:28.250
the one thing that
is lacking there

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:33.950
that exists in most concepts in
the current world monotheisms

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:36.020
is a sacred dimension.

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:39.702
So these concepts could be
true of leprechauns for that.

00:20:39.702 --> 00:20:41.660
But there's something
about a sacred dimension,

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.780
and that's something that
hasn't been much studied

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.630
in the current cognitive
science of religion literature.

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:51.620
Nevertheless, it's surely true
that we have this disposition

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:52.940
to think in terms of purpose.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.640
Richard Dawkins
himself says, we humans

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.900
have purpose on the brain.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:01.220
The mere fact that it's
possible to frame a question

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.940
doesn't make it legitimate
or sensible to do so.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:10.490
You have no right to assume the
why question deserves an answer

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:13.210
when posed about a
boulder, misfortune,

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:16.510
Mount Everest, or the universe.

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:22.090
Now it's interesting
here, Dawkins

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:25.450
doesn't give a reason
why no one has a right

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.710
to ask that question.

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:29.820
He takes it as a given.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.850
And in fact, this
seems to emerge out

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:36.380
of a fundamental and profound
intuition on his part

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:38.110
that there is no purpose.

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:42.120
So in one sense, we have a
battling intuitions here.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.640
Although, it might seem
to you like, well, surely

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.250
we can't think of in terms
of a purpose of a mountain.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.290
But as we grow older,
it may be the case

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:56.310
that we are more parsimonious
in what we attribute purpose to,

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:59.410
but also more expansive
and elevating in terms

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:02.077
of how we construe purpose.

00:22:02.077 --> 00:22:04.660
So if you want to think in terms
of the purpose of a mountain,

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:08.440
for example, this isn't
a religious statement,

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.340
but I'd highly recommend
reading John Muir's

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.820
"The Mountains of California"
or his "My First Summer

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.170
in the Sierra".

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:22.260
There is a reverential
elevation of these entities

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:27.020
not just in an aesthetic
sense, but in some sense

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:30.404
in terms of a larger geology.

00:22:30.404 --> 00:22:30.904
OK.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.340
Whatever the case,
the cognitive sciences

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.290
suggest that we have
an innate disposition

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:47.570
to attribute, and not just
to attribute, but to yearn

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.930
for purpose.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:52.930
Augustine says, you have
made us for yourself.

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:57.440
And the heart is restless
til it finds its rest in you.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.040
Now the first question is
a theological statement.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.000
You have made us for yourself.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.270
The second question is a
psychological statement,

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:08.810
that our hearts are restless.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:10.970
And so why?

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:12.660
Why would that be the case?

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.390
And I want to take
a step back and ask

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:16.220
the evolutionary question.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:20.640
Why would creatures
have these dispositions?

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.790
Again, there's an explosion
of evolutionary literature

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:28.000
on cognitive dispositions
toward religious belief.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.270
There has been a fascinating
debate, by the way.

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:34.720
So some argue that we don't
have those dispositions,

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.230
that religion is a
cultural pathogen that

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:39.280
infects our brains.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.980
Richard Dawkins says,
religion is a virus

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.990
more deadly than
the smallpox virus,

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:46.720
but more difficult to eradicate.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.330
Others say, well, no.

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:53.140
Given the empirical work, there
may be cultural constructs,

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:56.200
but our brain is very
receptive to these.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:59.800
And in fact, our brain
is disposed to construct

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:04.860
these cultural notions,
but it's not adaptive.

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.080
It's a byproduct.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.170
It's an incidental byproduct
of other cognitive mechanisms

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:11.420
that do have adaptive function.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:14.060
And of course, a third
position in this debate

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:16.850
is it may be a byproduct,
but human culture

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:20.570
has learned how to
use these dispositions

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:22.920
for the flourishing of culture.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:27.920
Now I want to focus on this
last perspective, in part

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.890
because it's one that I've been
working on for the last decade.

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:34.200
But I actually think it would
be accurate to say that there's

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:38.510
emerging consensus in the
cognitive and anthropological

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:41.360
evolutionary
sciences of religion.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.590
So here we go.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.870
I'll set the context
with something

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:47.850
that virtually
everyone agrees on.

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:50.610
So here's an article from the
Philosophical Transactions

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:51.600
of the Royal Society.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:55.470
Human cooperation exceeds
that of all other species

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:58.380
with regard to the scale
and range of activities.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.900
Human beings cooperate
with individuals

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:04.500
that are not genetically
related and that

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:08.190
are outside the group
boundaries of face

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:12.780
to face historically
remembered interactions.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:17.280
And we're the only creatures
that do that systematically.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.290
40 years ago in his
seminal "Sociobiology",

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:22.290
E.O. Wilson says,
man has achieved

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:24.720
an extraordinary
degree of cooperation.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.470
Exactly how he alone has been
able to cross to this pinnacle

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:32.150
is the culminating
mystery of all biology.

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:34.250
Well, that was 40 years ago.

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:37.430
And this would be a
talk in and of itself,

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:41.450
but we've come up with
numerous fascinating

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:43.740
and really plausible
explanations for this.

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.970
But I'm going to
concentrate on one.

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:51.900
We'll start with this, it's
obvious that in human cultures,

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.440
and actually in other
social organisms,

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:59.180
a punishment is important.

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:02.450
So one of the aspects
of human cooperation

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:05.180
that is so difficult to
sustain, because it's

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:09.530
so open to infection, is not
me cooperating with Nick.

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:11.630
If I burn him, he
won't work with me.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:17.660
But it involves
common goods where

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:21.230
members of a large
community invest in and take

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:23.500
from a pool of shared resources.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:27.590
And the community can become so
large that you get free riders.

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.660
You get people who don't
make their investment,

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:34.310
or you get people who take
more than is their share.

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:38.080
Garrett Hardin called this
the tragedy of the commons.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.640
But punishment can
constrain this.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.090
So here's a common
goods game run

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:45.280
in the lab where
people are given

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.960
certain monetary endowment.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.550
You put it in the pool.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:52.330
It triples, and then you divide
it equally amongst everybody

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:54.460
in the game, including,
by the way, people

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.470
who didn't contribute anything.

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:58.540
And as you can see, people
figure out over time

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:01.080
that I'm getting burned
by these defectors,

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.510
and then investment in
the common pool goes down.

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:07.960
But admit punishment,
and it goes up.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:11.090
So punishment is really
effective in stabilizing

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:11.890
cooperation.

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:14.650
But there's some
limitations of this idea.

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:16.930
First of all, punishment costs.

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:20.320
And this particular game,
you had to pay to punish.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.020
But in societies
punishment costs.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:26.050
You confront somebody, they
might poke you in the nose.

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:27.910
We have to pay for policemen.

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:29.200
It's not free.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.510
And secondly, punishment
is only as good

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:36.040
as the detection
is of defectors.

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:39.790
So it's limited by the
accuracy of the detection.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:42.400
And then lastly,
punishers are bribable.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.680
They have their
own self-interests.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:48.160
So what we want, ideally,
to stabilize cooperation

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:54.990
in a society is a moral
overseer who is free,

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:58.970
who is omniscient,
and is unbribable.

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:01.320
Well, you see where
this is going.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:05.580
That's the posited
role of believing

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.450
in supernatural punishment.

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:12.330
So the notions here are the
rise of moralizing deities.

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:15.070
Which by the way, is
not all religions.

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:19.320
So some religions
propose deities

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.140
that are either not interested
in the affairs of humans

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.800
or are not viewed as
moral beings themselves.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.770
The rise of moral deities
seems to correspond

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:33.030
with the extension of the
size of human interaction

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:37.140
units and culture with
the rise of agriculture.

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:40.170
But this is certainly
not a novel proposal.

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:44.950
I mean, Voltaire, centuries
ago said, if God did not exist,

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:47.700
it would be necessary
to invent him.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:52.440
Now some people take this as
kind of a sarcastic repudiation

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.960
of God, that he was invented.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.520
But that's not what
Voltaire meant.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:01.110
Now he was a firm critic
of a number of aspects

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:02.340
of the Christian tradition.

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.340
But he went on to say,
when all nature cries out

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:07.500
that he does exist,
that there is

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.630
a supreme intelligence,
an immense power,

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:11.430
an admirable order,
and everything

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:18.850
teaches us our dependence on it
for reason of social coherence.

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:21.060
Now in the last
few years, there's

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.100
just been an eruption of
empirical literature testing

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.474
this hypothesis.

00:29:25.474 --> 00:29:26.890
And a couple of
books, by the way,

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:29.260
fun books are
Norenzayan's "Bid Gods

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:33.130
How Religion Transformed
Cooperation and Conflict",

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:36.310
and Dom Johnson's
"God is Watching You

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:39.250
How the Fear of God
Makes Us Human".

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:43.640
Dom has a dual PhD
in political science

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.220
and evolutionary biology.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.440
His appointment is at Oxford.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.170
And both these guys are
wonderful colleagues.

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:52.250
Both are atheists.

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:55.190
They have absolutely no
religious, pro-religious

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:58.730
agenda, but they're persuaded
that religious belief,

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:00.650
particularly belief
in moralizing gods,

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:06.700
has played a really crucial role
in the origin of human culture.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.440
And in fact, there's
some empirical data.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.130
I'll just share a
couple with you.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:13.845
This is from some
work that Ara did.

00:30:13.845 --> 00:30:14.720
He brought people in.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.160
They played the
dictator game where you

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.410
get a certain amount of money.

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:22.120
You can share as little or as
much with an anonymous partner.

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.800
And as they were doing that,
he gave them subliminal primes

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.330
on the computer.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:32.270
And when primed with a religious
concept, like spirit or God

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:39.570
or Bible, the offers
basically doubled.

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:43.830
Now he also used secular
police type crimes,

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:46.000
and it had the same effect.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:52.060
So no one's saying here
necessarily that religion

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.370
produces a greater impact.

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:56.590
It's just that there
may be other benefits

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.780
as a backup mechanism,
as a mechanism that

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:01.720
doesn't have to be paid for.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.450
But this is in the lab.

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:08.860
Is there any data to suggest
that it actually exerts

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:12.610
cultural or social influence?

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:15.900
And my colleague, Rich Sosis,
a evolutionary anthropologist

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:19.900
at University of Connecticut,
looked at historical records

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:23.290
for 200 religious
and secular communes

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:25.930
in 19th century America.

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:28.440
And he found that for every
year of their life course,

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.720
religious communes
were about four times

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.880
as likely to survive.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:37.320
So just the survival of
communes is tremendously

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:41.231
influenced by community
religious identity or lack

00:31:41.231 --> 00:31:41.730
thereof.

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:48.440
And there's Rich.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.990
Now there's limitations here.

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:54.560
And the limitations
here are, I mean, here's

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.790
a Gary Larson cartoon.

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:58.850
But this idea of a
punishing vengeful God

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:04.430
actually may be efficacious
in constraining defection.

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:07.400
But what it doesn't
seem to be able to do

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.040
is motivate supererogatory--

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:13.820
there's a word from
philosophical ethics--

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:16.400
motivate behavior that
goes above and beyond

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.380
the minimal expectations.

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:22.370
So this god might punish
you for doing wrong,

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:25.310
for violating what
you're obligated to do.

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:27.500
But we see people all
the time doing what

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.450
they are not obligated to do.

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:32.480
So you might think of
something dramatic like living

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:36.740
a life of poverty and celibacy
on behalf of serving the poor,

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:39.470
but it could also be something
just as simple as pulling over

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:42.680
in a snowstorm to
help a stranger

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:46.070
on the side of the road
who's run out of gas.

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:48.590
So one problem is
this doesn't explain

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:50.870
supererogatory behavior.

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:54.200
And another problem is any
society that relies exclusively

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:58.280
on belief in God to do
its moral policing is

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.650
vulnerable to
infection by people

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:03.020
who don't share that belief.

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:07.160
So here's the next and
current installment.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.480
It's called costly signaling.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:13.870
There's a long history
of biological thinking

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:16.780
about signaling in
non-human species.

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:21.130
But the idea here is that one
of the ways that a community can

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:24.820
assure itself that
interacting members in fact

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:27.830
do share in these
beliefs is by commitment

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:32.510
singling mechanisms, costly
behaviors, like for example,

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:36.400
taking one day off every
seven and not working,

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:41.860
or giving 10% of your income
voluntarily, or not eating

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:45.820
a whole range of food which
would otherwise be available.

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:48.780
Rich has gone back,
and he's actually

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:50.880
gone back to his
commune study and looked

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:55.200
at the number of
costly behaviors,

00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:00.270
and found that commune longevity
increased with an increasing

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:01.950
number of costly behaviors.

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:05.362
But by the way, only
for religious communes.

00:34:05.362 --> 00:34:07.380
It had no effect on
secular communes.

00:34:11.148 --> 00:34:13.860
Well, that's part of
the story, but there

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.980
are limitations of this, too.

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.520
And the limitations
are, number one,

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:22.860
for a costly
signal, whether it's

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:27.780
a peacock's tail or
a religious practice,

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.480
for it to be sustainable.

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:35.500
Although, it costs, it has to be
compensated for by the benefit

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.320
to the signaler.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:41.020
If it weren't, it
wouldn't be sustainable.

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:47.139
But now if the cost is
compensated for by the benefit,

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:49.389
then people who
don't believe would

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:51.250
be willing to pay the
cost, because they

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:53.590
get more out of it.

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:55.870
We see this, by the
way, at a lower level

00:34:55.870 --> 00:34:57.139
in American politics.

00:34:57.139 --> 00:34:59.860
It's almost impossible
to get elected

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:03.145
to major political office
if you're not a churchgoer.

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:13.230
I will forego a comment about
our current political situation

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:15.210
in the US.

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:17.200
But that's one problem.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:22.630
The other problem is this, the
costly signaling hypothesis

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:28.040
doesn't engage what is
a prominent teaching

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:32.090
in many religious traditions,
which is that what you do,

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:34.560
you shouldn't do publicly.

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.320
In the Christian
tradition, for example,

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.190
Jesus says, when you
give, don't give publicly

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:43.310
as the hypocrites do blasting
a trumpet before them,

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:44.465
but give in secret.

00:35:44.465 --> 00:35:46.070
In fact, don't even
let your left hand

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:48.370
know what your
right hand is doing.

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:52.620
And when you pray, don't pray
publicly as the hypocrites do,

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:55.620
but pray in secret
in your closet.

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.630
And your father
who sees in secret,

00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:59.940
will reward you in secret.

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:03.150
So there's this stream
of religious exaltation,

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:09.890
in fact, to not do exactly these
public displays of religiosity.

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:14.360
And that brings up the
last and final issue.

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:17.090
It's an issue I have
to say that is under

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:20.000
investigated right now.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.510
But it's the issue of
religious experience.

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:30.340
In order to motivate us toward
supererogatory behaviors, those

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:34.570
that we're not absolutely
obligated to do,

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:38.830
or in order to draw us into
religious practices that

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:43.930
don't enhance our reputation,
it might be the case

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:47.350
that whether it's
delusional or not,

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:49.540
a person who believes
that they experienced

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:52.740
the presence and
intimacy and love of God

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.970
might do these things.

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:57.100
So in the New
Testament, Paul says,

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:59.710
we comfort others
with the comfort

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:02.380
we ourselves receive from God.

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:06.190
The last few years,
my lab has been

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:08.830
looking at the relationship
between religious experience

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:13.420
and measures of pro-sociality,
trust and generosity.

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:16.930
I've been doing this
with Hillary Lenfesty,

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:18.670
now at the School
of Human Evolution

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:21.250
and Social Change
at Arizona State,

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:25.060
and Paul Zak from the Center
for Neuroeconomic Studies

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:27.220
at Claremont
Graduate University.

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:32.020
We have folks come into the lab,
take a series of inventories,

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:35.320
just where they self report
on their sense of gratitude

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.600
toward God, sense of
intimacy with God, belief

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:40.060
that they're loved by God.

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:43.060
Then we have them actually
do a variety of activities,

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.840
sometimes playing a game
or singing folk songs

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.790
or worshipping together.

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:53.560
We monitor their oxytocin,
which is a hormone that we know

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.110
mediates social relationship.

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:59.530
And then we have them play a
variety of economic transfer

00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:01.120
experiments,
standard experiments

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.190
in behavioral economics.

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:06.050
And here's what we found.

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:12.580
We found that generosity scales
to a sense of divine gratitude

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:14.560
and intimacy.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:17.710
We found that in
the activities, it

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:22.270
is enhanced by worship,
in particular highly

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:26.480
experiential or emotional
modes of worship.

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:30.880
And we have worked with people
from the Pentecostal tradition.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:35.200
And more tentatively, we've
found that generosity scales

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:39.640
to before and after oxytocin,
plasma oxytocin levels.

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:43.380
Although, we're still
analyzing that data.

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:46.710
Interestingly, in
most of these runs,

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:48.815
there have been no in
group, out group difference.

00:38:48.815 --> 00:38:50.190
So one of the
prevailing theories

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:54.270
of the social value of
religion is it tremendously

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:56.970
increases in group
commitment at the expense

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:58.860
of out group hostility.

00:38:58.860 --> 00:38:59.910
We haven't found that.

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:02.040
And a number of recent
studies actually

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:05.230
have taken a deeper look at
this in group, out group.

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:08.400
It turns out that there's
a large amount of research

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.230
that associates
religious commitment

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:17.250
with racial prejudice and
strong out group boundaries.

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:19.800
When we take a deeper
look, if we divide up

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.300
the religious
commitment into what's

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:24.660
called extrinsic and
intrinsic religiosity--

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:29.910
extrinsic involves kind of
conformity to extremal rules,

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:34.500
oftentimes for the sake
of personal benefit.

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:39.120
Intrinsic is an internalized
experience and commitment

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.220
to religious principles--

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:44.580
it turns out that
intrinsic religiosity

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:46.650
is associated with
a permeability

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:49.680
and relaxation of group areas.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.890
And intrinsic
religiosity is associated

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:57.060
with the rigidification
of group barriers.

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.890
OK.

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:03.940
So one last snapshot.

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:09.390
If in fact, we are disposed to
have certain kinds of beliefs,

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:12.730
and if in fact, those beliefs
and the practices associated

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:17.890
with them relate to
the establishment

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:24.200
of social coherence, is
there anything inside us

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:28.132
that would benefit and welcome
from and welcome those beliefs?

00:40:30.969 --> 00:40:32.510
So last couple of
decades, there have

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:36.670
been an explosion of literature
on religion and health.

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:41.420
This would be a talk
in and of itself,

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:43.220
but I want to give
you a snapshot.

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:46.630
And I'll close with a suggestion
for an interesting review

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:49.220
if any of you are
interested in it.

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:51.970
But there have been
over 3,000 studies.

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:54.730
The overwhelming
majority of which

00:40:54.730 --> 00:41:00.220
have associated various measures
of religious involvement

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:05.860
with cardiac and cancer and all
cause mortality a reduction,

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:08.830
measures of life
satisfaction, various measures

00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:13.750
of mental health, depression,
PTSD, even suicide.

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:16.290
And I told you each of my
points would have a but,

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:18.670
and there's a big but here.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:21.950
The but is many if not
most of these studies,

00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:24.850
while the correlations
are there,

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:30.250
were weakly designed, because
they were cross-sectional

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:32.710
rather than longitudinal.

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:36.970
They took particular
groups and scaled them

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:40.120
in terms of their religiosity,
but they didn't follow them.

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:42.980
And the problem
with that is this,

00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:46.100
if you have a correlation
between church attendance

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.862
and mental health
or physical health,

00:41:48.862 --> 00:41:51.320
we don't know whether church
attendance and the involvement

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:54.380
in community and
the meaning making

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:57.740
improves physical
or mental health.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:00.080
Or is it just the
case that people

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:05.400
with mental or physical ailments
are less likely to get out?

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:09.050
So a lot of these
studies have been flawed.

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:12.300
But in the last couple of years,
there have been some really,

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:16.820
really interesting well
done longitudinal studies.

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:23.190
I'll show you one from the
American Medical Association

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:26.100
Journal of Internal Medicine.

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:29.820
This study took 75,000
nurses and followed them

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:31.560
over 20 years.

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:35.580
They adjusted for age, alcohol,
smoking, educational level

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:37.320
of the individual
and their spouse

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:42.540
if they had one, exercise, diet,
vitamins, hypertension, body

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:46.780
mass index, depression, family
income, and even measures

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:49.320
of social integration,
adjusted for this

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.510
at the beginning of the study.

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:54.690
And then just monitored
church attendance

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:59.250
on questionnaires
submitted every four years.

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:05.520
And it turns out that there was,
in those who attended church

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:09.810
once or more a week,
there's a 33% reduction

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:15.220
in all cause mortality
over this 20 year period.

00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:18.240
Now why would this be the case?

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:21.450
We can take a look at that
in the questions section

00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:23.380
if anybody wants
to discuss that.

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:28.020
But since this study, there
have been a great number

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:32.790
of other concomitant
variable controlled,

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:34.890
long term, longitudinal
studies that

00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:40.020
have found similar outcomes for
various measures of physical

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:42.324
and psychological health.

00:43:42.324 --> 00:43:43.740
And I'll just
mention that there's

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:48.990
a really wonderful review of
this work a few months ago

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:51.990
in the "Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences",

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:55.410
one of the most prestigious
scientific journals there is.

00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:58.500
This work was done by
Tyler VanderWeele, who

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:02.160
has joint appointments in the
Department of Epidemiology

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:06.930
and Biostatistics at the
Harvard School of Public Health.

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:10.440
Tyler has been very critical of
a lot of the previous studies.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:14.070
But in this review
paper, he looked only

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:17.610
at longitudinal
studies that controlled

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:19.770
for concomitant variables.

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:21.720
And the reason I'm
recommending it to you

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:25.310
is because it's not just
on religion and health.

00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:29.130
It's on the promotion
of human flourish.

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:32.870
So he looks at various measures
of human flourishing, which

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:35.900
include statements of
emotional happiness,

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:39.890
stability of personal
relationships,

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:44.530
physical health, and some
sense of meaning in one's life.

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:50.200
And he reviews literature in
four areas, family structure,

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.320
education, work, and
religious involvement,

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:54.970
and finds that all
of these things

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:57.640
make substantial
causal contributions

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:00.110
to human flourishing.

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:05.450
So to close, none of
this makes religion true.

00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:10.390
In fact, it doesn't even make
religion uniformly beneficial.

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:12.960
There are negative
gods beliefs that

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:16.530
have demonstrably toxic effects
on individual and social

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:18.610
flourishing.

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:23.820
But what this does
represent is the questions

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:30.450
represent fascinating areas of
open minded scientific inquiry.

00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:33.840
Some of these people, I
mentioned Dom Johnson and Rich

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:37.350
Sosis, I've had the
privilege of collaborating

00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:38.490
with for many years.

00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:40.470
Dom's an atheist.

00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:43.350
Rich is a practicing
Jew, though I don't

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:45.600
know whether he's a theist.

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.400
I'm a Christian.

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:50.370
We have fantastic
fun with each other.

00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:53.220
And it's a fascinating
area of study

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:57.660
in which I think it represents
right now not conclusions

00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:03.300
looking for evidence, but
questions really looking

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:04.900
for answers.

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:07.770
But in addition to
being an area that's

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:12.660
fun for open minded
scientific inquiry,

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:15.930
I think it's one worthy of
existential inquiry as well.

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:20.760
So I'll close with a quote
from Pascal who I began with.

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.230
The God of Christians
is not a God

00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:25.230
who is simply the author
of the mathematical truth

00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:27.510
or the ruler of the elements.

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:30.180
He's not merely a God who
exercises his providence

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:32.580
over the life and
fortunes of men.

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:36.170
The God of Christians is the
God of love and of comfort,

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:38.760
a God who fills the soul
and the heart of those whom

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.620
he possesses, a
God who makes them

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:43.800
conscious of their
inward waywardness

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:49.480
in his infinite mercy who unites
himself to their inmost soul,

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.440
and who fills it with humility
and joy with confidence

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:56.624
and love, who renders them
incapable of any other end

00:46:56.624 --> 00:46:57.165
than himself.

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:03.482
Thank you very much.

00:47:03.482 --> 00:47:07.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:07.750
NICK SHELTA: Yeah.

00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:08.541
Thank you for that.

00:47:08.541 --> 00:47:11.426
You condensed a
lot into 45 minute.

00:47:11.426 --> 00:47:14.220
And lastly, it does give us
15 minutes for questions.

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:16.230
And we can go a
little bit overboard.

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:19.720
So I will pass around the
mic in case anyone has here.

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:21.330
And we do have a Dory online.

00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:23.380
I'll actually rotate
between questions on that.

00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:25.380
And any of you live
streaming, if you

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:28.380
do want to ask a question,
our Dory is at GofafDory.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:34.180
First, does anyone have an
opening question from the room?

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:37.090
If not, actually I
had a question myself.

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:41.080
So I remember getting reference
of a study that kind of went

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:44.620
along against the idea
of faith and flourishing.

00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:47.020
It was, I believe,
a Denmark study

00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:49.590
that was talking about
how people were there,

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:52.090
and I guess it goes back to the
flourishing report, of being

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:55.690
more happy and all that, and
how people outside of the realms

00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:58.420
of religion are linked to that.

00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:00.102
So do you have any?

00:48:00.102 --> 00:48:01.060
DR. JEFF SCHLOSS: Yeah.

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:02.180
I'm glad you asked.

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:07.490
And I told you from the start,
these are complicated issues.

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:11.320
I'm nervous about
oversimplifying.

00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:12.920
But let's take a look at that.

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:21.990
OK.

00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:25.770
So here, this is an
international survey.

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:27.330
The percentage
saying that religion

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:30.210
is important in their
daily life versus what's

00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:31.960
the quality of your life today.

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:35.460
One is from, well
it shouldn't be one.

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:39.420
It should be 10, very best,
one is the worst possible.

00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:42.750
And Denmark is at
the top, and it's

00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:48.030
one of the least religious
cultures on the planet.

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:51.930
Togo is way down at the bottom,
and it's highly religious.

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:55.090
By the way, this isn't
just true internationally.

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:59.150
So if we look at
emotional well being,

00:48:59.150 --> 00:49:04.270
this a Gallup poll with
no particular ax to grind,

00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:08.490
and religious
attendance by state.

00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:11.640
There's a negative relationship.

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:16.390
And it's also true
with life expectancy,

00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:19.790
a negative relationship.

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:22.150
So here's my comment.

00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:25.470
First of all, these
studies actually

00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:27.510
suffer from the
same weakness that I

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:31.410
said other correlational
studies suffer from.

00:49:31.410 --> 00:49:34.740
They're not controlling
for concomitant variables.

00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:42.870
So it may in fact be the
case that for various reasons

00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:49.400
as the default standard of
living as a society rises,

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:55.910
the religiosity goes down, but
health and happiness goes up.

00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:58.770
We call that can
concomitant variability.

00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:02.390
The other possible
problem with these studies

00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:03.920
is that they
represent what's been

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:06.260
called the ecological fallacy.

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:12.290
Ecological fallacy is
sampling at the wrong scale.

00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:14.300
And by the way, my
initial training

00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:15.560
was in ecology actually.

00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:17.330
And the size of
the sampling unit

00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:18.830
made all the
difference in what we'd

00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:20.400
find in terms of
correlation with

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:23.490
the environmental variables.

00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:27.260
So and I want to thank the
social psychologist David

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:31.420
Meyers for this, if we
look at a different scale,

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:35.410
if we look at the individual
scale here in the US,

00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:38.000
we get the exact opposite.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:44.230
We have increasing happiness
with a just church attendance.

00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:48.520
And we get the same relationship
with life expectancy

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:50.830
if we look at the
individual scale.

00:50:50.830 --> 00:50:52.360
So with respect
to those studies,

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:55.840
I don't want to dismiss
them too cavalierly,

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:59.050
but they're not
longitudinal, and they

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:01.930
don't control for
concomitant variables,

00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:04.540
and they may suffer from
the ecological fallacy.

00:51:07.566 --> 00:51:09.190
NICK SHELTA: Well,
I do have a question

00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:10.450
that came in out of Dory.

00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:13.270
And this is from Grace
from Sydney, Australia.

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:16.000
She said, it's awesome to hear
the ways that science and faith

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:16.990
intersect.

00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:20.380
But I also wanted to hear how
people argue that humans just

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:22.090
think they need religion.

00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:23.050
We cannot know.

00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:26.140
How can we know that we are
wired for the evidence of God's

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:28.090
intelligent design,
or is religion

00:51:28.090 --> 00:51:29.310
a result of how we are wired?

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:36.120
DR. JEFF SCHLOSS: Well,
that's the big question.

00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:41.020
So we might subdivide
it into two questions.

00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:43.590
The first one is an
empirical question.

00:51:43.590 --> 00:51:45.690
Does it look like humans--

00:51:45.690 --> 00:51:48.000
by the way, I
wouldn't say wired.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.630
Because wired suggests
that it's in our hardware,

00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:56.700
and that somehow it's
absolutely innate,

00:51:56.700 --> 00:52:00.120
and that no matter what
context we grew up in,

00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:01.710
we have these dispositions.

00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:03.840
I don't think that's the case.

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:06.270
Biologists describe
phenotypes as gene

00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:08.490
by environment interactions.

00:52:08.490 --> 00:52:11.010
So one is the
empirical question of,

00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:15.240
are we disposed to believe
certain things growing up

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:18.570
in environments that are
typical human, family,

00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:20.700
and cultural
environments that are

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:24.120
typical of the natural
history of our species?

00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:25.245
And I would say we.

00:52:25.245 --> 00:52:27.750
We are disposed to
do those things.

00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:29.850
And then the next
question is, OK,

00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:35.850
as we construct and imbibe
those kinds of beliefs,

00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:38.610
are we not only
disposed to hold them,

00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:41.940
but do they make a positive
difference in our life?

00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:44.580
I'd say here the
data are complicated,

00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:46.800
depends on the nature of
the beliefs, and the way

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.600
we embrace them.

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:52.590
But the data seem pretty robust
that certain kinds of beliefs

00:52:52.590 --> 00:52:55.560
and behaviors held
in certain ways

00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:58.470
contribute to a flourishing
at both individual and social

00:52:58.470 --> 00:52:59.370
levels.

00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:03.000
Now our friend in
Australia, question

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:07.020
is, OK, so do we have
the beliefs because we're

00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:11.790
wired to generate them,
or do we have them

00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:18.184
because there is a creator
who wired us to have them?

00:53:18.184 --> 00:53:20.600
Well, that's not a question
that's empirically answerable.

00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:22.620
Is it?

00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:26.730
What we can say is, contrary
to a number of the folks

00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:32.610
I cited here is, it doesn't look
like from the empirical data

00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:36.360
there's anything that
would subvert that belief.

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:39.180
But the design argument
itself, whether it's fine

00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:41.940
tuning of the cosmos
or whether it's fine

00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:45.120
tuning of the human
cognitive architecture,

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:47.550
I'm going to go back
to Pascal on this.

00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:50.220
There's enough light to see
that there's something there

00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:54.240
worth seeing, and not enough
light to see it clearly.

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:59.110
And Pascal says that that's
actually a good thing.

00:53:59.110 --> 00:54:01.530
Because if we came
to belief in God

00:54:01.530 --> 00:54:04.770
by purely rational
imprints, we'd

00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:08.480
believe in God as a proposition.

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.150
And he says, if we
have this hunch,

00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:13.660
this question that there might
be a God, and we come to God

00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:18.460
and ask him, are you there, and
have an interaction with him,

00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:21.100
then we have a God who is
a relational loving being.

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.520
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the talk.

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:27.530
So I have a question
regarding these studies,

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:30.790
and a little bit think mean
you kind of alluded to it, just

00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:32.230
the confounding factors of it.

00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:34.870
So you mentioned that, yes,
there were cross sectional

00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:36.540
and some were
longitudinal, right,

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:38.170
but 20 years is a long time.

00:54:38.170 --> 00:54:41.060
And you normalize
in the beginning,

00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:43.450
but if you keep going to
church, perhaps you'll

00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:46.810
find a group of people that you
enjoy being with and a husband.

00:54:46.810 --> 00:54:49.390
And we know those
factors actually

00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:51.510
are affecting your
level of happiness.

00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:56.690
So how do you explain that,
not so much genetics, but also

00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:58.960
the effect of the
environment and how

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:00.880
that interacts with religion?

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:04.880
DR. JEFF SCHLOSS: So
this was a 20 year study.

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:07.924
I mean, I'm a little
overwhelmed at that

00:55:07.924 --> 00:55:09.590
at the scale of this
study, because it's

00:55:09.590 --> 00:55:12.020
75,000 people over 20 years.

00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:14.450
And they actually went
back every four years

00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:18.560
and checked with them and
adjusted for covariates.

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:21.110
So that graph I
showed you at the end

00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:25.490
was a graph not of the
actual mortality data,

00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:28.190
but a model of
the mortality data

00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:32.420
once these other covariates
had been adjusted for.

00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:35.960
So we need more
studies like that.

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:39.210
But now the next question
would be, well, why?

00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:41.010
What's going on here?

00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:49.440
And they did what's
called mediating analysis.

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:53.240
And it looked like that
even after controlling

00:55:53.240 --> 00:56:01.300
for covariance, it looks
like social inclusion was

00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:05.740
an important factor,
and optimism and hope

00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:07.490
was an important factor.

00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:09.550
And that differed
between the two groups,

00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:12.420
longitudinally studied.

00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:14.740
Now one question we
might ask is, OK, well,

00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:18.070
if we had something other than
religion that would contribute

00:56:18.070 --> 00:56:22.480
to folks' sense of social
inclusion and buoyancy

00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:26.380
or optimism, could that
perform a similar function?

00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:27.940
And maybe so?

00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:31.580
AUDIENCE: Maybe they should
look in Denmark, maybe

00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:34.070
like a place like Denmark
where people are--

00:56:34.070 --> 00:56:36.200
I mean, I'm not saying or
displaying a little bit,

00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:39.020
but Denmark would be a
place where people maybe

00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:43.370
have that hope because socially,
the situation is not as dire.

00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:46.150
So if you go to Togo,
there's not much there.

00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:48.496
Well, I mean, there is stuff,
but you know what I mean.

00:56:48.496 --> 00:56:49.870
DR. JEFF SCHLOSS:
Yeah, for sure.

00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:50.590
Yeah.

00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:53.920
AUDIENCE: Sometimes it's
the feeling of belonging

00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:55.760
can mediate that effect, too.

00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:57.110
DR. JEFF SCHLOSS: Yeah.

00:56:57.110 --> 00:57:01.760
So yeah, we do need more
international studies

00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:02.720
of these things.

00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:05.600
Here in the US, there
have been a number

00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:09.791
of studies that have targeted
different cultural groups as

00:57:09.791 --> 00:57:10.290
well.

00:57:10.290 --> 00:57:11.810
So a number of
studies have looked

00:57:11.810 --> 00:57:13.700
at just the effects,
one study looked

00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:16.250
at just the effects of
religious involvement

00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:20.280
on coronary heart disease in
African-Americans, for example.

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:24.512
So a different social group with
different social challenges.

00:57:27.284 --> 00:57:29.880
NICK SHELTA: So we did have
one more question in the Dory.

00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:33.774
And it was actually about just
definitions of flourishing.

00:57:33.774 --> 00:57:35.190
I think this was
in reference back

00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:37.800
to your slide of talking about
oxytocin and measuring it.

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:40.110
So I think that what
they were trying to ask

00:57:40.110 --> 00:57:44.370
is, what is your definition
of flourishing personally?

00:57:44.370 --> 00:57:47.430
And is there a definition
that science can give us

00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:49.590
of what is exactly
human flourishing

00:57:49.590 --> 00:57:52.591
and where would be the
intersection of the two?

00:57:52.591 --> 00:57:54.840
DR. JEFF SCHLOSS: Well, I'll
start with the first one.

00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:59.010
I'd be really nervous if we
relied on science to tell us

00:57:59.010 --> 00:58:01.860
what human flourishing is.

00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:04.650
The sciences do two
things, don't they?

00:58:04.650 --> 00:58:08.640
They attempt to rigorously
describe regularities

00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:10.570
in the natural world.

00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:13.360
And then they attempt to
generate causal explanations

00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:16.180
for those regularities.

00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:19.690
So in Aristotelian
terms, science

00:58:19.690 --> 00:58:22.930
proposes efficient
causes of things.

00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:25.750
Aristotle also talked
about final causes.

00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:30.520
He talked about the ends for
which things are constructed.

00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:33.760
And his notion of nature,
for example, of human nature

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:37.530
or the nature of anything
was highly teleological,

00:58:37.530 --> 00:58:39.790
that we had a particular end.

00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:45.250
And in his view, and in the view
probably of most of us here,

00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:50.650
if there is an end, if
there is a normative telos,

00:58:50.650 --> 00:58:55.060
and we miss it, well,
that's called tragedy,

00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:59.740
or in physical context,
it's called illness.

00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:03.340
But science can't
decide what that end is,

00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:06.190
nor, contra Dawkins,
can it decide

00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:08.690
whether there is such an end.

00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:16.010
So my definition of
flourishing, in my own life,

00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:17.510
well, even before
I was a Christian,

00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:22.130
I thought that
ultimately flourishing

00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:26.150
was to have a matrix of intimate
and loving relationships

00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:30.290
with other folks with
whom I could be myself,

00:59:30.290 --> 00:59:32.660
they could be
their selves to me,

00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:37.120
and for whom we would be
invested in one another.

00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:41.920
But, speaking
autobiographically,

00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:44.890
and I am so grateful
I've had that in my life,

00:59:44.890 --> 00:59:46.780
but that wasn't enough.

00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:50.260
And I actually construe
ultimate flourishing

00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:52.270
in the Augustinian terms.

00:59:52.270 --> 00:59:55.280
You have made us for
yourself, and the heart

00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:58.080
is restless til it
finds its rest in you.

00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:05.610
That flourishing is loving
embrace of and by our creator

01:00:05.610 --> 01:00:07.570
who made us specifically
for that end.

01:00:10.642 --> 01:00:11.350
NICK SHELTA: Wow.

01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:12.480
Thank you for that.

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.290
DR. JEFF SCHLOSS:
Great to be with you.

01:00:13.290 --> 01:00:15.165
On that note, join me
in a round of applause.

01:00:15.165 --> 01:00:18.270
[APPLAUSE]
