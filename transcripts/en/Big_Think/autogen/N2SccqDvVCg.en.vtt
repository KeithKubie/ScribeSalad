work it can I mean if you stop to think

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489
work it can I mean if you stop to think
 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.850
work it can I mean if you stop to think
about making an etching when you realize

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860
about making an etching when you realize
 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.320
about making an etching when you realize
you have a plate of metal and you have

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330
you have a plate of metal and you have
 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.180
you have a plate of metal and you have
to make little scratches then you have

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190
to make little scratches then you have
 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.590
to make little scratches then you have
to fill a little ink and then you have

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600
to fill a little ink and then you have
 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.070
to fill a little ink and then you have
to put some damp paper on top of it and

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080
to put some damp paper on top of it and
 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.689
to put some damp paper on top of it and
given all of that you can still produce

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699
given all of that you can still produce
 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.329
given all of that you can still produce
the most extraordinary things you

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339
the most extraordinary things you
 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.760
the most extraordinary things you
realize that limitation materials and

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:04.770
realize that limitation materials and
 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.310

about the fact that statistically if you
 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.610
about the fact that statistically if you
get a thousand pieces you're likely to

get a thousand pieces you're likely to
 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.400
get a thousand pieces you're likely to

my experience with all this sort of free
work and general calls for submission is

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830
work and general calls for submission is
 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.570
work and general calls for submission is
that they produce very low-level

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580
that they produce very low-level
 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.460
that they produce very low-level
responses it is also a real exploitation

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470
responses it is also a real exploitation
 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.710
responses it is also a real exploitation
of the innocent and people are so

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720
of the innocent and people are so
 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.170
of the innocent and people are so
desperate to find a way of becoming

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180
desperate to find a way of becoming
 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.259

one of the curious things that happens

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120
one of the curious things that happens
 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.880
one of the curious things that happens
in the field is that because our

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890
in the field is that because our
 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.780
in the field is that because our
activity is linked to the arts and the

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790
activity is linked to the arts and the
 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.550
activity is linked to the arts and the
arts are not supposed to be concerned

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560
arts are not supposed to be concerned
 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.150

with money after all money is impure
it's not fine there is strength amount

it's not fine there is strength amount
 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.599
it's not fine there is strength amount
of inquiry about free work you can as I

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609
of inquiry about free work you can as I
 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.670
of inquiry about free work you can as I
probably have in the last two weeks you

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680
probably have in the last two weeks you
 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.969
probably have in the last two weeks you
can get 20 calls from people who want

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979
can get 20 calls from people who want
 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.460
can get 20 calls from people who want
and expect you to do something without

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470
and expect you to do something without
 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.480
and expect you to do something without
being paid for it because of visibility

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490
being paid for it because of visibility
 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.460
being paid for it because of visibility
or because you're not supposed to be

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470
or because you're not supposed to be
 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.290
or because you're not supposed to be
interested in money well that's not

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300
interested in money well that's not
 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.279
interested in money well that's not
exactly the case and so it is a I think

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289
exactly the case and so it is a I think
 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.040
exactly the case and so it is a I think
fundamentally exploitive you wouldn't go

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050
fundamentally exploitive you wouldn't go
 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.560
fundamentally exploitive you wouldn't go
into a butcher shop and ask for a pound

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570
into a butcher shop and ask for a pound
 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.350
into a butcher shop and ask for a pound
of steak without anticipating that you

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.660
 
well that's a complex question I mean it

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670
well that's a complex question I mean it
 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.950
well that's a complex question I mean it
the question of the degree of skill and

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960
the question of the degree of skill and
 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.370
the question of the degree of skill and

classicism and anyone's makeup is it
 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.570
classicism and anyone's makeup is it
depends very much on context

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580
depends very much on context
 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.330
depends very much on context
and capacity how many people have

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340
and capacity how many people have
 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.520
and capacity how many people have
different attitudes it is possible to be

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530
different attitudes it is possible to be
