with Stacy Coleman in which we were

with Stacy Coleman in which we were
 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.260

relevance of grief reactions then we
 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.109
relevance of grief reactions then we
concluded that the evidence was

concluded that the evidence was
 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:14.969
concluded that the evidence was
generally consistent with the view with

generally consistent with the view with
 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.550
generally consistent with the view with
the DSM's view of bereavement and that

that's really I think an opinion I held

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860
that's really I think an opinion I held
 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.290
that's really I think an opinion I held
at the time pretty clearly I thought

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300
at the time pretty clearly I thought
 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.420
at the time pretty clearly I thought
well that's makes sense to me but

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430
well that's makes sense to me but
 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.430
well that's makes sense to me but
unfortunately it didn't unfortunately I

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440
unfortunately it didn't unfortunately I
 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.590
unfortunately it didn't unfortunately I
said should say it didn't really hold up

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600
said should say it didn't really hold up
 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.800
said should say it didn't really hold up
for example a number of reviews began to

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810
for example a number of reviews began to
 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.750
for example a number of reviews began to
appear showing that grief treatments

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760
appear showing that grief treatments
 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.390
appear showing that grief treatments
were generally not effective and one of

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400
were generally not effective and one of
 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.130
were generally not effective and one of
these appeared after another in quick

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140
these appeared after another in quick
 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.290
these appeared after another in quick
succession and that really got a lot of

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300
succession and that really got a lot of
 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.800
succession and that really got a lot of
attention if one review appears says

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810
attention if one review appears says
 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.240
attention if one review appears says
grief treatments are not effective in

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250
grief treatments are not effective in
 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.800
grief treatments are not effective in
academic community though the mental

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810
academic community though the mental
 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.840
academic community though the mental
health community will wonder about it

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850
health community will wonder about it
 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.370
health community will wonder about it
but one after another was saying it's

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380
but one after another was saying it's
 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.560
but one after another was saying it's
really not effective and one of the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570
really not effective and one of the
 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.060
really not effective and one of the
reasons seem that they really weren't

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070
reasons seem that they really weren't
 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.140
reasons seem that they really weren't
the right treatments they were not

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150
the right treatments they were not
 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.180
the right treatments they were not
targeting grief symptoms they were

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190
targeting grief symptoms they were
 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.300
targeting grief symptoms they were
targeting either depression or PTSD so I

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310
targeting either depression or PTSD so I
 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.790
targeting either depression or PTSD so I
was at a number of panels and we really

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800
was at a number of panels and we really
 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.890
was at a number of panels and we really
began to think about this so we decided

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900
began to think about this so we decided
 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.420
began to think about this so we decided
to ask the question empirically our

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430
to ask the question empirically our
 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.410
to ask the question empirically our
grief symptoms clinically relevant is

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420
grief symptoms clinically relevant is
 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.369
grief symptoms clinically relevant is
there more

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379
there more
 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.559
there more
to grieve than depression and PTSD and

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569
to grieve than depression and PTSD and
 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.239
to grieve than depression and PTSD and
in the language the research language we

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:24.249
in the language the research language we
 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:26.190
in the language the research language we
would say this grief have incremental

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200
would say this grief have incremental
 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.110
would say this grief have incremental
validity if we have depression

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120
validity if we have depression
 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.089
validity if we have depression
and we have PTSD trauma reactions do we

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099
and we have PTSD trauma reactions do we
 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.740
and we have PTSD trauma reactions do we
need anything more do we need something

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750
need anything more do we need something
 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.080
need anything more do we need something
called grief to explain those things so

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090
called grief to explain those things so
 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.640
called grief to explain those things so
we came up with a number of different

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650
we came up with a number of different
 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.119
we came up with a number of different
studies this is the design of one so it

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129
studies this is the design of one so it
 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.369
studies this is the design of one so it
soon after the loss a few months after

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379
soon after the loss a few months after
 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.559
soon after the loss a few months after
the loss we had people go through a

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569
the loss we had people go through a
 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:44.699
the loss we had people go through a
structured interview we measure

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709
structured interview we measure
 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.369
structured interview we measure
depression we measure PTSD symptoms

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379
depression we measure PTSD symptoms
 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.559
depression we measure PTSD symptoms
trauma symptoms and grief symptoms then

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569
trauma symptoms and grief symptoms then
 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.839
trauma symptoms and grief symptoms then
we had people rated independently by

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849
we had people rated independently by
 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.369
we had people rated independently by
clinicians for the functioning we did

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379
clinicians for the functioning we did
 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.289
clinicians for the functioning we did
that again in another interview we had

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299
that again in another interview we had
 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:56.910
that again in another interview we had
their friends rate how well they were

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920
their friends rate how well they were
 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.860
their friends rate how well they were
doing we looked at their heart rate

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870
doing we looked at their heart rate
 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.690
doing we looked at their heart rate
responsility when they talked about the

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700
responsility when they talked about the
 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.569
responsility when they talked about the
loss etc nobody repeated this again a

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579
loss etc nobody repeated this again a
 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.839
loss etc nobody repeated this again a
little over a year later so we had lots

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849
little over a year later so we had lots
 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.130
little over a year later so we had lots
of different measures this was actually

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140
of different measures this was actually
 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.259
of different measures this was actually
a fairly rigorous way to test this so

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269
a fairly rigorous way to test this so
 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.330
a fairly rigorous way to test this so
does grief symptoms to the idea of grief

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340
does grief symptoms to the idea of grief
 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.699
does grief symptoms to the idea of grief
bias anything well the answer was

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709
bias anything well the answer was
 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.460
bias anything well the answer was
resounding yes yes yes yes yes and all

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470
resounding yes yes yes yes yes and all
 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.440
resounding yes yes yes yes yes and all
fronts and this was as I said a fairly

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450
fronts and this was as I said a fairly
 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.809
fronts and this was as I said a fairly
rigorous test so we found that grief

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819
rigorous test so we found that grief
 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.520
rigorous test so we found that grief
symptoms predicted current and future

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530
symptoms predicted current and future
 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.110
symptoms predicted current and future
adjustment the predicted heart rate

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120
adjustment the predicted heart rate
 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.119
adjustment the predicted heart rate
response they predicted what their how

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129
response they predicted what their how
 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.440
response they predicted what their how
the friends thought people were doing

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450
the friends thought people were doing
 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.750
the friends thought people were doing
over and above depression of PTSD this

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760
over and above depression of PTSD this
 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.879
over and above depression of PTSD this
is really strong evidence and I was kind

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889
is really strong evidence and I was kind
 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.830
is really strong evidence and I was kind
of amazed by this it really said wow

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840
of amazed by this it really said wow
 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.170
of amazed by this it really said wow
there was something that's in grief that

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180
there was something that's in grief that
 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.830
there was something that's in grief that
is not in these other disorders so we

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840
is not in these other disorders so we
 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.270
is not in these other disorders so we
did it in another study we found the

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280
did it in another study we found the
 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.650
did it in another study we found the
same thing in another study with a new

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660
same thing in another study with a new
 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.420
same thing in another study with a new
sample different measures you know we

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430
sample different measures you know we
 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.830
sample different measures you know we
really tried to do this as

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840
really tried to do this as
 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.140
really tried to do this as
scientifically rigorously as we could

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150
scientifically rigorously as we could
 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.949
scientifically rigorously as we could
and we found again the same thing the

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959
and we found again the same thing the
 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.270
and we found again the same thing the
other thing that emerged so we know

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280
other thing that emerged so we know
 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.800
other thing that emerged so we know
there's something unique about grief

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810
there's something unique about grief
 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.599
there's something unique about grief
that's not depression in PTSD the other

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609
that's not depression in PTSD the other
 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.069
that's not depression in PTSD the other
thing that was beginning emerges that

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079
thing that was beginning emerges that
 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.720
thing that was beginning emerges that
treatments were actually more effective

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730
treatments were actually more effective
 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.879
treatments were actually more effective
when they were targeting grief symptoms

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889
when they were targeting grief symptoms
 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.159
when they were targeting grief symptoms
and targeting prolongs grief giving

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:05.169
and targeting prolongs grief giving
 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:06.809
and targeting prolongs grief giving
people some time to get a better on

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819
people some time to get a better on
 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.610
people some time to get a better on
their own and then finding out who was

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620
their own and then finding out who was
 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.569
their own and then finding out who was
not functioning well and dr. shear did a

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579
not functioning well and dr. shear did a
 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.819
not functioning well and dr. shear did a
study of 2005 in JAMA published in JAMA

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829
study of 2005 in JAMA published in JAMA
 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.129
study of 2005 in JAMA published in JAMA
that really was the first major study

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139
that really was the first major study
 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.129
that really was the first major study
that targeted bereavement grief symptoms

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139
that targeted bereavement grief symptoms
 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.990
that targeted bereavement grief symptoms
specifically with the treatment designed

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000
specifically with the treatment designed
 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.879
specifically with the treatment designed
for that and this was really big news

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889
for that and this was really big news
 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.110
for that and this was really big news
because it said alright there is

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120
because it said alright there is
 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.790
because it said alright there is
something we can get it we can help

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800
something we can get it we can help
 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.219
something we can get it we can help
people by specifically targeting grief

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229
people by specifically targeting grief
 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.000
people by specifically targeting grief
so in a lot of the research I do is

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010
so in a lot of the research I do is
 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.589
so in a lot of the research I do is
Janette mentioned we study resilience we

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599
Janette mentioned we study resilience we
 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.390
Janette mentioned we study resilience we
studied other prototypical trajectories

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400
studied other prototypical trajectories
 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.640
studied other prototypical trajectories
we follow people over time large groups

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650
we follow people over time large groups
 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.920
we follow people over time large groups
of people and map their outcomes and

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930
of people and map their outcomes and
 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:41.129
of people and map their outcomes and
we've

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139
we've
 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.020
we've
this was war we've done this with all

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030
this was war we've done this with all
 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.059
this was war we've done this with all
kinds of ents and a lot of this research

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:45.069
kinds of ents and a lot of this research
 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:47.489
kinds of ents and a lot of this research
with bereavement so we have these

00:04:47.489 --> 00:04:47.499
with bereavement so we have these
 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:48.959
with bereavement so we have these
different patterns of outcome that we

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:48.969
different patterns of outcome that we
 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:51.149
different patterns of outcome that we
can match some people are resilient some

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:51.159
can match some people are resilient some
 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:53.159
can match some people are resilient some
people recover some people show more

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169
people recover some people show more
 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:54.839
people recover some people show more
complicated reactions here's an example

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:54.849
complicated reactions here's an example
 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:56.459
complicated reactions here's an example
of one of those studies published in

00:04:56.459 --> 00:04:56.469
of one of those studies published in
 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:59.969
of one of those studies published in
2002 this was a large population sample

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979
2002 this was a large population sample
 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:01.499
2002 this was a large population sample
that we followed for about seven years

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:01.509
that we followed for about seven years
 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.659
that we followed for about seven years
and we had measures before and after

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669
and we had measures before and after
 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.369
and we had measures before and after
this is depression but we also did this

00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:05.379
this is depression but we also did this
 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:07.170
this is depression but we also did this
with grief symptoms and you can see

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180
with grief symptoms and you can see
 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.239
with grief symptoms and you can see
there is a group there that just doesn't

00:05:09.239 --> 00:05:09.249
there is a group there that just doesn't
 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:10.529
there is a group there that just doesn't
get any better they're not they're doing

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539
get any better they're not they're doing
 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.290
get any better they're not they're doing
fine before the loss then they they they

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300
fine before the loss then they they they
 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.939
fine before the loss then they they they
get worse and they they're not able to

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949
get worse and they they're not able to
 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:18.029
get worse and they they're not able to
get better so we have these kinds of

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039
get better so we have these kinds of
 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:20.580
get better so we have these kinds of
patterns then the question becomes so

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590
patterns then the question becomes so
 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.379
patterns then the question becomes so
what's going on what causes these

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389
what's going on what causes these
 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.260
what's going on what causes these
different groups to to branch out like

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270
different groups to to branch out like
 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.730
different groups to to branch out like
this why doesn't everybody get better

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740
this why doesn't everybody get better
 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.920
this why doesn't everybody get better
the same way and this is why a center

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930
the same way and this is why a center
 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.480
the same way and this is why a center
like this is so important because we can

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490
like this is so important because we can
 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.579
like this is so important because we can
begin to try to answer that question so

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:32.589
begin to try to answer that question so
 

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:34.499
begin to try to answer that question so
everybody's trying to adapt to loss and

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:34.509
everybody's trying to adapt to loss and
 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:36.629
everybody's trying to adapt to loss and
some people are doing it better than

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639
some people are doing it better than
 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.839
some people are doing it better than
others so we've been looking at emotion

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:39.849
others so we've been looking at emotion
 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:41.399
others so we've been looking at emotion
regulation something we call emotion

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409
regulation something we call emotion
 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:43.769
regulation something we call emotion
regulation flexibility this is a project

00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:43.779
regulation flexibility this is a project
 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:46.399
regulation flexibility this is a project
we're doing in my lab across the street

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:46.409
we're doing in my lab across the street
 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:48.269
we're doing in my lab across the street
there are lots of streets that people

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:48.279
there are lots of streets that people
 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:49.980
there are lots of streets that people
talk about being across that we're

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990
talk about being across that we're
 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.879
talk about being across that we're
talking about that one over there and

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889
talking about that one over there and
 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:55.350
talking about that one over there and
we're doing part of this in

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360
we're doing part of this in
 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.760
we're doing part of this in
collaboration with dr. Sheeran

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770
collaboration with dr. Sheeran
 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.589
collaboration with dr. Sheeran
intervention studies and we're doing it

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:58.599
intervention studies and we're doing it
 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:00.839
intervention studies and we're doing it
also in many other ways it's based on

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:00.849
also in many other ways it's based on
 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:02.850
also in many other ways it's based on
the idea that at adapting to these

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860
the idea that at adapting to these
 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.139
the idea that at adapting to these
aversive life events requires

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:04.149
aversive life events requires
 

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:07.350
aversive life events requires
flexibility this is a an emergent idea

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360
flexibility this is a an emergent idea
 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.659
flexibility this is a an emergent idea
and we've identified three components of

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669
and we've identified three components of
 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.269
and we've identified three components of
flexibility being sensitive to context

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:12.279
flexibility being sensitive to context
 

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:14.820
flexibility being sensitive to context
having a repertoire of responses and

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830
having a repertoire of responses and
 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.249
having a repertoire of responses and
being able to monitor feedback and this

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:17.259
being able to monitor feedback and this
 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:18.809
being able to monitor feedback and this
is the same thing as what I just

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:18.819
is the same thing as what I just
 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:20.820
is the same thing as what I just
described I'll show you graphically so

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830
described I'll show you graphically so
 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.320
described I'll show you graphically so
we have a stressor event in this case a

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330
we have a stressor event in this case a
 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.019
we have a stressor event in this case a
loss there's impinges upon us something

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:25.029
loss there's impinges upon us something
 

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:26.850
loss there's impinges upon us something
happens to us and we are now thrown off

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860
happens to us and we are now thrown off
 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.980
happens to us and we are now thrown off
for disequilibrium so we have to

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990
for disequilibrium so we have to
 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.379
for disequilibrium so we have to
appraise what this means what is this

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:31.389
appraise what this means what is this
 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:33.240
appraise what this means what is this
demanding of us what do we have to do to

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250
demanding of us what do we have to do to
 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.579
demanding of us what do we have to do to
recover from this event and people vary

00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:35.589
recover from this event and people vary
 

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:37.499
recover from this event and people vary
and how well they can do this so we call

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:37.509
and how well they can do this so we call
 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:40.409
and how well they can do this so we call
this context sensitivity then after

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:40.419
this context sensitivity then after
 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:42.839
this context sensitivity then after
people make those appraisals they have

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:42.849
people make those appraisals they have
 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:44.700
people make those appraisals they have
to enact a strategy they have to decide

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710
to enact a strategy they have to decide
 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.980
to enact a strategy they have to decide
how they're going to respond to this

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990
how they're going to respond to this
 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.290
how they're going to respond to this
kind of event and people vary in their

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.300
kind of event and people vary in their
 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.089
kind of event and people vary in their

more elaborate repertoire
 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:56.600
more elaborate repertoire
of coping responses and others some

of coping responses and others some
people you know sometimes we need to

00:06:58.249 --> 00:06:58.259
people you know sometimes we need to
 

00:06:58.259 --> 00:06:59.929
people you know sometimes we need to
express emotions sometimes we need to

00:06:59.929 --> 00:06:59.939
express emotions sometimes we need to
 

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:02.360
express emotions sometimes we need to
suppress emotion or talk or not talk or

strategy we need to monitor it we need

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:12.089
strategy we need to monitor it we need
 

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:13.909
strategy we need to monitor it we need
to just find out how is this working is

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919
to just find out how is this working is
 

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:15.799
to just find out how is this working is
this doing what we hoped it would do and

00:07:15.799 --> 00:07:15.809
this doing what we hoped it would do and
 

00:07:15.809 --> 00:07:18.469
this doing what we hoped it would do and
should we maintain the strategy adapt

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479
should we maintain the strategy adapt
 

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:21.379
should we maintain the strategy adapt
adjust it try something new et cetera

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:21.389
adjust it try something new et cetera
 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:24.049
adjust it try something new et cetera
and we do this in a long-term event like

00:07:24.049 --> 00:07:24.059
and we do this in a long-term event like
 

00:07:24.059 --> 00:07:26.239
and we do this in a long-term event like
bereavement we do this over and over and

00:07:26.239 --> 00:07:26.249
bereavement we do this over and over and
 

00:07:26.249 --> 00:07:29.089
bereavement we do this over and over and
over we repeat this cycle many times so

00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:29.099
over we repeat this cycle many times so
 

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:32.559
over we repeat this cycle many times so
what we found in our laboratory research

00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:32.569
what we found in our laboratory research
 

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:35.360
what we found in our laboratory research
early on people who are not as sensitive

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:35.370
early on people who are not as sensitive
 

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.129
early on people who are not as sensitive
to the context and we can measure this

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:37.139
to the context and we can measure this
 

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:40.100
to the context and we can measure this
experimentally are more likely to show

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.110
experimentally are more likely to show
 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:41.659
experimentally are more likely to show
that complicated grief pattern whereas

00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:41.669
that complicated grief pattern whereas

people who are more sensitive or more
 

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:45.559
people who are more sensitive or more
likely to recover and then later on

00:07:45.559 --> 00:07:45.569
likely to recover and then later on
 

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:47.389
likely to recover and then later on
we're finding that people who already

00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:47.399
we're finding that people who already
 

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:49.639
we're finding that people who already
have developed complicated grief who are

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:49.649
have developed complicated grief who are
 

00:07:49.649 --> 00:07:52.999
have developed complicated grief who are
who lack a repertoire of coping

00:07:52.999 --> 00:07:53.009
who lack a repertoire of coping
 

00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:54.829
who lack a repertoire of coping
responses those are the people that will

00:07:54.829 --> 00:07:54.839
responses those are the people that will
 

00:07:54.839 --> 00:07:56.959
responses those are the people that will
continue to suffer so this is just the

00:07:56.959 --> 00:07:56.969
continue to suffer so this is just the
 

00:07:56.969 --> 00:07:58.219
continue to suffer so this is just the
beginning of this kind of research it

00:07:58.219 --> 00:07:58.229
beginning of this kind of research it
 

00:07:58.229 --> 00:07:59.899
beginning of this kind of research it
took 10 years to do it but it's just the

00:07:59.899 --> 00:07:59.909
took 10 years to do it but it's just the
 

00:07:59.909 --> 00:08:02.540
took 10 years to do it but it's just the
beginning and there's a lot of work that

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:02.550
beginning and there's a lot of work that
 

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.850
beginning and there's a lot of work that
can be done so this this kind of work

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:04.860
can be done so this this kind of work
 

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:05.989
can be done so this this kind of work

certain courses are followed and what we

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:40.260
certain courses are followed and what we
 

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.040
certain courses are followed and what we
can do about it so this Center I think

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:43.050
can do about it so this Center I think
 

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:44.809
can do about it so this Center I think
is really important in that regard thank

00:08:44.809 --> 00:08:44.819
is really important in that regard thank
 

00:08:44.819 --> 00:08:56.550
is really important in that regard thank
you
