00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.130
So, in particular, the way I heard you write it down was that

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:10.070
A must consider the sort of worst case counter strategy by B right?

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.330
&gt;&gt; I see, because when A chooses the row, then B was going to

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.150
make things bad for A along that row, so that's the counter strategy you mean.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.910
&gt;&gt; Right, and in fact, when you try to do it the other way with B. Well,

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.720
B has to do the same thing. B has to consider the worst case counter, as well.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.440
And in this particular case, the way we set it up.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.070
Where the values for A. A is always therefore trying to maximize.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.410
And B is always trying to minimize A. Which works out

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.100
to be the same thing as maximizing itself. Does that make sense?

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah! I mean, other than the fact that, you know, I name

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.795
my first child Max. I really wanted to name my second child Min.

00:00:43.795 --> 00:00:47.640
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That actually would have been pretty cool. Why didnt you do that?

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.720
&gt;&gt; Because I'm married to someone with more sense then i have.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah i understand, i completely understand. Okay so, A is

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.510
trying to maximize B is trying to minimize they both have

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.140
to consider the worst case that the other will do. And

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.930
so whats thats going to is going to force them through exactly

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.270
the same process you went through. We just figure, I'm going to

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.630
make the choice so that my opponent makes the counter choice,

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.920
the worst case choice. I will end up as best as

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.110
I can. So A is going to basically try to find the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.370
maximum minimum, and B is trying to find the minimum maximum.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.620
&gt;&gt; Hmm

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.170
&gt;&gt; In fact that strategy has a name, or that way of

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.280
thinking about it has a name. What do you think it's called?

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.360
&gt;&gt; The minimum, maximum.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.190
&gt;&gt; Yes, or Mini max.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.560
&gt;&gt; Which is movie production company, I think.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.790
&gt;&gt; No, that was Miramax. Do you recall

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.330
that where you have seen Mini max before

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.100
Michael? In some other class that you once

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.920
taught or once took years and years ago?

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.480
&gt;&gt; Mmm. No.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.290
&gt;&gt; Mini max was exactly the algorythm that

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.470
we use for game search. And intro to AI.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.960
&gt;&gt; Oh, which was a game tree, which is just what we

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.880
started with in this case. Even though we turned it into a matrix.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.780
&gt;&gt; Exactly. So

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.180
in the end, we, you know, this matrix induces a game tree, if you want to

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.810
think about it that way. Or, game tree

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.500
induces a matrix, if you want to think about

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.990
it that way. And the strategy then, in sort of basic AI search, and the strategy

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.090
in game theory is Minimax when you're in

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.440
a two player zero sum game of perfect information.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.570
&gt;&gt; So is there a way to do alpha beta pruning on this?

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.800
&gt;&gt; All alpha beta pruning does is gives you a more efficient

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.700
way of finding the answer.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.180
&gt;&gt; I see but it's the same answer no matter how you set it up.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.840
&gt;&gt; Right. Cool.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.070
&gt;&gt; That's right. Okay, so this is pretty cool.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.410
So, we have set up a kind of game

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.810
where we have multiple agents, you know, or at

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.860
least two agents in this case, who have different

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.950
strategies. And we actually sort of know, [SOUND], you

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.360
know, sort of, in a world where it's a

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.480
zero sum game, and you know the other person

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.190
is trying to minimize what you get, maximize what

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.280
they get. That the mini-max strategy would actually

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.900
give you sort of an answer, in this

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.650
case, by the way. We say that the value of this game for a is three.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.070
If a does the rational thing, and b does the rational thing, that is trying to

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.600
maximize their own value, you will end up

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.790
in this situation. That's kind of cool, don't you think?

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.950
&gt;&gt; Very cool. I feel like there should be a theorem.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.320
&gt;&gt; There is in fact a theorem. I'm going to write it down.
