00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.290
Welcome to the strength test.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.210
Obviously, the ice block chop.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm going to take
your completed knives

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.710
and I'm going to
smash them quite

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.000
vigorously and enthusiastically
into these big chunks of ice 10

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.710
times.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.000
And I want to see what the ice
is going to do to your knives.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.290
Ethan, you're up first.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.170
You ready?

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.040
Let's make snow-cones.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.920
My main worry is
that the ice will

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.210
split open any seams on my
blade that didn't weld properly.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.080
[rock music]

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.920
Good god, man.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.750
[dramatic music]

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.420
Well, Ethan, your edge held up
pretty well for the most part.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.250
That heavy convex helped you.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.790
The big issue I have is the
handle, the way it tapers down.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.960
When I was striking,
I started out here

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.580
and I ended up with a
knife like this in my hand.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.750
If it wasn't for the
little hook back here,

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.380
it would have gone
out of my hand.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.620
Overall, your knife
survived the ice.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.880
Good job.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.710
Ron, how are you feeling?

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.580
Little nervous.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.750
It's all right,
I'm not nervous.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.540
It will be OK.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.290
[nervous laughter]

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.210
RON: Watching Ethan's blade
perform, I'm feeling good.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.040
We both used a
chain and sprocket

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.540
on each side of
the blade, so I'm

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.290
ready to see mine perform too.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.120
[rock music]

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.420
Oh, Ron, there's
definitely a big issue here.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.330
Material sheared right away
from the sprocket steel here.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.580
When you first took that
chain, you put it in the forge

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.580
and heated it up cherry red and
then set it aside, not built

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.960
up forge scale on that chain.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.460
I would like to have
seen you go ahead

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.830
and actually start
trying to clean

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.330
that up right off the
bat, because there's

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.620
that forge scale.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.750
There's nothing
holding this together.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.080
Ron, your blade has
suffered a catastrophic blade

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.790
failure in our strength test.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.670
However, it doesn't mean
you're out of this competition.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.040
Liam, your blade still has to
go through the strength test,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.830
and it would seem that
both of your fates

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.830
ride on whether or not
Liam's blade can hold up.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.670
[dramatic music]

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.380
Even with Ron's
catastrophic failure,

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.880
they still have
to test my blade.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.710
I used the wrong
metal for my edge.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.330
I know it's going to pick up
some damage against the ice,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.330
I just don't know how much.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.330
I could still be going home.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.170
[rock music]

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.830
Well, Liam survived.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.040
You've got a couple of
small rolls on here,

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.920
but overall the edge
held up very well.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.210
The only thing is the handle--

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.920
it's on the narrow side.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.330
You can see it actually kind of
got into your tang a bit there.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.380
And the texturing is a
nice touch and a good idea,

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.540
but smoothing it out
would have helped a lot.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.170
Liam, your blade held
up, congratulations.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.170
Ron, unfortunately that
means that your blade

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.880
did not make the cut.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.670
I have to ask you to
please leave the forge.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.580
Thank you.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.420
RON: Being here
meant a lot to me.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.920
I didn't make it all the
way, but when I get home

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.380
I'm going to get all my kids,
give them all a big hug,

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.380
and practice with
some more chain.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.920
This time I won't heat
the chain as long.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.920
