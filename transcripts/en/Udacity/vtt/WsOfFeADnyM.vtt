00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.350
Your next task is to update the sample
app to let users see the daily special.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:05.900
But of course,

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.070
you'll need daily specials to suit
all kinds of food preferences.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.380
Vegetarian, vegan, fish only and more.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.410
And you want diners of all nationalities
to be able to read the daily special

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.180
in their own language.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.310
How do you code your app to offer
the right daily special and

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.810
the right language for each person?

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.250
According to their food preferences.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.570
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.790
You want me to code like that?

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:35.300
&gt;&gt; No, you don't have to write
conditional code for every possibility.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.360
You can't, anyway because who knows
what your chef is going to dream up for

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.280
the daily special next month.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.120
Let alone tomorrow.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.930
The good news is that using TagManager
you only have to write the code once,

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.700
in a straightforward way and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.400
then you can use TagManager
to set the special each day.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.818
You can update the value in
the dashboard whenever your chef invents

00:00:56.818 --> 00:01:00.960
a new, creative concoction to
offer to unsuspecting diners.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.620
You won't need to update your app code
just because the chef switches to

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.200
a gingerbread garnish
instead of a honeycomb sauce.
