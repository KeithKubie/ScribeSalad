TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.053
and this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:04.053 --> 00:00:05.760
from Google in the last week.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.610
To improve security,
insecure TLS version fallback

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.970
has been removed from
HttpsURLConnection

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.340
in Android O. While
most apps will not

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.884
be affected by this change,
the easiest way to be sure

00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:19.300
is to build and test your app
with the Android O Developer

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.980
Preview.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.250
Details and links are on the
post linked in the description

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.990
below.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.060
TensorFlow Sequence-to-Sequence
is now available.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.790
It's an open source
sequence-to-sequence framework

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.250
in TensorFlow that makes
it easy to experiment

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.010
with sequence-to-sequence
models and achieve

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.810
state of the art results.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.470
Links to the papers and the
GitHub are on the posts.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.300
We've partnered with
Udacity to offer

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.354
a free two-day
interactive course that

00:00:44.354 --> 00:00:46.770
will help you learn how to use
Firebased Analytics to grow

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.650
your user base on
iOS and Android.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.290
You'll see how to
set goals, how to log

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.480
users' interactions
with an app, and even

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.750
analyze real data from an app
that's live in the Google Play

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.390
Store and in the App Store.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.060
If you'd like a way to automate
creating Google Cloud Platform

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.700
projects, either because
you have a lot of them,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.980
or maybe you want to
standardize project

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.470
creation for your company,
well, you're in luck.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.040
Google Cloud Deployment
Manager is the native GCP tool

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.020
that you can use to create
and manage GCP resources,

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.430
including Compute Engine,
Container Engine, Cloud SQL,

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.090
BigQuery, Cloud Storage, and now
to create and manage projects

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.990
as well.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.270

I'm Timothy Jordan, and
I'll see you next week.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.400
Thanks for watching this
week's episode of the Dev Show.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.608
If you'd like to catch some
of our previous episodes,

00:01:37.608 --> 00:01:40.110
