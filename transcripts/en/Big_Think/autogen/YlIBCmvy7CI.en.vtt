00:28:06.899 --> 00:28:08.810
an idiot on that score of the probe and
it's called there is a way to unlock

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:08.820
it's called there is a way to unlock
 

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.310
it's called there is a way to unlock
human potential but it's not

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320
human potential but it's not
 

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:17.269
human potential but it's not
standardized testing

00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279
 

00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:20.759
the idea of what we should be testing is

00:28:20.759 --> 00:28:20.769
the idea of what we should be testing is
 

00:28:20.769 --> 00:28:23.430
the idea of what we should be testing is
a very hotly debated because there's a

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440
a very hotly debated because there's a
 

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.080
a very hotly debated because there's a
certain objectivity that we think we

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:25.090
certain objectivity that we think we
 

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:27.659
certain objectivity that we think we
have once way standardized things and we

00:28:27.659 --> 00:28:27.669
have once way standardized things and we
 

00:28:27.669 --> 00:28:28.950
have once way standardized things and we
give it the same test to everyone and

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960
give it the same test to everyone and
 

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.779
give it the same test to everyone and
there is some truth to that that the

00:28:30.779 --> 00:28:30.789
there is some truth to that that the
 

00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:33.960
there is some truth to that that the
more you standardize a test the more you

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:33.970
more you standardize a test the more you
 

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:36.479
more you standardize a test the more you
kind of give everyone the opportunity to

00:28:36.479 --> 00:28:36.489
kind of give everyone the opportunity to
 

00:28:36.489 --> 00:28:38.999
kind of give everyone the opportunity to
perform on that test there so there is

00:28:38.999 --> 00:28:39.009
perform on that test there so there is
 

00:28:39.009 --> 00:28:40.710
perform on that test there so there is
some argument to be made towards

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:40.720
some argument to be made towards
 

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.599
some argument to be made towards
standardization but we don't have

00:28:42.599 --> 00:28:42.609
standardization but we don't have
 

00:28:42.609 --> 00:28:43.979
standardization but we don't have
standardized minds I mean no one has a

00:28:43.979 --> 00:28:43.989
standardized minds I mean no one has a
 

00:28:43.989 --> 00:28:45.389

again debunking this idea that somehow

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:14.850
again debunking this idea that somehow

again debunking this idea that somehow
male desire male libido is far stronger

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:17.850
male desire male libido is far stronger

male desire male libido is far stronger
innately than female libido but what

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:20.370
innately than female libido but what
 

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:22.820
innately than female libido but what
happens interestingly is that male

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:22.830

think two things are worth saying first
again the very least this calls into

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:39.960
again the very least this calls into
 

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:43.130
again the very least this calls into
question this idea that somehow women

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:43.140
