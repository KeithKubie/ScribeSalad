welcome to the second lecture in this
 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.750
welcome to the second lecture in this
series on how brains work from frontiers

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:10.760
series on how brains work from frontiers
 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.690
series on how brains work from frontiers
of science online in the first lecture

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700
of science online in the first lecture
 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.450
of science online in the first lecture
we talked about the human brain and how

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460
we talked about the human brain and how
 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.790
we talked about the human brain and how
it worked and we pointed out that brain

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800
it worked and we pointed out that brain
 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.130
it worked and we pointed out that brain
is are made up of nerve cells or neurons

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140
is are made up of nerve cells or neurons
 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.020
is are made up of nerve cells or neurons
that are connected together as

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.030
that are connected together as
 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.960
that are connected together as
functional units neural networks and

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970
functional units neural networks and
 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.550
functional units neural networks and
today we're going to be talking about

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560
today we're going to be talking about
 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.850
today we're going to be talking about
neural networks for vocal communication

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860
neural networks for vocal communication
 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.679
neural networks for vocal communication
we also talked about two principles of

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689
we also talked about two principles of
 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.380
we also talked about two principles of
brain function one is what I call the

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390
brain function one is what I call the
 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.989
brain function one is what I call the
real estate principle location location

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:37.999
real estate principle location location
 

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:40.959
real estate principle location location
and location and that's the idea that

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969
and location and that's the idea that
 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.000
and location and that's the idea that
different tasks that the brain is

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010
different tasks that the brain is
 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.500
different tasks that the brain is
engaged in are handled in different

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510
engaged in are handled in different
 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.930
engaged in are handled in different
brain regions and that by learning about

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940
brain regions and that by learning about
 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.669
brain regions and that by learning about
different regions of the brain we can

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:48.679
different regions of the brain we can
 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:51.130
different regions of the brain we can
have some idea of how the very complex

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140
have some idea of how the very complex
 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.369
have some idea of how the very complex
behaviors that the brain produces relate

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379
behaviors that the brain produces relate
 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.020
behaviors that the brain produces relate
to the neural structures that are

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030
to the neural structures that are
 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.299
to the neural structures that are
responsible we also talked about the

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309
responsible we also talked about the
 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.910
responsible we also talked about the
magnification principle the idea that if

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920
magnification principle the idea that if
 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.189
magnification principle the idea that if
a particular behavior or a particular

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199
a particular behavior or a particular
 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.259
a particular behavior or a particular
function is very important to an animal

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269
function is very important to an animal
 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.940
function is very important to an animal
that that part of the brain will be

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950
that that part of the brain will be
 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.100
that that part of the brain will be
larger than it will and in other species

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110
larger than it will and in other species
 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.350
larger than it will and in other species
in which that function is not so

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360
in which that function is not so
 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.749
in which that function is not so
important so in US for example our

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759
important so in US for example our
 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.510
important so in US for example our
visual areas are huge as they are in all

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520
visual areas are huge as they are in all
 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.090
visual areas are huge as they are in all
primates and they're a lot smaller in a

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100
primates and they're a lot smaller in a
 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.480
primates and they're a lot smaller in a
bat or maps and today we're going to

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490
bat or maps and today we're going to
 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.160
bat or maps and today we're going to
talk about areas that are involved in

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170
talk about areas that are involved in
 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.050
talk about areas that are involved in
vocal communication which are also very

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060
vocal communication which are also very
 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.410
vocal communication which are also very
large in US and also over-represented in

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420
large in US and also over-represented in
 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.510
large in US and also over-represented in
species for which this is an important

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520
species for which this is an important
 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.319
species for which this is an important
behavior now the underlying assumption

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329
behavior now the underlying assumption
 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.080
behavior now the underlying assumption
in all of these studies on how the brain

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090
in all of these studies on how the brain
 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.120
in all of these studies on how the brain
works is the idea that you are your

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130
works is the idea that you are your
 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.639
works is the idea that you are your
brain but Francis Crick called the

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649
brain but Francis Crick called the
 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.219
brain but Francis Crick called the
astonishing hypothesis that you all of

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229
astonishing hypothesis that you all of
 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.440
astonishing hypothesis that you all of
your emotions all of the very complex

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450
your emotions all of the very complex
 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.870
your emotions all of the very complex
aspects that make you what you are are

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880
aspects that make you what you are are
 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.880
aspects that make you what you are are
actually represented in the nervous

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890
actually represented in the nervous
 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.859
actually represented in the nervous
system and I pointed out in the last

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869
system and I pointed out in the last
 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.289
system and I pointed out in the last
lecture that this idea is actually

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299
lecture that this idea is actually
 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.800
lecture that this idea is actually
two-way street so the brain both creates

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810
two-way street so the brain both creates
 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.169
two-way street so the brain both creates
behaviors and is modified by the

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179
behaviors and is modified by the
 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.779
behaviors and is modified by the
consequences of those behaviors and one

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789
consequences of those behaviors and one
 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.609
consequences of those behaviors and one
of the things that happens is the brain

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619
of the things that happens is the brain
 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.440
of the things that happens is the brain
develops because the brain doesn't know

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450
develops because the brain doesn't know
 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.270
develops because the brain doesn't know
ahead of time what kind of organism

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280
ahead of time what kind of organism
 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.100
ahead of time what kind of organism
that's going to end up in is that

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110
that's going to end up in is that
 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.990
that's going to end up in is that
experience modifies the brain and

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000
experience modifies the brain and
 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.420
experience modifies the brain and
personalizes it so your brain is

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430
personalizes it so your brain is
 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.120
personalizes it so your brain is
different from the brain of everyone

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130
different from the brain of everyone
 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.400
different from the brain of everyone
on the planet as a result of your

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410
on the planet as a result of your
 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.830
on the planet as a result of your
experience both your learning experience

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840
experience both your learning experience
 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.930
experience both your learning experience
and your cultural experience but also

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940
and your cultural experience but also
 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.270
and your cultural experience but also
the experience that happens inside of

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280
the experience that happens inside of
 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.340
the experience that happens inside of
the body the hormones that the brain is

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350
the body the hormones that the brain is
 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.710
the body the hormones that the brain is
exposed to so today we're going to talk

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720
exposed to so today we're going to talk
 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.270
exposed to so today we're going to talk
about that idea and we're going to talk

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280
about that idea and we're going to talk
 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.550
about that idea and we're going to talk
about a significant aspect of

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560
about a significant aspect of
 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.710
about a significant aspect of
personalization how brains become male

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720
personalization how brains become male
 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.560
personalization how brains become male
and female we're going to talk about how

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570
and female we're going to talk about how
 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.240
and female we're going to talk about how
you would discover exactly how that

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250
you would discover exactly how that
 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.520
you would discover exactly how that
worked how you take that system apart

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530
worked how you take that system apart
 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.370
worked how you take that system apart
and the idea of model organism systems

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380
and the idea of model organism systems
 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.380
and the idea of model organism systems
in which a question of general interests

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390
in which a question of general interests
 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.870
in which a question of general interests
can be studied rather easily we're going

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880
can be studied rather easily we're going
 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.310
can be studied rather easily we're going
to talk about a particular model

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320
to talk about a particular model
 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.920
to talk about a particular model
organism a frog that lives in africa

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930
organism a frog that lives in africa
 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.960
organism a frog that lives in africa
that sings underwater and sings its

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970
that sings underwater and sings its
 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.880
that sings underwater and sings its
songs in the dark and we're going to

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890
songs in the dark and we're going to
 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.650
songs in the dark and we're going to
talk about how the male and female

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660
talk about how the male and female
 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.290
talk about how the male and female
versions of the brain that produces

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300
versions of the brain that produces
 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.690
versions of the brain that produces
those different songs is generated and

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700
those different songs is generated and
 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.520
those different songs is generated and
then finally we're going to talk about

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530
then finally we're going to talk about
 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.210
then finally we're going to talk about
the overarching issue of whether biology

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220
the overarching issue of whether biology
 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.870
the overarching issue of whether biology
and destiny are inextricably intertwined

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880
and destiny are inextricably intertwined
 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.460
and destiny are inextricably intertwined
and how we might even look at that in an

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470
and how we might even look at that in an
 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:26.270
and how we might even look at that in an
experimental way

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280
 
 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.620
 
you

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630
 
 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.230
 
so let's start out with the idea of

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240
so let's start out with the idea of
 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.170
so let's start out with the idea of
personalizing your brain so brains are

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180
personalizing your brain so brains are
 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.250
personalizing your brain so brains are
very complicated they're very

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260
very complicated they're very
 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.100
very complicated they're very
complicated in both sexes and the brain

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110
complicated in both sexes and the brain
 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.410
complicated in both sexes and the brain
of the newborn doesn't actually know

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420
of the newborn doesn't actually know
 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.240
of the newborn doesn't actually know
that much about the body in which it

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250
that much about the body in which it
 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.770
that much about the body in which it
resides and there's a consequence of

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780
resides and there's a consequence of
 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.380
resides and there's a consequence of
experiences that that brain has both in

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390
experiences that that brain has both in
 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.750
experiences that that brain has both in
utero and shortly after birth and also

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760
utero and shortly after birth and also
 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.910
utero and shortly after birth and also
at puberty the brains of males and

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920
at puberty the brains of males and
 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.490
at puberty the brains of males and
females become rather different and one

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500
females become rather different and one
 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.130
females become rather different and one
of the main ideas in this field is the

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140
of the main ideas in this field is the
 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.560
of the main ideas in this field is the
idea that the experience that's

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570
idea that the experience that's
 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.900
idea that the experience that's
responsible initially from making the

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910
responsible initially from making the
 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.820
responsible initially from making the
brains of males and females different

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830
brains of males and females different
 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.520
brains of males and females different
are hormones hormones that are secreted

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530
are hormones hormones that are secreted
 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.960
are hormones hormones that are secreted
by the male and female reproductive

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970
by the male and female reproductive
 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.020
by the male and female reproductive
organs so here's a diagram of one of

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030
organs so here's a diagram of one of
 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.080
organs so here's a diagram of one of
those hormones shown up here and these

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090
those hormones shown up here and these
 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.729
those hormones shown up here and these
are steroid hormones and we're going to

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739
are steroid hormones and we're going to
 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.640
are steroid hormones and we're going to
talk about how steroid hormones sculpt

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650
talk about how steroid hormones sculpt
 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.100
talk about how steroid hormones sculpt
the neural networks that are responsible

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110
the neural networks that are responsible
 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.270
the neural networks that are responsible
for vocal behavior so this is a talk

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280
for vocal behavior so this is a talk
 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.420
for vocal behavior so this is a talk
about the vocal communication of sexual

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430
about the vocal communication of sexual
 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.160
about the vocal communication of sexual
information of information on

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170
information of information on
 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.930
information of information on
reproductive status on whether

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940
reproductive status on whether
 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.180
reproductive status on whether
individuals are interested in mating and

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190
individuals are interested in mating and
 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.650
individuals are interested in mating and
we're going to talk about it in a

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660
we're going to talk about it in a
 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.080
we're going to talk about it in a
particular model system and this is the

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090
particular model system and this is the
 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:51.330
particular model system and this is the
South African clawed frog Xenopus laevis

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340
 
 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.010
 
now let's talk for a moment about the

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020
now let's talk for a moment about the
 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.649
now let's talk for a moment about the
Frog because all model organisms are

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:56.659
Frog because all model organisms are
 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:58.300
Frog because all model organisms are
also organisms with their own

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310
also organisms with their own
 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.219
also organisms with their own
evolutionary history their own

cloud blank Bank here and they occupy

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240
cloud blank Bank here and they occupy
 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.850
cloud blank Bank here and they occupy
this entire region there are lots of

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860
this entire region there are lots of
 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.980
this entire region there are lots of
different species of them and as you'll

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990
different species of them and as you'll
 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.080
different species of them and as you'll
see in a little while they used to have

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090
see in a little while they used to have
 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.809
see in a little while they used to have
a much larger distribution in Africa but

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:19.819
a much larger distribution in Africa but
 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.670
a much larger distribution in Africa but
wherever you find standing bodies of

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680
wherever you find standing bodies of
 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.439
wherever you find standing bodies of
water in Africa you have a good chance

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:23.449
water in Africa you have a good chance
 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.290
water in Africa you have a good chance
of finding these frogs so this frog the

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300
of finding these frogs so this frog the
 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.570
of finding these frogs so this frog the
South African clawed frog you can see

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580
South African clawed frog you can see
 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.459
South African clawed frog you can see
the little claws on the end of its toes

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:30.469
the little claws on the end of its toes
 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:33.999
the little claws on the end of its toes
which it uses to reduce food to

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:34.009
which it uses to reduce food to
 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:37.119
which it uses to reduce food to
manageable proportions has both males

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:37.129
manageable proportions has both males
 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:38.800
manageable proportions has both males
and females as you would expect and you

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810
and females as you would expect and you
 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.540
and females as you would expect and you
can see here that the females are a lot

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550
can see here that the females are a lot
 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.519
can see here that the females are a lot
larger than the males a feature that

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:42.529
larger than the males a feature that
 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:44.350
larger than the males a feature that
I've always enjoyed in the species and

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360
I've always enjoyed in the species and
 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.540
I've always enjoyed in the species and
that's true in a lot of animals where a

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550
that's true in a lot of animals where a
 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.249
that's true in a lot of animals where a
large part of the body mass of the

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:48.259
large part of the body mass of the
 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:51.939
large part of the body mass of the
female is made up of eggs so the word

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:51.949
female is made up of eggs so the word
 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.820
female is made up of eggs so the word
Xenopus means strange foot and the word

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830
Xenopus means strange foot and the word
 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.790
Xenopus means strange foot and the word
Lavis means slippery and these animals

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800
Lavis means slippery and these animals
 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.649
Lavis means slippery and these animals
are so slippery that the males have

00:05:59.649 --> 00:05:59.659
are so slippery that the males have
 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:01.929
are so slippery that the males have
developed a special mechanism that helps

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:01.939
developed a special mechanism that helps
 

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:04.209
developed a special mechanism that helps
them hold on to the females so here's a

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:04.219
them hold on to the females so here's a
 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:06.159
them hold on to the females so here's a
view of the underside of the Frog it's

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169
view of the underside of the Frog it's
 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:09.129
view of the underside of the Frog it's
under water and you can see here gloving

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139
under water and you can see here gloving
 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:11.820
under water and you can see here gloving

electron micrograph at what those
nuptial pads are made up of you see that

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460
nuptial pads are made up of you see that
 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.889
nuptial pads are made up of you see that
they consist of these little epidermal

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:26.899
they consist of these little epidermal
 

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:29.920
they consist of these little epidermal
spines it's a little bit like Teflon so

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.820
 
now for our purposes one of the good

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830
now for our purposes one of the good
 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.090
now for our purposes one of the good
things about the animal is that it has

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.100
things about the animal is that it has
 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.550
things about the animal is that it has
distinctive male and female behaviors so

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560
distinctive male and female behaviors so
 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.370
distinctive male and female behaviors so
when a male is underwater at night he

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380
when a male is underwater at night he
 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.890
when a male is underwater at night he
sings and he sings very frequently

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:00.900
sings and he sings very frequently
 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.050
sings and he sings very frequently
sometimes for half-hour an hour at a

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:15.260
time producing what we call the male
advertisement call males produce this

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.270
advertisement call males produce this
 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.440
advertisement call males produce this
call by themselves with other males and

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:18.450
call by themselves with other males and
 

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.590
call by themselves with other males and
the females are around and it's

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:20.600
the females are around and it's
 

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.210
the females are around and it's
advertising their presence to members of

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:23.220
advertising their presence to members of
 

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.250
advertising their presence to members of
their own species male or female

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:25.260
their own species male or female
 

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.650
their own species male or female
now females in this species come in two

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:27.660
now females in this species come in two
 

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.170
now females in this species come in two
flavors most of the time they are not

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180
flavors most of the time they are not
 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.080
flavors most of the time they are not
ready to mate and if a male class the

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:33.090
ready to mate and if a male class the
 

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.240
ready to mate and if a male class the
female that's not ready to mate one of

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:35.250
female that's not ready to mate one of
 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.860
female that's not ready to mate one of
the ways in which she communicates this

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:36.870
the ways in which she communicates this
 

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.410
the ways in which she communicates this
is by using a specific behavior called

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:39.420
is by using a specific behavior called
 

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:49.850
is by using a specific behavior called
ticking which sounds like a clock so

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:49.860
ticking which sounds like a clock so
 

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.700
ticking which sounds like a clock so
ticking is a very effective behavior for

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:52.710
ticking is a very effective behavior for
 

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.110
ticking is a very effective behavior for
males they let her go

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.120

you so one of the nice features of this

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240
you so one of the nice features of this
 

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.030
you so one of the nice features of this
system just to begin with is that the

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:02.040
system just to begin with is that the
 

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.130
system just to begin with is that the
vocal behaviors of the sexes are very

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:04.140

have is species of these frogs

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:21.640
have is species of these frogs

and I'll show you the way it works in a
moment but one of the first things that

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:52.350
moment but one of the first things that
 

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:54.230
moment but one of the first things that
we saw when we started working on the

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240
we saw when we started working on the
 

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.509
we saw when we started working on the
animal was that not only were the

00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:56.519
animal was that not only were the
 

00:15:56.519 --> 00:15:59.030
animal was that not only were the
behaviors the vocal behaviors of males

00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040
behaviors the vocal behaviors of males
 

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.790
behaviors the vocal behaviors of males
and females different but also the vocal

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:01.800
and females different but also the vocal
 

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.920
and females different but also the vocal
organ itself was very different in the

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:03.930
organ itself was very different in the
 

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:06.500
organ itself was very different in the
sexes so the larynx is sexually

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:06.510
sexes so the larynx is sexually
 

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.540
sexes so the larynx is sexually
dimorphic as what we'd say different in

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:08.550
dimorphic as what we'd say different in
 

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.970
dimorphic as what we'd say different in
shape between males and females and you

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:10.980
shape between males and females and you
 

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.400
shape between males and females and you
can see that clearly here so how are

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:13.410
can see that clearly here so how are
 

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:15.410
can see that clearly here so how are
these little individual clicks produced

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:15.420
these little individual clicks produced
 

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.780
these little individual clicks produced
it's actually pretty simple the muscles

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:17.790
it's actually pretty simple the muscles
 

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:20.840
it's actually pretty simple the muscles
contract tendons pull on the disks and

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:20.850
contract tendons pull on the disks and
 

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:23.240
contract tendons pull on the disks and
every time the disks move what happens

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:23.250
every time the disks move what happens
 

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:26.300
every time the disks move what happens
is you get a single click sound so here

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:26.310
is you get a single click sound so here
 

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:28.009
is you get a single click sound so here
the disks have moved and produced a

00:16:28.009 --> 00:16:28.019
the disks have moved and produced a
 

00:16:28.019 --> 00:16:30.829
the disks have moved and produced a
single click sound when they pop apart

00:16:30.829 --> 00:16:30.839
single click sound when they pop apart
 

00:16:30.839 --> 00:16:33.319
single click sound when they pop apart
so in a male you can have click sounds

00:16:33.319 --> 00:16:33.329
so in a male you can have click sounds
 

00:16:33.329 --> 00:16:35.569
so in a male you can have click sounds
as fast as 70 clicks a second and

00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:35.579
as fast as 70 clicks a second and
 

00:16:35.579 --> 00:16:37.220
as fast as 70 clicks a second and
they're female it's an order of

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:37.230
they're female it's an order of
 

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.519
they're female it's an order of
magnitude lower only about 7 clicks a

00:16:40.519 --> 00:16:40.529
magnitude lower only about 7 clicks a
 

00:16:40.529 --> 00:16:44.300
magnitude lower only about 7 clicks a
second so this difference in the speed

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:44.310
second so this difference in the speed
 

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:46.389
second so this difference in the speed
of contraction of the muscles is

00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399
of contraction of the muscles is
 

00:16:46.399 --> 00:16:49.280
of contraction of the muscles is
actually due to the kinds of muscle

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:49.290
actually due to the kinds of muscle
 

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:52.280
actually due to the kinds of muscle
fibers that males and females have males

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:52.290
fibers that males and females have males
 

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:54.650
fibers that males and females have males
have mostly fast muscle fibers and

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:54.660
have mostly fast muscle fibers and
 

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.079
have mostly fast muscle fibers and
females have mostly slow muscle fibers

00:16:57.079 --> 00:16:57.089
females have mostly slow muscle fibers
 

00:16:57.089 --> 00:17:00.259
females have mostly slow muscle fibers
so as a model organism we can say first

00:17:00.259 --> 00:17:00.269
so as a model organism we can say first
 

00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:02.420
so as a model organism we can say first
they have sex specific behaviors and

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:02.430
they have sex specific behaviors and
 

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.909
they have sex specific behaviors and
second the male and female vocal organs

00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:04.919
second the male and female vocal organs
 

00:17:04.919 --> 00:17:06.670
second the male and female vocal organs
are also different in the sec

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:06.680
are also different in the sec
 

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.370
are also different in the sec
so these are good places to start to try

00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:09.380
so these are good places to start to try
 

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.320
so these are good places to start to try
to figure out how the vocal system

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:11.330
to figure out how the vocal system
 

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:17.559
to figure out how the vocal system
becomes sexually differentiated

00:17:17.559 --> 00:17:17.569
 
 

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:21.159
 
so what about the brain how does the

00:17:21.159 --> 00:17:21.169
so what about the brain how does the
 

00:17:21.169 --> 00:17:23.559
so what about the brain how does the
brain work and what we did was we

00:17:23.559 --> 00:17:23.569
brain work and what we did was we
 

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:25.840
brain work and what we did was we
actually took the model organism and

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:25.850
actually took the model organism and
 

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:27.789
actually took the model organism and
made another model system within the

00:17:27.789 --> 00:17:27.799
made another model system within the
 

00:17:27.799 --> 00:17:30.340
made another model system within the
model organism here's the brain of the

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:30.350
model organism here's the brain of the
 

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.379
model organism here's the brain of the
frog it's sitting in its head and it

00:17:32.379 --> 00:17:32.389
frog it's sitting in its head and it
 

00:17:32.389 --> 00:17:35.049
frog it's sitting in its head and it
connects up to its vocal organ and the

00:17:35.049 --> 00:17:35.059
connects up to its vocal organ and the
 

00:17:35.059 --> 00:17:36.879
connects up to its vocal organ and the
cells that go from the brain to the

00:17:36.879 --> 00:17:36.889
cells that go from the brain to the
 

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:38.889
cells that go from the brain to the
vocal organ are called motor neurons

00:17:38.889 --> 00:17:38.899
vocal organ are called motor neurons
 

00:17:38.899 --> 00:17:41.049
vocal organ are called motor neurons
they're nerve cells that sit in the

00:17:41.049 --> 00:17:41.059
they're nerve cells that sit in the
 

00:17:41.059 --> 00:17:43.450
they're nerve cells that sit in the
brain and that send a process all the

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:43.460
brain and that send a process all the
 

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.639
brain and that send a process all the
way down here to the muscle fibers here

00:17:45.639 --> 00:17:45.649
way down here to the muscle fibers here
 

00:17:45.649 --> 00:17:48.129
way down here to the muscle fibers here
their diagram the motor neuron the axon

and what these guys do is when they're

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960
and what these guys do is when they're
 

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.799
and what these guys do is when they're
electrically active there's chemical

00:17:53.799 --> 00:17:53.809
electrically active there's chemical
 

00:17:53.809 --> 00:17:56.499
electrically active there's chemical
information passed from the nerve cell

00:17:56.499 --> 00:17:56.509
information passed from the nerve cell
 

00:17:56.509 --> 00:17:58.989
information passed from the nerve cell
to the muscle fiber the muscle fiber

00:17:58.989 --> 00:17:58.999
to the muscle fiber the muscle fiber
 

00:17:58.999 --> 00:18:01.570
to the muscle fiber the muscle fiber
then becomes electrically active and it

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:01.580
then becomes electrically active and it
 

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:04.089
then becomes electrically active and it
contracts and this connection between

00:18:04.089 --> 00:18:04.099
contracts and this connection between
 

00:18:04.099 --> 00:18:07.029
contracts and this connection between
the motor nerve cell and the muscle

00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039
the motor nerve cell and the muscle
 

00:18:07.039 --> 00:18:09.190
the motor nerve cell and the muscle
fiber which is shown down here that

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.200
fiber which is shown down here that
 

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.049
fiber which is shown down here that
connection is called the synapse is

00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:11.059
connection is called the synapse is
 

00:18:11.059 --> 00:18:13.479
connection is called the synapse is
called the neuromuscular synapse and

00:18:13.479 --> 00:18:13.489
called the neuromuscular synapse and
 

00:18:13.489 --> 00:18:14.979
called the neuromuscular synapse and
that actually turns out to be a very

00:18:14.979 --> 00:18:14.989
that actually turns out to be a very
 

00:18:14.989 --> 00:18:17.259
that actually turns out to be a very
good model for the same kinds of

00:18:17.259 --> 00:18:17.269
good model for the same kinds of
 

00:18:17.269 --> 00:18:19.180
good model for the same kinds of
connections that you see in the central

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:19.190
connections that you see in the central
 

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:23.469
connections that you see in the central
nervous system so in order to figure out

00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:23.479
nervous system so in order to figure out
 

00:18:23.479 --> 00:18:25.749
nervous system so in order to figure out
where these cells are in the brain that

00:18:25.749 --> 00:18:25.759
where these cells are in the brain that
 

00:18:25.759 --> 00:18:28.779
where these cells are in the brain that
are responsible for producing the sounds

00:18:28.779 --> 00:18:28.789
are responsible for producing the sounds
 

00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:32.080
are responsible for producing the sounds
what we did was to put small drop of dye

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:32.090
what we did was to put small drop of dye
 

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:35.229
what we did was to put small drop of dye
on the axons and they were then this dye

00:18:35.229 --> 00:18:35.239
on the axons and they were then this dye
 

00:18:35.239 --> 00:18:37.539
on the axons and they were then this dye
was then carried back by diffusion into

00:18:37.539 --> 00:18:37.549
was then carried back by diffusion into
 

00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:40.509
was then carried back by diffusion into
the brain and showed us the neurons that

00:18:40.509 --> 00:18:40.519
the brain and showed us the neurons that
 

00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:42.729
the brain and showed us the neurons that
are responsible for producing the clicks

00:18:42.729 --> 00:18:42.739
are responsible for producing the clicks
 

00:18:42.739 --> 00:18:45.249
are responsible for producing the clicks
that produce songs so here you see a

00:18:45.249 --> 00:18:45.259
that produce songs so here you see a
 

00:18:45.259 --> 00:18:47.379
that produce songs so here you see a
side view of a frog brain this is front

00:18:47.379 --> 00:18:47.389
side view of a frog brain this is front
 

00:18:47.389 --> 00:18:49.060
side view of a frog brain this is front
and this is back this is up and this is

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:49.070
and this is back this is up and this is
 

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:53.019
and this is back this is up and this is
down here in this green area are located

00:18:53.019 --> 00:18:53.029
down here in this green area are located
 

00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:54.969
down here in this green area are located
the yellow cells that are labeled with

00:18:54.969 --> 00:18:54.979
the yellow cells that are labeled with
 

00:18:54.979 --> 00:18:57.310
the yellow cells that are labeled with
the dye and these are the motor neurons

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320
the dye and these are the motor neurons
 

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.639
the dye and these are the motor neurons
that go and connect to the muscle fiber

00:18:59.639 --> 00:18:59.649
that go and connect to the muscle fiber
 

00:18:59.649 --> 00:19:02.710
that go and connect to the muscle fiber
so we can now ask the question of

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720
so we can now ask the question of
 

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.049
so we can now ask the question of
whether in addition to the fact that

00:19:05.049 --> 00:19:05.059
whether in addition to the fact that
 

00:19:05.059 --> 00:19:07.659
whether in addition to the fact that
there's a sex difference in the in the

00:19:07.659 --> 00:19:07.669
there's a sex difference in the in the
 

00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:10.119
there's a sex difference in the in the
vocal organ itself which you can see

00:19:10.119 --> 00:19:10.129
vocal organ itself which you can see
 

00:19:10.129 --> 00:19:11.889
vocal organ itself which you can see
right here here's the male larynx and

00:19:11.889 --> 00:19:11.899
right here here's the male larynx and
 

00:19:11.899 --> 00:19:14.440
right here here's the male larynx and
the female larynx we can actually also

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:14.450
the female larynx we can actually also
 

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:16.749
the female larynx we can actually also
ask the question of whether the motor

00:19:16.749 --> 00:19:16.759
ask the question of whether the motor
 

00:19:16.759 --> 00:19:18.580
ask the question of whether the motor
neurons are different in males and in

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:18.590
neurons are different in males and in
 

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.889
neurons are different in males and in
females so here are male motor neurons

00:19:20.889 --> 00:19:20.899
females so here are male motor neurons
 

00:19:20.899 --> 00:19:22.839
females so here are male motor neurons
they hear a female motor neurons and I

00:19:22.839 --> 00:19:22.849
they hear a female motor neurons and I
 

00:19:22.849 --> 00:19:24.549
they hear a female motor neurons and I
think even looking at this picture you

00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559
think even looking at this picture you
 

00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:26.470
think even looking at this picture you
can tell that the male motor neurons are

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480
can tell that the male motor neurons are
 

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.049
can tell that the male motor neurons are
larger than most of the female motor

00:19:29.049 --> 00:19:29.059
larger than most of the female motor
 

00:19:29.059 --> 00:19:30.609
larger than most of the female motor
neurons and it looks like they're more

00:19:30.609 --> 00:19:30.619
neurons and it looks like they're more
 

00:19:30.619 --> 00:19:30.910
neurons and it looks like they're more
of

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:30.920
of
 

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.070
of
so it turns out they're about twice as

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:33.080
so it turns out they're about twice as
 

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:41.680
so it turns out they're about twice as
many motor neurons in males and females

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:41.690
 
 

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:44.980
 
so the model system has sex specific

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:44.990
so the model system has sex specific
 

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:48.550
so the model system has sex specific
behaviors male and female vocal organs

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:48.560
behaviors male and female vocal organs
 

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.220
behaviors male and female vocal organs
and male and female brains so what we

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:51.230
and male and female brains so what we
 

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:53.080
and male and female brains so what we
want to know next and the reason that

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:53.090
want to know next and the reason that
 

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:54.910
want to know next and the reason that
we're using this model system is how

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:54.920
we're using this model system is how
 

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.620
we're using this model system is how
does this work how does this come apart

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:56.630
does this work how does this come apart
 

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:58.870
does this work how does this come apart
and this is not an experiment that we

00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880
and this is not an experiment that we
 

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.180
and this is not an experiment that we
get to do in other organisms that we

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:01.190
get to do in other organisms that we
 

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:02.980
get to do in other organisms that we
dearly love we wouldn't do it in chimps

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:02.990
dearly love we wouldn't do it in chimps
 

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:05.170
dearly love we wouldn't do it in chimps
we wouldn't do it in us but on the

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:05.180
we wouldn't do it in us but on the
 

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.850
we wouldn't do it in us but on the
principle that the same principles are

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:06.860
principle that the same principles are
 

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.500
principle that the same principles are
going to apply we can do it on these

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:08.510
going to apply we can do it on these
 

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:11.380
going to apply we can do it on these
guys so these are frogs and like all

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:11.390
guys so these are frogs and like all
 

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:13.570
guys so these are frogs and like all
frogs they have two major stages of

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:13.580
frogs they have two major stages of
 

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.610
frogs they have two major stages of
developments that tadpoles for a while

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:15.620
developments that tadpoles for a while
 

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.470
developments that tadpoles for a while
and then they turn into small frogs and

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:17.480
and then they turn into small frogs and
 

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.450
and then they turn into small frogs and
the small frogs grow up to be bigger

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:19.460
the small frogs grow up to be bigger
 

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.090
the small frogs grow up to be bigger
frogs so these guys start out with

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:22.100
frogs so these guys start out with
 

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.730
frogs so these guys start out with
fertilization it takes them a couple

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:24.740
fertilization it takes them a couple
 

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.860
fertilization it takes them a couple
months to get to the stage of

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:26.870
months to get to the stage of
 

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.350
months to get to the stage of
metamorphosing from a tadpole into a

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360
metamorphosing from a tadpole into a
 

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.660
metamorphosing from a tadpole into a
small frog and then about a year for a

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:31.670
small frog and then about a year for a
 

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:33.610
small frog and then about a year for a
male to become sexually mature in about

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:33.620
male to become sexually mature in about
 

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.590
male to become sexually mature in about
two years for a female to become

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600
two years for a female to become
 

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.470
two years for a female to become
sexually mature so what we can do is we

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480
sexually mature so what we can do is we
 

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.750
sexually mature so what we can do is we
can go and say how do the sex

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:40.760
can go and say how do the sex
 

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:43.510
can go and say how do the sex
differences in the motor neurons and in

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520
differences in the motor neurons and in
 

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.670
differences in the motor neurons and in
the muscle fibers develop how do they

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:45.680
the muscle fibers develop how do they
 

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.370
the muscle fibers develop how do they
come about so what we discover is that

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:48.380
come about so what we discover is that
 

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.380
come about so what we discover is that
if we look at males and females they

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:50.390
if we look at males and females they
 

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:52.210
if we look at males and females they
both start out with the same number of

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:52.220
both start out with the same number of
 

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.760
both start out with the same number of
singing motor neurons and then they

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:54.770
singing motor neurons and then they
 

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:57.130
singing motor neurons and then they
start to die they die in both males and

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:57.140
start to die they die in both males and
 

00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:59.950
start to die they die in both males and
females but they die more rapidly and

00:20:59.950 --> 00:20:59.960
females but they die more rapidly and
 

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.840
females but they die more rapidly and
there's more death in males and in

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:01.850
there's more death in males and in
 

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:05.470
there's more death in males and in
females so at the end excuse me in

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:05.480
females so at the end excuse me in
 

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.780
females so at the end excuse me in
females and in males so that at the end

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:07.790
females and in males so that at the end
 

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:09.550
females and in males so that at the end
of development you end up with a

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:09.560
of development you end up with a
 

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.890
of development you end up with a
situation where males have about twice

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:11.900
situation where males have about twice
 

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.800
situation where males have about twice
the number of motor neurons as females

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:14.810
the number of motor neurons as females
 

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:17.860
the number of motor neurons as females
do so differences in the brain are due

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:17.870
do so differences in the brain are due
 

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:21.280
do so differences in the brain are due
to less death in males more death in

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:21.290
to less death in males more death in
 

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:24.190
to less death in males more death in
females how about the vocal organ how

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.200
females how about the vocal organ how
 

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.110
females how about the vocal organ how
does that work well if you go back

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:26.120
does that work well if you go back
 

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.600
does that work well if you go back
during tadpole life they start out with

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:28.610
during tadpole life they start out with
 

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:30.430
during tadpole life they start out with
the same number of muscle fibers and

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:30.440
the same number of muscle fibers and
 

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:33.160
the same number of muscle fibers and
then what happens is males start to add

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:33.170
then what happens is males start to add
 

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:36.790
then what happens is males start to add
muscle fibers at a very rapid clip so

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:36.800
muscle fibers at a very rapid clip so
 

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.260
muscle fibers at a very rapid clip so
that by the time they reach sexual

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:38.270
that by the time they reach sexual
 

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:41.260
that by the time they reach sexual
maturity males have perhaps about seven

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:41.270
maturity males have perhaps about seven
 

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:43.150
maturity males have perhaps about seven
times more muscle fibers and females

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:43.160
times more muscle fibers and females
 

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.540
times more muscle fibers and females
have and it's quite a marked difference

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:45.550
have and it's quite a marked difference
 

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:48.430
have and it's quite a marked difference
so male numbers are greater than female

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:48.440
so male numbers are greater than female
 

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.650
so male numbers are greater than female
numbers for the muscle fibers not

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:50.660
numbers for the muscle fibers not
 

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.320
numbers for the muscle fibers not
because fewer cells died but because

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:53.330
because fewer cells died but because
 

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:54.770
because fewer cells died but because
more cells are added

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:54.780
more cells are added
 

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.630
more cells are added
so there are two different kinds of

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640
so there are two different kinds of
 

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.120
so there are two different kinds of
ideas that are going on in males and

00:21:59.120 --> 00:21:59.130
ideas that are going on in males and
 

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:01.940
ideas that are going on in males and
females there's the process that leads

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:01.950
females there's the process that leads
 

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:03.620
females there's the process that leads
to differences in the brain where you

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:03.630
to differences in the brain where you
 

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.320
to differences in the brain where you
have less death and there's the process

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:06.330
have less death and there's the process
 

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:08.030
have less death and there's the process
that leads to differences in the vocal

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:08.040
that leads to differences in the vocal
 

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.670
that leads to differences in the vocal
organ where you have more cells formed

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:10.680
organ where you have more cells formed
 

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:14.060
organ where you have more cells formed
okay so we know now when all of these

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:14.070
okay so we know now when all of these
 

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:15.860
okay so we know now when all of these
differences occur we know something

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:15.870
differences occur we know something
 

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:18.230
differences occur we know something
about how but what we don't know is

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240
about how but what we don't know is
 

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.260
about how but what we don't know is
what's the signal that tells a brain or

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:21.270
what's the signal that tells a brain or
 

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:24.080
what's the signal that tells a brain or
a vocal organ to become male like or

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:24.090
a vocal organ to become male like or
 

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:26.480
a vocal organ to become male like or
female like during development so what

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:26.490
female like during development so what
 

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:28.670
female like during development so what
we would say is what's the mechanism

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:28.680
we would say is what's the mechanism
 

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:36.630
we would say is what's the mechanism
what's the biological mechanism

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640
 
 

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.120
 
and we've known for a long time from

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:39.130
and we've known for a long time from
 

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.490
and we've known for a long time from
studies actually in human beings that

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:41.500
studies actually in human beings that
 

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.680
studies actually in human beings that
steroid hormones and the ability to

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:43.690
steroid hormones and the ability to
 

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:46.289
steroid hormones and the ability to
respond to these steroid hormones are

00:22:46.289 --> 00:22:46.299
respond to these steroid hormones are
 

00:22:46.299 --> 00:22:49.410
respond to these steroid hormones are
one of the key driving factors in how

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:49.420
one of the key driving factors in how
 

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.750
one of the key driving factors in how
brains become male and female and the

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:51.760
brains become male and female and the
 

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.840
brains become male and female and the
sexual differentiation of the brain and

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:54.850
sexual differentiation of the brain and
 

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:57.870
sexual differentiation of the brain and
since this information was out there

00:22:57.870 --> 00:22:57.880
since this information was out there
 

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.990
since this information was out there
from mammals and for humans we decided

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:01.000
from mammals and for humans we decided
 

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.460
from mammals and for humans we decided
to go and see whether it was these

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:02.470
to go and see whether it was these
 

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.410
to go and see whether it was these
hormones that were responsible for

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:04.420
hormones that were responsible for
 

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.720
hormones that were responsible for
looking at differences in male and

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:06.730
looking at differences in male and
 

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.970
looking at differences in male and
female vocal organs and in their motor

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:08.980
female vocal organs and in their motor
 

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.130
female vocal organs and in their motor
neurons so let me tell you a little bit

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:11.140
neurons so let me tell you a little bit
 

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:13.140
neurons so let me tell you a little bit
about how these steroid hormones work

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:13.150
about how these steroid hormones work
 

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:14.220
about how these steroid hormones work
because they're not like a normal

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:14.230
because they're not like a normal
 

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:18.060
because they're not like a normal
hormone so let's take testes the testes

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:18.070
hormone so let's take testes the testes
 

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:19.860
hormone so let's take testes the testes
make a male sex hormone called

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:19.870
make a male sex hormone called
 

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:22.130
make a male sex hormone called
testosterone it's carried in the blood

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:22.140
testosterone it's carried in the blood
 

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.590
testosterone it's carried in the blood
down to a protein this brown substance

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600
down to a protein this brown substance
 

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.560
down to a protein this brown substance
here and then the steroid comes off and

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:28.570
here and then the steroid comes off and
 

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:30.360
here and then the steroid comes off and
it diffuses in the cell member it

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:30.370
it diffuses in the cell member it
 

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:31.650
it diffuses in the cell member it
actually dissolves from the cell

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:31.660
actually dissolves from the cell
 

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:34.770
actually dissolves from the cell
membrane it goes inside of the cell it's

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:34.780
membrane it goes inside of the cell it's
 

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.080
membrane it goes inside of the cell it's
picked up by a special protein called

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:37.090
picked up by a special protein called
 

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:40.530
picked up by a special protein called
the androgen receptor that whole complex

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:40.540
the androgen receptor that whole complex
 

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.570
the androgen receptor that whole complex
is carried into the nucleus of the cell

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:42.580
is carried into the nucleus of the cell
 

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.630
is carried into the nucleus of the cell
to these guys nestled down together on

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:45.640
to these guys nestled down together on
 

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.180
to these guys nestled down together on
the DNA bound to the hormone the

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:48.190
the DNA bound to the hormone the
 

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:50.100
the DNA bound to the hormone the
androgen receptor bound to the hormone

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:50.110
androgen receptor bound to the hormone
 

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:52.530
androgen receptor bound to the hormone
and they turn on gene transcription and

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:52.540
and they turn on gene transcription and
 

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.419
and they turn on gene transcription and
one of the reasons that we actually know

00:23:54.419 --> 00:23:54.429
one of the reasons that we actually know
 

00:23:54.429 --> 00:23:56.010
one of the reasons that we actually know
this picture pretty well is that there

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:56.020
this picture pretty well is that there
 

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.590
this picture pretty well is that there
are human mutants in which the system

00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:58.600
are human mutants in which the system
 

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.230
are human mutants in which the system
doesn't work they have male sex hormone

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:01.240
doesn't work they have male sex hormone
 

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.140
doesn't work they have male sex hormone
but their receptors are not capable of

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:04.150
but their receptors are not capable of
 

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:06.480
but their receptors are not capable of
turning on gene expression so these

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:06.490
turning on gene expression so these
 

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:08.700
turning on gene expression so these
individuals are often classified as

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:08.710
individuals are often classified as
 

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:11.700
individuals are often classified as
female at birth they grow up they can't

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:11.710
female at birth they grow up they can't
 

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:12.330
female at birth they grow up they can't
have kids

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:12.340
have kids
 

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.740
have kids
and it turns out that they're

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:13.750
and it turns out that they're
 

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:16.500
and it turns out that they're
genetically male they have testes they

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:16.510
genetically male they have testes they
 

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:18.659
genetically male they have testes they
make testosterone but they can't respond

00:24:18.659 --> 00:24:18.669
make testosterone but they can't respond
 

00:24:18.669 --> 00:24:21.030
make testosterone but they can't respond
to their own male sex hormone so I think

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:21.040
to their own male sex hormone so I think
 

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.250
to their own male sex hormone so I think
this is actually a very powerful example

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:23.260
this is actually a very powerful example
 

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.770
this is actually a very powerful example
of the important role of steroid

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:25.780
of the important role of steroid
 

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.720
of the important role of steroid
hormones and a lot of the molecular

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:27.730
hormones and a lot of the molecular
 

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:30.030
hormones and a lot of the molecular
biology of what we know about the

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:30.040
biology of what we know about the
 

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.159
biology of what we know about the
receptor actually comes from the

00:24:32.159 --> 00:24:32.169
receptor actually comes from the
 

00:24:32.169 --> 00:24:34.590
receptor actually comes from the
specific mutations in individuals with

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:34.600
specific mutations in individuals with
 

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:38.940
specific mutations in individuals with
androgen insensitivity syndrome so what

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:38.950
androgen insensitivity syndrome so what
 

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:41.490
androgen insensitivity syndrome so what
we did in this study in order to

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:41.500
we did in this study in order to
 

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.200
we did in this study in order to
determine whether the hormones were

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:43.210
determine whether the hormones were
 

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:47.130
determine whether the hormones were
involved was we used drugs anti

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:47.140
involved was we used drugs anti
 

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.440
involved was we used drugs anti
testosterones that bound to the receptor

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:49.450
testosterones that bound to the receptor
 

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:50.400
testosterones that bound to the receptor
but that

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:50.410
but that
 

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:53.010
but that
could not turn on gene expression and

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:53.020
could not turn on gene expression and
 

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.260
could not turn on gene expression and
these drugs are for example used in

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:55.270
these drugs are for example used in
 

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:57.150
these drugs are for example used in
prostate cancer which is hormone

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:57.160
prostate cancer which is hormone
 

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.280
prostate cancer which is hormone
sensitive these are pretty powerful they

00:24:59.280 --> 00:24:59.290
sensitive these are pretty powerful they
 

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:01.980
sensitive these are pretty powerful they
block the action of endogenous hormones

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:01.990
block the action of endogenous hormones
 

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:04.710
block the action of endogenous hormones
so what we did was we took the tadpoles

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720
so what we did was we took the tadpoles
 

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.470
so what we did was we took the tadpoles
and we grew them up either an anti

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:07.480
and we grew them up either an anti
 

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:11.130
and we grew them up either an anti
hormone or or we didn't interfere with

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:11.140
hormone or or we didn't interfere with
 

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.410
hormone or or we didn't interfere with
their development and what you predict

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:13.420
their development and what you predict
 

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.570
their development and what you predict
is that if the male sex hormone were

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:15.580
is that if the male sex hormone were
 

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.330
is that if the male sex hormone were
involved we should be able to reduce

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:18.340
involved we should be able to reduce
 

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:21.480
involved we should be able to reduce
male motor neuron numbers to female

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:21.490
male motor neuron numbers to female
 

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:23.760
male motor neuron numbers to female
levels and you can see that that works

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:23.770
levels and you can see that that works
 

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:26.180
levels and you can see that that works
in this slide so here we're looking at

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:26.190
in this slide so here we're looking at
 

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:28.830
in this slide so here we're looking at
tadpoles that were grown up either

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:28.840
tadpoles that were grown up either
 

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.370
tadpoles that were grown up either
normally so you're looking here at males

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:32.380
normally so you're looking here at males
 

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.010
normally so you're looking here at males
in it here at females or in the presence

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:35.020
in it here at females or in the presence
 

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:38.010
in it here at females or in the presence
of anti testosterone the name of the

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:38.020
of anti testosterone the name of the
 

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:41.250
of anti testosterone the name of the
drug is hydroxy flu tomate so here's the

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:41.260
drug is hydroxy flu tomate so here's the
 

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:42.990
drug is hydroxy flu tomate so here's the
normal sex difference in the number of

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:43.000
normal sex difference in the number of
 

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.600
normal sex difference in the number of
motor neurons and out here we concede

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:45.610
motor neurons and out here we concede
 

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:47.160
motor neurons and out here we concede
that the number of motor neurons in

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:47.170
that the number of motor neurons in
 

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.280
that the number of motor neurons in
males and in females is identical if we

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:50.290
males and in females is identical if we
 

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:54.060
males and in females is identical if we
block the action of the sex hormone how

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:54.070
block the action of the sex hormone how
 

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:56.040
block the action of the sex hormone how
about the muscle fibers the prediction

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:56.050
about the muscle fibers the prediction
 

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:58.410
about the muscle fibers the prediction
would be if we gave females male sex

00:25:58.410 --> 00:25:58.420
would be if we gave females male sex
 

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.660
would be if we gave females male sex
hormone they get more muscle fibers or

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:00.670
hormone they get more muscle fibers or
 

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:02.790
hormone they get more muscle fibers or
if we blocked hormone we should be able

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:02.800
if we blocked hormone we should be able
 

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.760
if we blocked hormone we should be able
to block muscle fiber addition so here's

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:05.770
to block muscle fiber addition so here's
 

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:07.920
to block muscle fiber addition so here's
an experiment where we gave female male

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:07.930
an experiment where we gave female male
 

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:09.960
an experiment where we gave female male
sex hormone we gave them testosterone

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:09.970
sex hormone we gave them testosterone
 

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:12.030
sex hormone we gave them testosterone
and you can see that the number of their

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:12.040
and you can see that the number of their
 

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.580
and you can see that the number of their
muscle fibers the error bars again

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:14.590
muscle fibers the error bars again
 

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:17.250
muscle fibers the error bars again
scientific habits of mind overlap in

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:17.260
scientific habits of mind overlap in
 

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.230
scientific habits of mind overlap in
male and female so we've been able to

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:19.240
male and female so we've been able to
 

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.060
male and female so we've been able to
get rid of the normal male female

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:21.070
get rid of the normal male female
 

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.100
get rid of the normal male female
difference and it turns out that you get

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:23.110
difference and it turns out that you get
 

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.380
difference and it turns out that you get
rid of it because fewer cells died in

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:25.390
rid of it because fewer cells died in
 

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:27.120
rid of it because fewer cells died in
females that are given the male sex

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:27.130
females that are given the male sex
 

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:31.500
females that are given the male sex
hormone so in order for the hormone to

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:31.510
hormone so in order for the hormone to
 

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:34.200
hormone so in order for the hormone to
work you would expect that both the

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:34.210
work you would expect that both the
 

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:36.540
work you would expect that both the
brain and the vocal organ would have

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:36.550
brain and the vocal organ would have
 

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:38.790
brain and the vocal organ would have
receptors for the hormone and you can

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:38.800
receptors for the hormone and you can
 

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.040
receptors for the hormone and you can
actually go and take a look at that once

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:41.050
actually go and take a look at that once
 

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:43.110
actually go and take a look at that once
you clone the gene for the receptor and

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.120
you clone the gene for the receptor and
 

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.210
you clone the gene for the receptor and
what you see here is a cross-section

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:45.220
what you see here is a cross-section
 

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:48.360
what you see here is a cross-section
through the vocal organ and here in this

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:48.370
through the vocal organ and here in this
 

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:50.220
through the vocal organ and here in this
little itty-bitty piece of tissue right

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:50.230
little itty-bitty piece of tissue right
 

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:54.270
little itty-bitty piece of tissue right
in here you see a very bright area

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:54.280
in here you see a very bright area
 

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:57.210
in here you see a very bright area
lighting up here and here the bright

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:57.220
lighting up here and here the bright
 

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.430
lighting up here and here the bright
area in the middle here are the stem

00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440
area in the middle here are the stem
 

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.160
area in the middle here are the stem
cells that are going to make cartilage

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:01.170
cells that are going to make cartilage
 

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:04.100
cells that are going to make cartilage
so stem cells in the developing vocal

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:04.110
so stem cells in the developing vocal
 

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:06.290
so stem cells in the developing vocal
organ are extremely sensitive to hormone

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:06.300
organ are extremely sensitive to hormone
 

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.120
organ are extremely sensitive to hormone
because they've got lots of the receptor

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:08.130
because they've got lots of the receptor
 

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:10.250
because they've got lots of the receptor
and out here this bright area is the

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:10.260
and out here this bright area is the
 

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.030
and out here this bright area is the
developing muscle and muscle stem cells

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:13.040
developing muscle and muscle stem cells
 

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.730
developing muscle and muscle stem cells
myoblasts are extremely sensitive to

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:15.740
myoblasts are extremely sensitive to
 

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.980
myoblasts are extremely sensitive to
developing sex hormone and here in the

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:18.990
developing sex hormone and here in the
 

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:21.350
developing sex hormone and here in the
brain it turns out the expression of the

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360
brain it turns out the expression of the
 

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.060
brain it turns out the expression of the
receptors like a staying for the whole

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:23.070

these singing motor neurons expresses

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:32.460
these singing motor neurons expresses
 

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.760
these singing motor neurons expresses
the protein that enables them to respond

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:34.770
the protein that enables them to respond
 

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:37.520
the protein that enables them to respond
to male sex hormone so this is a good

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:37.530
to male sex hormone so this is a good
 

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:40.610

a moment into the Britain and talk about

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:03.030
a moment into the Britain and talk about
 

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:04.910
a moment into the Britain and talk about
how the brain produces some of these

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:04.920
how the brain produces some of these
 

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.130
how the brain produces some of these
vocal patterns and how do you use a

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:07.140
vocal patterns and how do you use a
 

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.530

males and females and you'll recognize

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:13.410
males and females and you'll recognize
 

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:15.650
males and females and you'll recognize
here that we're going after the

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:15.660
here that we're going after the
 

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.960
here that we're going after the
astonishing hypothesis we want to look

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:17.970
astonishing hypothesis we want to look
 

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:20.750
astonishing hypothesis we want to look
at brain activity that's responsible for

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760
at brain activity that's responsible for
 

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.750
at brain activity that's responsible for
the production of a behavior so one of

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760
the production of a behavior so one of
 

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.120
the production of a behavior so one of
the nice things about frogs is that

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:26.130
the nice things about frogs is that
 

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:28.970
the nice things about frogs is that
they're very strongly motivated to sing

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:28.980
they're very strongly motivated to sing
 

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.430
they're very strongly motivated to sing
so we can put electrodes around the

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440
so we can put electrodes around the
 

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.310
so we can put electrodes around the
nerve of the frog as it's singing this

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320
nerve of the frog as it's singing this
 

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.470
nerve of the frog as it's singing this
is the nerve that goes to the vocal

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480
is the nerve that goes to the vocal
 

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.630
is the nerve that goes to the vocal
organ and we can record the activity

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640
organ and we can record the activity
 

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.880
organ and we can record the activity
that's coming out from the brain while

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:40.890
that's coming out from the brain while
 

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:43.250
that's coming out from the brain while
the animal is singing and that's enabled

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:43.260
the animal is singing and that's enabled
 

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.190
the animal is singing and that's enabled
us to do a lot of useful studies and but

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:46.200
us to do a lot of useful studies and but
 

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.090
us to do a lot of useful studies and but
one of the things that's so

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:47.100
one of the things that's so
 

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.820
one of the things that's so
extraordinary about it is that every

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:49.830
extraordinary about it is that every
 

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:52.490
extraordinary about it is that every
burst of activity in the nerve matches a

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:52.500
burst of activity in the nerve matches a
 

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.950
burst of activity in the nerve matches a
sound that's produced by the animal so

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960
sound that's produced by the animal so
 

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.690
sound that's produced by the animal so
here we're looking at electrical

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:56.700
here we're looking at electrical
 

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.690
here we're looking at electrical
activity in the nerve down here and a

00:28:59.690 --> 00:28:59.700
activity in the nerve down here and a
 

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.210
activity in the nerve down here and a
female so here's the nerve activity and

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:02.220
female so here's the nerve activity and
 

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.890
female so here's the nerve activity and
here's the sound that's produced on the

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:03.900
here's the sound that's produced on the
 

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.230
here's the sound that's produced on the
upper trace nerve activity and sound

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240
upper trace nerve activity and sound
 

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.600
upper trace nerve activity and sound
that's produced so while this female is

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:08.610
that's produced so while this female is
 

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:12.050
that's produced so while this female is
ticking each tick is accompanied by a

ticking each tick is accompanied by a
 

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:15.860
ticking each tick is accompanied by a
burst of nerve activity and the pattern

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:15.870
burst of nerve activity and the pattern
 

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:18.980
burst of nerve activity and the pattern
of the nerve activity perfectly matches

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:18.990
of the nerve activity perfectly matches
 

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:21.830
of the nerve activity perfectly matches
the pattern that the sound is produced

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840
the pattern that the sound is produced
 

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.340
the pattern that the sound is produced
in and in a more complicated way we can

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:25.350
in and in a more complicated way we can
 

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:27.080
in and in a more complicated way we can
do the same recording from the nail

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:27.090
do the same recording from the nail
 

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:30.800
do the same recording from the nail
while his advertisement calling and you

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:30.810
while his advertisement calling and you
 

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:32.750
while his advertisement calling and you
can see that each burst of nerve

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:32.760
can see that each burst of nerve
 

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.570
can see that each burst of nerve
activity is accompanied by a click and

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:35.580
activity is accompanied by a click and
 

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:38.600
activity is accompanied by a click and
as the burst of nerve activity gets get

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:38.610
as the burst of nerve activity gets get
 

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:40.970
as the burst of nerve activity gets get
louder the clicks get ladder there's an

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:40.980
louder the clicks get ladder there's an
 

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.250
louder the clicks get ladder there's an
exact match between what's coming out of

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:43.260
exact match between what's coming out of
 

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.350
exact match between what's coming out of
the brain and the song that the animal

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360
the brain and the song that the animal
 

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.890
the brain and the song that the animal
is singing so we used this method and

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:48.900
is singing so we used this method and
 

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.410
is singing so we used this method and
other methods to go into the brain and

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:51.420
other methods to go into the brain and
 

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:53.570
other methods to go into the brain and
to take a look at the neural networks

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:53.580
to take a look at the neural networks
 

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.700
to take a look at the neural networks
that are responsible for the production

we put recording electrodes in to look
 

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:06.350
we put recording electrodes in to look
at electrical activity and eventually

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:06.360
at electrical activity and eventually
 

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.360
at electrical activity and eventually

so in zenefits each species has its own
song they're about 23 species that we

00:31:30.089 --> 00:31:30.099
song they're about 23 species that we
 

00:31:30.099 --> 00:31:32.549
song they're about 23 species that we
know of we discovered we think a new one

00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559
know of we discovered we think a new one
 

00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:35.849
know of we discovered we think a new one
a couple of weeks ago and each species

00:31:35.849 --> 00:31:35.859
a couple of weeks ago and each species
 

00:31:35.859 --> 00:31:38.939
a couple of weeks ago and each species
has a very distinct song so for example

00:31:38.939 --> 00:31:38.949
has a very distinct song so for example
 

00:31:38.949 --> 00:31:40.979
has a very distinct song so for example
this is one of the new ones that we just

00:31:40.979 --> 00:31:40.989
this is one of the new ones that we just
 

00:31:40.989 --> 00:31:42.689
this is one of the new ones that we just
discovered that was just published and

00:31:42.689 --> 00:31:42.699
discovered that was just published and
 

00:31:42.699 --> 00:31:44.639
discovered that was just published and
we may have another one so lay this

00:31:44.639 --> 00:31:44.649
we may have another one so lay this
 

00:31:44.649 --> 00:31:51.319
we may have another one so lay this
you'll remember it goes like this and

00:31:51.319 --> 00:31:51.329
 
 

00:31:51.329 --> 00:31:54.749
 
then down here here's another Xenopus

00:31:54.749 --> 00:31:54.759
then down here here's another Xenopus
 

00:31:54.759 --> 00:31:56.909
then down here here's another Xenopus
species called borealis that has a very

00:31:56.909 --> 00:31:56.919
species called borealis that has a very
 

00:31:56.919 --> 00:32:12.209
species called borealis that has a very
different song so these two songs are

00:32:12.209 --> 00:32:12.219
different song so these two songs are
 

00:32:12.219 --> 00:32:13.889
different song so these two songs are
very different and because they're very

00:32:13.889 --> 00:32:13.899
very different and because they're very
 

00:32:13.899 --> 00:32:15.479
very different and because they're very
different we can actually do an

00:32:15.479 --> 00:32:15.489
different we can actually do an
 

00:32:15.489 --> 00:32:17.159
different we can actually do an
experiment that would be hard to do in

00:32:17.159 --> 00:32:17.169
experiment that would be hard to do in
 

00:32:17.169 --> 00:32:19.889
experiment that would be hard to do in
other animals we can switch the

00:32:19.889 --> 00:32:19.899
other animals we can switch the
 

00:32:19.899 --> 00:32:22.109
other animals we can switch the
circuitry between two different species

00:32:22.109 --> 00:32:22.119
circuitry between two different species
 

00:32:22.119 --> 00:32:25.049
circuitry between two different species
when the animals are in tadpole stages

00:32:25.049 --> 00:32:25.059
when the animals are in tadpole stages
 

00:32:25.059 --> 00:32:27.389
when the animals are in tadpole stages
and we can create what we call a chimera

00:32:27.389 --> 00:32:27.399
and we can create what we call a chimera
 

00:32:27.399 --> 00:32:30.239
and we can create what we call a chimera
so this is an animal that has part of

00:32:30.239 --> 00:32:30.249
so this is an animal that has part of
 

00:32:30.249 --> 00:32:33.269
so this is an animal that has part of
its brain from one species and another

00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:33.279
its brain from one species and another
 

00:32:33.279 --> 00:32:36.209
its brain from one species and another
part of its braid from another species

00:32:36.209 --> 00:32:36.219
part of its braid from another species
 

00:32:36.219 --> 00:32:38.549
part of its braid from another species
and you let me just show you how you do

00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559
and you let me just show you how you do
 

00:32:38.559 --> 00:32:40.499
and you let me just show you how you do
that so you take the embryo when it's

00:32:40.499 --> 00:32:40.509
that so you take the embryo when it's
 

00:32:40.509 --> 00:32:43.289
that so you take the embryo when it's
about 24 hours old before there are any

00:32:43.289 --> 00:32:43.299
about 24 hours old before there are any
 

00:32:43.299 --> 00:32:45.689
about 24 hours old before there are any
nerve cells whatsoever so there's no

00:32:45.689 --> 00:32:45.699
nerve cells whatsoever so there's no
 

00:32:45.699 --> 00:32:48.899
nerve cells whatsoever so there's no
chance that it can feel any pain and

00:32:48.899 --> 00:32:48.909
chance that it can feel any pain and
 

00:32:48.909 --> 00:32:51.839
chance that it can feel any pain and
then what you do is you switch the front

00:32:51.839 --> 00:32:51.849
then what you do is you switch the front
 

00:32:51.849 --> 00:32:54.359
then what you do is you switch the front
parts of the embryo and you put the

00:32:54.359 --> 00:32:54.369
parts of the embryo and you put the
 

00:32:54.369 --> 00:32:57.119
parts of the embryo and you put the
borealis front hindbrain and the

00:32:57.119 --> 00:32:57.129
borealis front hindbrain and the
 

00:32:57.129 --> 00:32:59.879
borealis front hindbrain and the
structures that are in that part on the

00:32:59.879 --> 00:32:59.889
structures that are in that part on the
 

00:32:59.889 --> 00:33:03.749
structures that are in that part on the
latest back part and vice versa and you

00:33:03.749 --> 00:33:03.759
latest back part and vice versa and you
 

00:33:03.759 --> 00:33:06.509
latest back part and vice versa and you
let these guys grow up and you ask the

00:33:06.509 --> 00:33:06.519
let these guys grow up and you ask the
 

00:33:06.519 --> 00:33:13.850
let these guys grow up and you ask the
question of what they sing

00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:13.860
 
 

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:16.380
 
when they grow up this is the way they

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:16.390
when they grow up this is the way they
 

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:20.549
when they grow up this is the way they
look they have part of them the front

00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:20.559
look they have part of them the front
 

00:33:20.559 --> 00:33:22.500
look they have part of them the front
part comes from borealis it turns out

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:22.510
part comes from borealis it turns out
 

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:24.480
part comes from borealis it turns out
that the chimeras worked mostly in one

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:24.490
that the chimeras worked mostly in one
 

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:27.510
that the chimeras worked mostly in one
direction so here's two animals with

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:27.520
direction so here's two animals with
 

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:29.730
direction so here's two animals with
front parts from borealis the skin is a

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:29.740
front parts from borealis the skin is a
 

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:30.870
front parts from borealis the skin is a
little bit darker

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880
little bit darker
 

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.910
little bit darker
this guy mostly has the skin around the

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:32.920
this guy mostly has the skin around the
 

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.130
this guy mostly has the skin around the
eyes and all the rest of the animal is

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:35.140
eyes and all the rest of the animal is
 

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.770
eyes and all the rest of the animal is
latest actually the vocal organ is also

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:37.780
latest actually the vocal organ is also
 

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:40.409
latest actually the vocal organ is also
borealis so then we can ask these

00:33:40.409 --> 00:33:40.419
borealis so then we can ask these
 

00:33:40.419 --> 00:33:42.539
borealis so then we can ask these
animals who want to sing when they're

00:33:42.539 --> 00:33:42.549
animals who want to sing when they're
 

00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:44.580
animals who want to sing when they're
about a year old what kind of song they

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:44.590
about a year old what kind of song they
 

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:46.919
about a year old what kind of song they
sing now in order to do this experiment

00:33:46.919 --> 00:33:46.929
sing now in order to do this experiment
 

00:33:46.929 --> 00:33:48.810
sing now in order to do this experiment
you actually needed control because it's

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:48.820
you actually needed control because it's
 

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:50.789
you actually needed control because it's
possible that if they sing a goofy song

00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:50.799
possible that if they sing a goofy song
 

00:33:50.799 --> 00:33:53.310
possible that if they sing a goofy song
it was just because of the surgery that

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:53.320
it was just because of the surgery that
 

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.830
it was just because of the surgery that
you use to create the chimera so we also

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:55.840
you use to create the chimera so we also
 

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.320
you use to create the chimera so we also
created chimeras between two different

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:58.330
created chimeras between two different
 

00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:01.289
created chimeras between two different
embryos that were both lavis or both

00:34:01.289 --> 00:34:01.299
embryos that were both lavis or both
 

00:34:01.299 --> 00:34:04.320
embryos that were both lavis or both
borealis and the latest chimeras made

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:04.330
borealis and the latest chimeras made
 

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:07.530
borealis and the latest chimeras made
songs that sounded like this so they

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:07.540
songs that sounded like this so they
 

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:12.030
songs that sounded like this so they
made a completely normal song and the

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:12.040
made a completely normal song and the
 

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:22.310
made a completely normal song and the
borealis made songs that sound like this

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320
 
 

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.159
 
so the transplants themselves didn't

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:26.169
so the transplants themselves didn't
 

00:34:26.169 --> 00:34:27.960
so the transplants themselves didn't
seem to affect the ability of the

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:27.970
seem to affect the ability of the
 

00:34:27.970 --> 00:34:30.450
seem to affect the ability of the
animals to sing when they grew up so

00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:30.460
animals to sing when they grew up so
 

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:32.520
animals to sing when they grew up so
what about an animal that had the front

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:32.530
what about an animal that had the front
 

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:34.139
what about an animal that had the front
part of the hindbrain circuit from

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:34.149
part of the hindbrain circuit from
 

00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:36.540
part of the hindbrain circuit from
borealis and had the back part of the

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:36.550
borealis and had the back part of the
 

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:38.730
borealis and had the back part of the
hindbrain circuit from Lavis what did it

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:38.740
hindbrain circuit from Lavis what did it
 

00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:41.190
hindbrain circuit from Lavis what did it
song sound like this is an experiment

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200
song sound like this is an experiment
 

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:55.560
song sound like this is an experiment
that was done in my lab by Brian Shaw

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:55.570
 
 

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:59.980
 
so in that animal what you hear is a

00:34:59.980 --> 00:34:59.990
so in that animal what you hear is a
 

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:01.810
so in that animal what you hear is a
vocal pattern with an inner click

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:01.820
vocal pattern with an inner click
 

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:04.050
vocal pattern with an inner click
interval the one that predominates is

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:04.060
interval the one that predominates is
 

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.820
interval the one that predominates is
identical to the borealis vocal pattern

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:06.830
identical to the borealis vocal pattern
 

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:08.680
identical to the borealis vocal pattern
there are these funky little extra

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:08.690
there are these funky little extra
 

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:10.120
there are these funky little extra
clicks we don't know where they come

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:10.130
clicks we don't know where they come
 

00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:12.580
clicks we don't know where they come
from but the dominant pattern that's

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:12.590
from but the dominant pattern that's
 

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:14.530
from but the dominant pattern that's
driving the production of the song in

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:14.540
driving the production of the song in
 

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:17.530
driving the production of the song in
this animal is coming from borealis so

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:17.540
this animal is coming from borealis so
 

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:19.930
this animal is coming from borealis so
one interpretation of this experiment

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:19.940
one interpretation of this experiment
 

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.300
one interpretation of this experiment
it's not the only one but it's a

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:22.310
it's not the only one but it's a
 

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:24.580
it's not the only one but it's a
reasonable one is that the pattern is

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:24.590
reasonable one is that the pattern is
 

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:27.220
reasonable one is that the pattern is
created by the anterior Circuit's up

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:27.230
created by the anterior Circuit's up
 

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:31.120
created by the anterior Circuit's up
here but the rate is shaped by posterior

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:31.130
here but the rate is shaped by posterior
 

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:33.940
here but the rate is shaped by posterior
circuits and the vocal muscles and these

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:33.950
circuits and the vocal muscles and these
 

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:36.280
circuits and the vocal muscles and these
animals actually had borealis muscles

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:36.290
animals actually had borealis muscles
 

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:38.950
animals actually had borealis muscles
that can only contract rather slowly so

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960
that can only contract rather slowly so
 

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.020
that can only contract rather slowly so
you have a complicated situation where

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:41.030
you have a complicated situation where
 

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:44.020
you have a complicated situation where
you have the rhythm which is generated

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:44.030
you have the rhythm which is generated
 

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:46.090
you have the rhythm which is generated
by one portion of the circuit and the

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:46.100
by one portion of the circuit and the
 

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:48.400
by one portion of the circuit and the
ability to contract and relax rapidly

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:48.410
ability to contract and relax rapidly
 

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:50.650
ability to contract and relax rapidly
which is generated by the motor neurons

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:50.660
which is generated by the motor neurons
 

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.750
which is generated by the motor neurons
and the hind brain circuit then this is

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:52.760
and the hind brain circuit then this is
 

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.490
and the hind brain circuit then this is
a kind of taking a part of a neural

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:54.500
a kind of taking a part of a neural
 

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.010
a kind of taking a part of a neural
circuit that's very hard to do in any

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:57.020
circuit that's very hard to do in any
 

00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:04.349
circuit that's very hard to do in any
other kind of system

00:36:04.349 --> 00:36:04.359

that we discovered a new calling

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:50.510
that we discovered a new calling
 

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:53.170
that we discovered a new calling
behavior that we'd never seen before

male and I can show you this most easily
and also point out the context in which

00:38:10.839 --> 00:38:10.849
and also point out the context in which
 

00:38:10.849 --> 00:38:13.839
and also point out the context in which
these calls occur by showing you this

00:38:13.839 --> 00:38:13.849
these calls occur by showing you this
 

00:38:13.849 --> 00:38:16.900
these calls occur by showing you this
movie so here we're in the lab and we

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:16.910
movie so here we're in the lab and we
 

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:20.230
movie so here we're in the lab and we
got a mail clasping of female and what's

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240
got a mail clasping of female and what's
 

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.540
got a mail clasping of female and what's
gonna happen is he's going on a ride or

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:22.550
gonna happen is he's going on a ride or
 

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:24.550

rather she's going tick tick tick tick

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560
rather she's going tick tick tick tick
 

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.340
rather she's going tick tick tick tick
tick what happens eventually is that her

tick what happens eventually is that her
 

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:29.950

ticking suppresses his vocal behavior so

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:29.960
ticking suppresses his vocal behavior so
 

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.320
ticking suppresses his vocal behavior so
he shuts up and then just for a second

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:32.330
he shuts up and then just for a second
 

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:34.270
he shuts up and then just for a second
she cause a little bit faster and he

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:34.280
she cause a little bit faster and he
 

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.550
she cause a little bit faster and he
gets all excited again she goes back to

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:36.560
gets all excited again she goes back to
 

00:38:36.560 --> 00:39:14.920
gets all excited again she goes back to
ticking and he shuts up so what we

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:14.930
ticking and he shuts up so what we
 

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:17.530
ticking and he shuts up so what we
discovered by going to Africa was not

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:17.540
discovered by going to Africa was not
 

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:19.870
discovered by going to Africa was not
only a new call that females made not

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:19.880
only a new call that females made not
 

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:22.990
only a new call that females made not
just ticking which you know before but

00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:23.000
just ticking which you know before but
 

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.390
just ticking which you know before but
also a new social interaction so here's

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:25.400
also a new social interaction so here's
 

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.340
also a new social interaction so here's
ticking which is the female call that we

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:27.350
ticking which is the female call that we
 

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:32.590
ticking which is the female call that we
had studied before and here's the call

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:32.600
had studied before and here's the call
 

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:34.450
had studied before and here's the call
that we first heard in the female where

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:34.460
that we first heard in the female where
 

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.070
that we first heard in the female where
she couldn't find a male when she was

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:36.080
she couldn't find a male when she was
 

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:39.040
she couldn't find a male when she was
about to lay her eggs and we called this

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:39.050
about to lay her eggs and we called this
 

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:43.690
about to lay her eggs and we called this
call rapping sounds like machine-gun

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:43.700
call rapping sounds like machine-gun
 

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:48.340
call rapping sounds like machine-gun
fire rapid Geiger counter so these calls

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:48.350
fire rapid Geiger counter so these calls
 

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:50.080
fire rapid Geiger counter so these calls
have very different effects on the

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:50.090
have very different effects on the
 

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:53.320
have very different effects on the
male's behavior what happens to a male

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:53.330
male's behavior what happens to a male
 

00:39:53.330 --> 00:40:02.410
male's behavior what happens to a male
that hears ticking is that he shuts up

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:02.420
 
 

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:06.560
 
so that's vocal suppression and rapping

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:06.570
so that's vocal suppression and rapping
 

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:09.829
so that's vocal suppression and rapping
on the other hand functions as a vocal

00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839
on the other hand functions as a vocal

00:40:42.869 --> 00:40:46.099
excitement that's produced by female
calling so I mentioned a minute ago that

00:40:46.099 --> 00:40:46.109
calling so I mentioned a minute ago that
 

00:40:46.109 --> 00:40:48.349
calling so I mentioned a minute ago that
when we went out to the ponds we only

00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359
when we went out to the ponds we only
 

00:40:48.359 --> 00:40:50.599
when we went out to the ponds we only
often heard one male calling and yet

00:40:50.599 --> 00:40:50.609
often heard one male calling and yet
 

00:40:50.609 --> 00:40:52.579
often heard one male calling and yet
when we pulled those funnel traps out of

00:40:52.579 --> 00:40:52.589
when we pulled those funnel traps out of
 

00:40:52.589 --> 00:40:54.380
when we pulled those funnel traps out of
the ponds there were thousands and

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:54.390
the ponds there were thousands and
 

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:56.420
the ponds there were thousands and
thousands of males in a particular pond

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:56.430
thousands of males in a particular pond
 

00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:58.670
thousands of males in a particular pond
so how come only one male calls at a

00:40:58.670 --> 00:40:58.680
so how come only one male calls at a
 

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.920
so how come only one male calls at a
time so when we bought the animals back

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:00.930
time so when we bought the animals back
 

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:03.020
time so when we bought the animals back
to the lab we began to have some insight

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:03.030
to the lab we began to have some insight
 

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:05.480
to the lab we began to have some insight
into that and let me just show you how

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:05.490
into that and let me just show you how
 

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:07.400
into that and let me just show you how
that works and you'll notice how much

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:07.410
that works and you'll notice how much
 

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:09.410
that works and you'll notice how much
more energetic this interaction between

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:09.420
more energetic this interaction between
 

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:11.270
more energetic this interaction between
the males is than the interaction

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280
the males is than the interaction
 

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.160
the males is than the interaction
between the males and the females so

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:13.170
between the males and the females so
 

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:14.930
between the males and the females so
here's a female and here are two males

00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:14.940
here's a female and here are two males
 

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:17.059
here's a female and here are two males
and we're going to see them calling

00:41:17.059 --> 00:41:17.069
and we're going to see them calling
 

00:41:17.069 --> 00:41:18.530
and we're going to see them calling
we're going to see them ignore the

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:18.540
we're going to see them ignore the
 

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.120
we're going to see them ignore the
female and we're going to see them

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:20.130
female and we're going to see them
 

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:22.550
female and we're going to see them
interacting in a very vigorous vocal

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560
interacting in a very vigorous vocal
 

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:45.350
interacting in a very vigorous vocal
fashion

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:51.680
 
okay now they face off

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:51.690
 
 

00:41:51.690 --> 00:42:03.470
 
one of the nails start to add calling

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480
 
 

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:06.530
 
this guy comes over to its clasp in him

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:06.540

displacing the other male and the way we
think that it happens in the ponds is

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:27.250
think that it happens in the ponds is
 

00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:29.670
think that it happens in the ponds is
that they live together in these crowded

time so the males are always ready to go
 

00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:43.410
time so the males are always ready to go
but there very few females that are

but there very few females that are
 

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:45.720
but there very few females that are
ready to lay their eggs so here's a

ready to lay their eggs so here's a
 

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:48.120

she wraps he calls they get together and

the payoff is the production of tadpoles

00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:08.620
the payoff is the production of tadpoles

the payoff is the production of tadpoles
in the population of the ponds so this I

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:13.390
in the population of the ponds so this I
 

00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:15.600
in the population of the ponds so this I
think is actually an example of the

think is actually an example of the
 

00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:17.580
think is actually an example of the
magnification principle that we talked

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:17.590
magnification principle that we talked
 

00:45:17.590 --> 00:45:20.190
magnification principle that we talked
about in the first lecture here's an

00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:20.200
about in the first lecture here's an
 

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.940
about in the first lecture here's an
animal whose entire life is acoustic

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:22.950
animal whose entire life is acoustic
 

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:25.470
animal whose entire life is acoustic
whose entire form of social

00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:25.480
whose entire form of social
 

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:27.630
whose entire form of social
communication aside from classroom each

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:27.640
communication aside from classroom each
 

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:30.540
communication aside from classroom each
other lies in the vocal realm and then

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:30.550
other lies in the vocal realm and then
 

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:32.970
other lies in the vocal realm and then
this animal the way that the nervous

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:32.980
this animal the way that the nervous
 

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:35.130
this animal the way that the nervous
system is connected to connect what an

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:35.140
system is connected to connect what an
 

00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:37.230
system is connected to connect what an
animal hears and what an animal produces

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:37.240
animal hears and what an animal produces
 

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:40.320
animal hears and what an animal produces
is very highly exaggerated and very

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:40.330
is very highly exaggerated and very
 

00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:42.450
is very highly exaggerated and very
powerful and it makes this kind of a

00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:42.460
powerful and it makes this kind of a
 

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:44.520
powerful and it makes this kind of a
system very good not only for

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:44.530
system very good not only for
 

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:46.790
system very good not only for
discovering what it is that drives

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800
discovering what it is that drives
 

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:49.530
discovering what it is that drives
differences in the ability of males and

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:49.540
differences in the ability of males and
 

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:51.660
differences in the ability of males and
females to make different vocal patterns

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:51.670
females to make different vocal patterns
 

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:54.690
females to make different vocal patterns
what it is genetically that drives the

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:54.700
what it is genetically that drives the
 

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:56.340
what it is genetically that drives the
different vocal patterns across the

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:56.350
different vocal patterns across the
 

00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:59.190
different vocal patterns across the
species but also what drives the ability

00:45:59.190 --> 00:45:59.200
species but also what drives the ability
 

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.110
species but also what drives the ability
of two brains to communicate with each

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:01.120
of two brains to communicate with each
 

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.420
of two brains to communicate with each
other which is going to be the topic of

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:03.430
other which is going to be the topic of
 

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:05.490
other which is going to be the topic of
the third lecture in this series on the

00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:05.500
the third lecture in this series on the
 

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:15.000
the third lecture in this series on the
evolution of language thank you

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:15.010
