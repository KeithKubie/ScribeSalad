00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.740
REBECCA LAZIER: The
Journey to the West

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.880
is iconic landmark story
of Chinese culture.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.230
And many of the students
in their applications

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.840
wrote, I grew up listening,
hearing these stories,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.870
telling these stories.


00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.620
I mean, these go back
to the Ming Dynasty.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.960
Our production is
Fred's Act Four.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.750
It's called Journey
Beyond the West.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.860
The pilgrims, the
priest, and the ogre,

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.670
and the pig, and
the monkey king are

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.630
about to receive
these final scrolls.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.920
And Fred inserts
that his home has

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.380
been destroyed by
the Jade Emperor.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.020
And he has to go back
and avenge himself.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.840
And it ends up being
an avenge story where

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.230
the monkey king is victorious.


00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.840
And so this is completely
against any traditional telling

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.820
of the story.


00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.140
So I think that's also very
exciting for the students.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.200
SCOTT PARKER: We bring in
a lot of basic martial arts

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.220
that maybe anybody that's
done kung fu will know.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.010
And then, as well
as that, we bring

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.260
it more contemporary to add some
movement and different things

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.000
that's new to everybody.


00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.840
Even a well-seasoned martial
arts person or practitioner

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.190
will look at what we're
doing and be like, wow.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.950
I've never seen anything
like that before.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.450
NATHAN LAM: We drill
through basics.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.970
And in wushu, basics
are always the hardest.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.000
If you're 10 years old,
you're doing basics.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.110
If you're 40 years old,
you're doing basics.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.010
And Scott really interested in
how to drill that part into it.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.230
It was amazing seeing other
people who haven't done wushu

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.450
before coming and really
take up the sport so quickly.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.270
Because it's something
that's very, very hard,

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.050
and people usually start
at a really young age.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.560
And they were able to just
pick it up and learn it.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.390
REBECCA LAZIER: It's
the first time anything

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.390
like this has been done at
Princeton, both in terms

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.020
of inclusion of martial arts
within a choreographic setting

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.880
within the Lewis
Center for the Arts,

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.280
and then taking something that
is such a dynamic intersection

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.180
of many different cultures
and bringing it to life.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.640
EDWARD LEUNG: I saw this on
the course list, and I thought,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.060
this is a dream class for me.


00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.000
I always want to do
wushu, but I never

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.640
had the opportunity to
explore it before college.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.250
And I loved the cross-genre
aspect of this class

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.460
because it fuses music as well
as sociology, anthropology,

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.570
and wushu into
this 35-minute act.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.430
SCOTT PARKER: To bring wushu
to people that have never

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.370
done it before, and to
see them get excited,

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.100
and to see them see these little
things that we do-- and I'm

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.930
showing them things.


00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.990
And we go over and
go over and go over.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.270
To see that, for me,
is the biggest joy.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.860
And to be able to give that
now to students at Princeton

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.290
here with the Lewis Center
at the Atelier program

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.780
has really been, I mean,
just a dream come true.
