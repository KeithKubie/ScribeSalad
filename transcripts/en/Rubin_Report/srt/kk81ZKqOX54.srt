1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,190
[inaudible]

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,460
joining me today is the
founder for act for America,

3
00:00:07,461 --> 00:00:12,120
a New York Times bestselling author and
author of the new book rise in defense

4
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:16,010
of Judeo Christian values and
freedom. Brigitte. Gabriel,

5
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,390
welcome back to the Rubin report.

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,990
Thank you Dave.
I'm delighted to be back with you.

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,620
I am delighted that you're here.
First off, before we do anything else,

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,150
I was going to wear the exact same shirt.

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,680
I love this shirt.
That's a girly girly shirts

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,880
that is a girly girly shirt. I
love what's going on here. Okay,

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,570
so I had you on about maybe
a year and a half ago or so,

12
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,870
you are the only person in the history
of the Ruben report that you caused the

13
00:00:40,601 --> 00:00:45,400
tear to to formulate in my,
I think you know exactly when it happened.

14
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,000
Yeah, so before I even let you say
anything, we're throwing to the clip.

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,920
We only take care of freedom and
preserve it to the next generation.

16
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,160
And I am doing my part as an American,

17
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:03,030
as a brave American and the home of
the brave to make sure I follow in the

18
00:01:03,161 --> 00:01:05,170
footsteps of our founding fathers.

19
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:10,710
And do my part as they entrusted me
with that which they have created.

20
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:14,290
I feel it is my duty to
make sure to preserve it,

21
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:18,730
to pass it to my children and their
American children and many generations to

22
00:01:18,731 --> 00:01:23,590
come. That's why we fight. And I am
so fortunate that through this fight,

23
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,120
and it is a fight for freedom, for
liberty, for democracy, for security,

24
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,410
for human rights.

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,660
I am privileged to meet the most amazing
people that I would never otherwise

26
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:38,230
meet, like sitting here
with you today. Uh,

27
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,260
and meet friends that have
become lifelong friends,

28
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,320
literally like family to me that I would
never have otherwise met if it wasn't

29
00:01:46,721 --> 00:01:50,290
doing for what I do.
So do I get depressed doing what I do?

30
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,810
Talking about terrorism and
national security, of course I do.

31
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,930
I'm human like everybody.
Sometimes I cry.

32
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,320
Sometimes I'm completely depressed
over things that are happening.

33
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,980
Sometimes I hurt deeply by people who
stabbed me in the back or say bad things

34
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:05,230
about me or even reading
my Wikipedia profile.

35
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,450
But what keeps me so energized is the
American people and the American spirit

36
00:02:10,451 --> 00:02:13,450
knowing that we are making a difference.
We are growing,

37
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:17,230
we are changing our country, we
are fighting, we have a purpose.

38
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,390
So when you and I die on our death bed,

39
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:24,391
we can look back and we can say I made
a difference as we take our last breath

40
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,440
and that's enough for me.

41
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,610
That is how you end an interview. I
mean that's it right there. That was,

42
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,530
that was like your opus right there.

43
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,370
Well because I spoke from the heart
and when you speak from the heart,

44
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,440
your message resonates with people.

45
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,060
And this is exactly why people like you
and me are having such traction with a

46
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:47,510
lot of people who are saying
we love what you're saying.

47
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,690
It's about time that somebody will
say the things that you are saying,

48
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,280
our message is resonating.

49
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,240
And you know why people want something
genuine and they can tell, you know,

50
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,830
I always tell my children,
the one thing you can never love,

51
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,430
you can never fake glove.
Pico people can tell when you're genuine.

52
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,760
And in a world that we live in
today where everything is fake,

53
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,230
everything is about social media and how
things appear before the camera and and,

54
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:14,170
and what's in it for me and I'm going to
be your friend because I'm going to get

55
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:15,004
something out of it.

56
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:19,660
When people look you and I put our life
on the line because of the conviction

57
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:24,640
that we have about the truth that we are
speaking and why we are willing to go

58
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:29,170
to great extent to just fight for
that truth. It resonates with people.

59
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,460
So I couldn't wait to be with you
today. This is great. Why do team,

60
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,590
did you always have this kind of passion?

61
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:41,490
I mean when you were on last time we told
or you told your your whole life story,

62
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:43,920
which is absolutely fascinating.
If you want to get me just like a,

63
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,370
a two minute recap and we'll link to it
down below so people can watch the whole

64
00:03:47,371 --> 00:03:49,740
thing if they have it. So you want
to give me a little recap on that,

65
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,600
but I also want to know where your bat,
that smile, that joy, that presence,

66
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,360
where does that come from within
you and did you always have that?

67
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,900
I love life and I am so passionate about
life is because I lived from the age of

68
00:04:05,581 --> 00:04:09,390
10 till the age of 20 waiting
to die every single day.

69
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,610
So every single day in my formula,

70
00:04:11,611 --> 00:04:16,590
two years when I opened my eyes
and I saw sunshine outside,

71
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,860
I didn't know if I'm going
to live to see the sunset.

72
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,540
So living in a bomb shelter,
you know, people ask me
where the special comes from.

73
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,720
My nine 11 happened to me in 1975 when
radical Islam is to blow up my home,

74
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,450
bringing it down, bring me
under the rubble, wounded.

75
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,950
I ended up in a hospital for two and a
half months and later when I came back

76
00:04:37,951 --> 00:04:40,740
home,
my home was no longer the home I left.

77
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,760
I ended up living in this bomb shelter,
eight by 10 room underground,

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,450
no electricity, no water,
and very little food.

79
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,400
And that's where I lived for seven
years of my life, robbed of my youth,

80
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:57,390
barely interacting with people,
barely interacting with people my age.

81
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,720
I lived with my parents who were an
elderly couple in that bomb shelter.

82
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,680
So all this, uh, uh, cooped up passion.

83
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,210
Now I tell people I'm making up
for lost time. So I love life.

84
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,980
I'm so grateful for life.
I'm so grateful for the people I meet,

85
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,610
the places I go. I never thought
I'd live the day beyond 20.

86
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,200
And then I never thought I'd live a day
beyond 30. And here I am, loving life.

87
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:27,060
I just turned 54 years old. I'm so proud
to make it secret somewhere. Thank you.

88
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:30,150
Thank you. When, when you have survived,

89
00:05:30,151 --> 00:05:32,130
as long as I have survived,

90
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,930
you brag about I made it to
this day, uh, at this age.

91
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:38,130
So this is why I love life.

92
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,890
So we're going to link to your,

93
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,070
our original sit down and your whole
story about growing up in Lebanon and all

94
00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:45,920
that so people can watch out
if they haven't seen it. Um,

95
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:50,780
but not everybody likes
you. And I remember before
I had you on the first time,

96
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,080
uh, you know, when people Google
you, and you even referenced this in,

97
00:05:54,081 --> 00:05:56,410
in that clip we are talking about,
you know, if you check your Wikipedia,

98
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,840
people say all sorts of awful things
about you and all this and I was a little

99
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:00,890
worried. I was like, ah.

100
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,760
It's like I'm going to have Bridgette
on and I'm going to get hate for it and

101
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:06,590
all that.
Now I'm really past that part of life.

102
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:10,190
Now I just want to do what I think is
right and I want to sit down with people

103
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:12,650
like you and have those conversations.
Um,

104
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,660
but are you shocked at the
kind of pushback you get
for defending the west and

105
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:19,190
defending Judeo Christian values?

106
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,590
I am no longer shocked. I
was in the beginning I was
very hurt, very disappointed.

107
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,230
I thought my message,

108
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,580
of course the west is going to resonate.
It's going to resonate in the west.

109
00:06:32,581 --> 00:06:36,720
People are going to appreciate why it's
important to fight for freedom of speech.

110
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,500
I was born and raised in Lebanon and a
country where if you stand up against the

111
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:43,980
status quo and you speak against
the regime, you are killed.

112
00:06:43,981 --> 00:06:46,560
They come take you in the middle of the
night, killed you, you'll disappear.

113
00:06:46,561 --> 00:06:48,570
You don't,
you'll never hear from you again.

114
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,180
I still have friends who
disappeared 30 years ago.

115
00:06:51,181 --> 00:06:53,340
Their parents don't even know
if they are alive or dead.

116
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,630
Journalists in my country of birth and
Lebanon get killed for writing the wrong

117
00:06:57,631 --> 00:07:01,890
thing. So when I came to the West and
when I started speaking in defense of our

118
00:07:01,891 --> 00:07:06,750
freedoms and our values and our way
of life, and the American values of,

119
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,400
of,
you know,

120
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,540
standing up for the truth and speaking
the truth without having to be worried

121
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:16,320
about somebody killing you,
I could not believe people will,

122
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:18,630
will come against me like that.
But you know what?

123
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,500
If you don't stand for something,
you know,

124
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,330
yeah,

125
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,400
you have to stand up for what you believe.

126
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,650
Those are the people
that make a difference.

127
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,440
And usually people that make a
difference in this world are not popular.

128
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,650
The most hated people in the look
at Churchill. I mean, you know,

129
00:07:34,651 --> 00:07:38,730
when he was alive, you know, people hated
him. They thought, oh my gosh, you know,

130
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,470
look at him today people,

131
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,800
people call people that have
spoken such words of wisdom.

132
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:47,610
But people laugh at them when they were
saying them. And so here we are today,

133
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:51,210
we stand up and we fight. And it
doesn't matter what people say about me,

134
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,770
I do what I believe is right because
I believe we are on a mission to save

135
00:07:55,771 --> 00:07:58,770
Western civilization,
which is under attack right now.

136
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,170
And I'm willing to do my
part to make it happen

137
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,280
is part of the problem of the West now
is that we don't have enough stories like

138
00:08:07,591 --> 00:08:11,430
yours because we've had it pretty good
in the West for the last, you know,

139
00:08:11,431 --> 00:08:14,460
50 some odd years. Certainly in the United
States. We've had it pretty good here.

140
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,670
So we've sort of gotten
fat and lazy on freedom.

141
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:19,020
We don't know what we're fighting for.

142
00:08:19,021 --> 00:08:22,560
We don't know what are the
generations before us lived through.

143
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,970
You lived through something.

144
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:27,150
So then you come here and then you see
all these people that are slowly eroding

145
00:08:27,151 --> 00:08:31,200
their freedoms and you're like, Whoa,
I know what this, where this leads

146
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,990
exactly.
My past is America's future.

147
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,450
Unless America wakes up today.
See,

148
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,020
I am the Anne Frank who
lived to tell about it.

149
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:46,170
Can you imagine if Anne Frank was alive
and the Nazis were spreading worldwide?

150
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:50,080
Then she just escaped the concentration
camps as you came to the United States

151
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,420
and Nazi-ism started rising
in the United States.

152
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,600
She would be saying the same words
that you when she was alive and with,

153
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,830
in my case, I started speaking after the
attacks on nine 11 on the United States.

154
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:05,250
I started speaking about the threat of
radical Islam to world peace and our

155
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:08,700
national security,
but because Americans had it so easy,

156
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:11,490
they cannot fathom that some
people could hate us so much.

157
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,700
Even though radical Islamic terrorists
hijacked airplanes and use them as a

158
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:21,480
human missiles, flying them into
skyscrapers with the intention of killing.

159
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,040
Not 3000 but maybe 50,000 that
worked in that building. You know,

160
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,870
if they were like only 15 minutes,

161
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,430
they would have killed tens
of thousands of Americans. Um,

162
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:35,670
and so this is what I was talking about,
but Americans are such good people.

163
00:09:35,671 --> 00:09:40,590
People in the west who have
never experienced the type
of terrorism that I lived

164
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:44,190
under cannot relate and think
that somebody could be that bad.

165
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,420
That actually that's the real intention
to kill as many people as possible.

166
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,390
How do you wake people up to that then?
Because it's a really hard,

167
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:54,510
because not everyone can have the
lived experience that you've had.

168
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,170
You don't have to wake all the people up.

169
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,840
You just have to wake
some of the people up.

170
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,500
You just have to wake up the passionate
I, you know, and my book rise,

171
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:06,480
I say 2% of the passion,

172
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,690
it's will always rule
the 98% in different,

173
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,880
it doesn't take many to change the world.

174
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,080
2% of the passionate will always
rule the 98% in different.

175
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,380
You just need to get people who
are fired up for your cause.

176
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,190
You need to get people who actually
understand the problem and get the problem

177
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:25,230
and want to do something
to change the world.

178
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,690
Those are the people that
you need to rally around you.

179
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,390
Those are the people who are gonna
make a difference in this world.

180
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,240
And those are the people that I,
that I tried to communicate with.

181
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,560
And because of that, I was able to
build an organization, act for America.

182
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,740
I'm proud to tell you that we are
now over 1 million members million.

183
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:47,430
It's incredible. We have chapters
nationwide. We have passed bills,

184
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,440
100 bills on the federal level as well
as the state level to protect America.

185
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,320
So when people tell me,
don't you worry about the names,

186
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,900
I mean people call you names,
you know, they, they, they, they,

187
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,900
they make you look bad.
They are on the list. VSL,

188
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:05,700
PC calls me and whites up promises.
How do you,

189
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:10,350
how do you like those white supremacists
lips and that white supremacists skin

190
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,480
and at this white supremacist hair.
Um,

191
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,100
but I tell people when
people slot playbills on you,

192
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:19,260
it's because they cannot
argue with your facts.

193
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,080
That's why the only thing they
can do is called you names.

194
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,400
They cannot debate you on the facts. And
you know, I tell people all the time,

195
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,880
don't worry about the labels and
don't worry about the haters,

196
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,180
the New York Times and my last book,
they must be stopped.

197
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,200
The book came out in September of 2008
that New York Times interviewed me and

198
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,930
they couldn't find one quote and
my article. So what did they do?

199
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:47,610
They titled the Article Radical
Islamophobia, not just an Islamophobe.

200
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,560
I am a radical Islamophobe.

201
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,490
Can you imagine if I would've let that
stop me because I was hurt that somebody

202
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:58,420
didn't like me and they could be a radical
Islamophobe instead of hiding under a

203
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:01,900
table, you know, trying to
kind of a pat my emotions.

204
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:07,170
I went there and continue doing exactly
what I do best since 2008 till today,

205
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,410
my organization has helped best 100 bills.

206
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:15,850
And that's why I tell people don't let
the naysayers and also slap labels on you.

207
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:17,560
Stop you.
Keep on moving forward.

208
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,490
What do you make of these
leftist organizations,

209
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:24,570
whether it's SPLC or the
Adl or now in the media,

210
00:12:24,571 --> 00:12:29,571
the New York Times that are actually
empowering the very ideologies that would

211
00:12:30,331 --> 00:12:33,420
love to take away all of their
freedoms. I mean this way, I mean it's,

212
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:34,260
you've got this Sorta,

213
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,610
you've got the progressive's basically
in bed with the Islamist and to me it's

214
00:12:38,611 --> 00:12:41,940
like they're just sort of willful
idiots or there's probably some other

215
00:12:41,941 --> 00:12:42,774
pejorative.
Okay.

216
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,880
Exactly. You know, and my book cries,

217
00:12:44,881 --> 00:12:48,720
I have a whole chapter titled The
leftest Islam Is Coalition. Yeah.

218
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,900
Because that's exactly what we are
seeing right now coming together.

219
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:53,790
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

220
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,710
So we are seeing two people that do
not agree with anything that we say,

221
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,230
do not believe in
America's exceptionalism.

222
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,900
Do not believe that America
should have strong borders.

223
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,500
Do not believe that we know that we need
to have a national identity. We need,

224
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,120
I mean securing our border,

225
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,970
meaning securing and protecting
our national identity.

226
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,610
They do not believe in borders.
They do not believe in language.

227
00:13:14,611 --> 00:13:17,460
They want to bring America down to the,
on part of the rest of the world.

228
00:13:17,461 --> 00:13:20,820
You know, America is equal with Ben as
well. No one is better than anybody.

229
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,590
All societies are created equal.

230
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,860
You are I that even though people
are created equal in the eyes of God,

231
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,510
societies are not created equal.

232
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:35,700
And so we are seeing right now is leftist
organizations working with the Islam

233
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:39,690
is, so you've got organizations like the
ACL, Ooh, the southern poverty law center.

234
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,570
Planned parenthood,
uh,

235
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,640
move on that or Gordon with people like
Linda Sarsour who is a devout Islamist,

236
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,220
a proponent of Sharia law,
um,

237
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,640
and working with people like her or
with care coastal and American Islamic

238
00:13:53,641 --> 00:13:57,750
relations. The ACL you is
basically the legal arm of care,

239
00:13:57,751 --> 00:13:59,370
the council on American Islamic Relations.

240
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,930
So do you think they realize
what's going on here?

241
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:04,030
This is the part that I'm always sort of,

242
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,700
cause I don't like impugning
people's motives. Right.

243
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,880
So it's like do they realize that they're
working with people who once they have

244
00:14:12,161 --> 00:14:14,520
the power will gladly cut them out?

245
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,560
No, they don't. They just
don't. They don't because
people that work for the ACL,

246
00:14:19,561 --> 00:14:20,340
Ooh,

247
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:25,340
people that work for a different
leftist organizations have good hearts.

248
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,930
They love America,

249
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,700
and they cannot believe that people could
be bad or people couldn't use them for

250
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:34,560
their end goal.
You know,

251
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:37,410
when I talk about the Muslim Brotherhood
project and you and I have talked about

252
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:39,910
the Muslim Brotherhood project
in our previous interview,

253
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,120
people need to go watch that interview
with me. Everybody watching us right now,

254
00:14:45,121 --> 00:14:48,090
they need to go back and watch
that previous interview. Um,

255
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:52,490
the Muslim Brotherhood wrote a plan at
100 year plan radical Islam to infiltrate

256
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:56,090
and dominate the West and establish
an Islamic government on earth.

257
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,200
What makes the plan so unique,
especially the plan for the United States,

258
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:04,100
for the destruction of America?
The last page of the plan for America,

259
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,280
let's 29 front Islamic organizations
set up in the United States with the

260
00:15:09,471 --> 00:15:13,040
specific purpose of sabotaging
America and destroying it from within.

261
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,890
Many of these organizations
that I mentioned, Isna,

262
00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:18,360
Islamic Society of North America,
uh,

263
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,900
the MSA Muslim students association care,

264
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:26,080
which started as I AAP Islamic Association
for Palestine later became care

265
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,870
because they wanted to create another
name because the FBI was on their tail

266
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:32,750
knowing that they are a Hamas
front in the United States.

267
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,640
Those are the names mentioned.

268
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:39,410
So what we're seeing right now is
people like the Hclu move on that or the

269
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:44,150
southern poverty law center are basically
used as the useful idiots at the hands

270
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,590
of what Islam is with an agenda.

271
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,920
So while I am very upset at how the Adl
or the SPLC or the ACL EU is taking the

272
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:58,280
side of Islam,
is that against people like me?

273
00:15:58,281 --> 00:16:02,710
I'm not sure what they say about you,
but I know they hate my guts. I, yeah.

274
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,600
And so I see that and it's,

275
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:10,630
it's sad to realize that their good
intentions are being used to do something

276
00:16:11,961 --> 00:16:15,860
bad at the end, but they don't
realize it at this point. Meanwhile,

277
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:20,000
they're working with the Islam is
against people like me who basically are

278
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:23,360
trying to warn against the same people
who are going to destroy them at the end.

279
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,200
And that's why I framed it

280
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,050
the question that way cause I don't
like attacking people's motives.

281
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:30,680
And I believe that if we were to sit down
with all of the people at the ACL you,

282
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:33,490
that the vast majority of them are,

283
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:37,220
are totally doing all of these things
for what they believe to be the the right

284
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:38,180
reason,
the right reason.

285
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:42,650
Yet they've been just sort of tricked
into having some really unholy alliance.

286
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,960
Look, the southern poverty law
center, uh, the same thing.

287
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,890
They started as a good organization
fighting the Klu Klux Klan doing something

288
00:16:49,891 --> 00:16:53,370
good that was a result
that they raised money,

289
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,780
they fought the Klu
Klux Klan and look the,

290
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,700
the Klu Klux Klan deserves to be in a
whole because we in America will never

291
00:16:59,701 --> 00:17:02,340
ever tolerate such true hatred.

292
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:07,970
But for them right now to slap the label
hate on anybody who speaks the truth or

293
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:13,530
do not agree with their point of view.
They don't know what my heart is. I see.

294
00:17:13,531 --> 00:17:16,830
I never judge anybody's heart. I
am the same way. You never know.

295
00:17:16,831 --> 00:17:20,790
People would ask me about,
uh, Barack Obama. Do you
think he's a Muslim? You know,

296
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:24,060
I cannot judge anybody's heart.
I don't know who he prays for.

297
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:27,180
I didn't know what's between
him and he's God, he's God.

298
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,490
That's what he does in the
privacy of his own home.

299
00:17:29,491 --> 00:17:32,730
And I will never judge where he stands.
And a lot of people on the right,

300
00:17:32,731 --> 00:17:36,240
they didn't even like me saying
those words. But that's the truth.

301
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:39,660
I will never judge what's in somebody's
heart or what's in somebody's mind.

302
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,340
I judged them by their actions. So
now when people slap labels on me, oh,

303
00:17:44,341 --> 00:17:46,950
she's a hater.
You don't even know me.

304
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,410
You have never even sat
down with me and talked me.

305
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:53,130
How can you start the label and emotional
label on somebody that you don't even

306
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:53,410
know

307
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:56,920
if you're a hater? You're seriously
much better actress than hater.

308
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,480
Because you got me for lady

309
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,380
I, I'm telling you. I mean, you know,

310
00:18:00,381 --> 00:18:05,381
it is so sad to see that coming from them
and they're not listening to whatever

311
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:09,500
explanation or even when we reach out
to them, they don't want to talk to us.

312
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:10,760
They don't want to hear our side of the,

313
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:15,170
of the view is like they judged
us in absentia and that is it.

314
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,260
You know, the, speaking of
judging and [inaudible],

315
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:20,210
they are no better than the
terrorist in Lebanon. You know,

316
00:18:20,211 --> 00:18:24,200
I went to Israel this year and
a visit with my parents' grave.

317
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:27,650
I didn't know if you know my parents, I
bird with Oskar Schindler and Mount Zion.

318
00:18:27,651 --> 00:18:29,670
Yeah.
And so this was the first time.

319
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,080
Tell people how you ended up in
Israel after leaving Lebanon.

320
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,900
Well, I left Lebanon. I
ended up moving to Israel,

321
00:18:35,901 --> 00:18:38,840
becoming a news anchor for world
news and working in Jerusalem.

322
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,180
And when my parents died,

323
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:46,630
I wanted to make sure that I buried them
in Israel because I wanted to make sure

324
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:50,930
that my children yet unborn will
always know where my loyalty lies.

325
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:55,910
And because I'm a firm believer that
actions speak louder than words.

326
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:01,670
So I wanted to make sure I honor my
parents because I adore my parents said,

327
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:06,380
this is a very sensitive subject
with me. Uh, I'm an only child.

328
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,000
I worship my parents.

329
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,320
I live every single day of my life doing
everything I do to honor them and their

330
00:19:12,321 --> 00:19:15,320
legacy. And you know, speaking of hatred,

331
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,940
some former employer did me
wrong when I was 22 years old.

332
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:24,230
And I remember sitting on my father's
lap and he's wheelchair hugging him.

333
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:26,510
I was crying and I said,
Oh Daddy, I just hate them.

334
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:30,890
I get believe they did this to us. And
my father said to me, he said, I never,

335
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:35,210
ever want to hear that word coming out of
your mouth. I never raised you to hate.

336
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,060
And if for nothing else,

337
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,920
because of the way I adore
my father at that day,

338
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,640
at 22 years old,
I vowed I will never hate somebody.

339
00:19:46,641 --> 00:19:49,670
My father died like two weeks later.
I will never,

340
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:52,940
ever allow hate to enter my heart
towards my enemies, towards anybody.

341
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:57,630
I don't hate anybody. So when my
parents died, I buried them in, in,

342
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,590
in Jerusalem. They are buried
with Oscar Schindler, Mount Zion.

343
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,740
We're actually later he was
brought in and buried next to them.

344
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,580
So this year I went back
to Lebanon to Israel.

345
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:12,230
And because I cannot go to
Lebanon, Hezbollah wants
me dead. So I go to Israel,

346
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,690
I visit Israel,
I meet with the IDF.

347
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,720
I actually was the first Lebanese person
to ever make it to the rooftop of the

348
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:22,020
idea of headquarters in Tel Aviv.

349
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:26,030
And I recorded videos with
the spokesperson of the IDF
and with the top generals.

350
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,640
We recorded videos to be
broadcast to the United Nations,

351
00:20:28,641 --> 00:20:32,810
to the international community video
to be broadcast to Lebanon about how,

352
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:36,770
why we need to work together towards
peace, why we need to love each other.

353
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,830
Put Peyto side,
forget what you're told about the Jews.

354
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,470
Israel doesn't want anything
but peace with its neighbors.

355
00:20:42,471 --> 00:20:43,670
Let's work together on peace.

356
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,460
And for that Hezbollah air
that on Lebanese television,

357
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,920
they charged me with treason.

358
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:56,130
Now I am wanted that in Lebanon and
sentenced to death by hanging and obsess

359
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:57,334
[inaudible].

360
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,380
So here we have a group of terrorists
and my home country of Lebanon who judged

361
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,560
me and who I am and I deserve to be good
sentence to death by hanging because

362
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:11,710
they did not agree with me preaching a
message of love about being friends with

363
00:21:11,711 --> 00:21:15,490
the Jews. So here we have
them calling me haters. Yeah.

364
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,380
And yet I have the loftiest in America,

365
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:20,890
the southern poverty law center and
these people calling me haters simply

366
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:23,320
because I'm mourning about
the Islamic terrorist threat.

367
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,760
All right, well you've got too much
good in you to focus on the haters.

368
00:21:25,761 --> 00:21:28,190
But I do have one other question about
the haters and then we're going to just

369
00:21:28,191 --> 00:21:29,001
put it behind us,

370
00:21:29,001 --> 00:21:33,290
which is when Majid Nawaz
sued the southern poverty
law center and now he's been

371
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,500
removed from their anti
Muslim extremist list.

372
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:40,880
And you were on there still as far as
I know. Uh, I is I on still on there

373
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,740
actually that let, yeah, I honest to
La over the enemy and I on of course.

374
00:21:45,741 --> 00:21:49,620
Are you kidding? Um, no.
Linda Sarsour once your,

375
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,190
once my private parts removed. Yeah.
Miss Women's feminist movement. You know,

376
00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:00,260
um, but that the world is turned upside
down so we are still on that list,

377
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,123
um,

378
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,480
sit or a lawsuit or anything because
I'm not generally for lawsuits in these

379
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:06,314
cases.

380
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,440
But magic proved that if they've really
wronged you and you can get the backing

381
00:22:12,351 --> 00:22:16,280
to get the lawyers to do it,
that ultimately justice does prevail.

382
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:22,070
We talk to our attorneys to sue them and
it's going to cost a lot of money and

383
00:22:23,251 --> 00:22:25,230
they can drag it for
years and years and years,

384
00:22:25,231 --> 00:22:28,620
I've gotten onto at 90 attorneys on
staff while we have to depend on the

385
00:22:28,621 --> 00:22:32,070
generosity of attorneys to do with pro
bono. Yeah. They get drag it forever.

386
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,660
Plus because I'm a public person and the
head of an organization that will get

387
00:22:36,661 --> 00:22:38,040
us into discovery,

388
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,240
which means they not
only can't subpoena me,

389
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,340
which I don't say anything bad,
I'm not worried,

390
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,570
but they can go after my chapters and
any communications our chapters have done

391
00:22:48,571 --> 00:22:52,620
with their friends. Now our
chapters are completely independent.

392
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,100
They're members are
completely independent. I
don't even know who they are.

393
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:01,170
So if somebody sent a personal email to
a third party mentioning any word about

394
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:04,890
hate, which we are completely
not responsible for because
they don't speak about

395
00:23:04,891 --> 00:23:08,130
headquarters, they can say, see we
told you they've got people that Tate.

396
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,940
And so because I do not know three,
four levels down.

397
00:23:11,941 --> 00:23:16,290
See now she doesn't have
a national organization.

398
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,900
Definitely not with chapters
and members the way we do.

399
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,580
So he's only responsible for what t says.
I can fight and defend what I say,

400
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,990
but I cannot fight and defend what
people die. I don't even know. Look,

401
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:31,110
the SPLC went after us and they said,
oh, we've got white supremacists.

402
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,650
You know who show up to our rallies
we haven't drawn is on the side street

403
00:23:34,651 --> 00:23:38,620
corner. Yeah. Anybody can stand on
the side street corner. You know,

404
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,300
you cannot say that these members belong
to my organization. Yeah, but they do.

405
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,040
And that's the tactic
of the left right now.

406
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,100
All right,
let's focus on

407
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,871
the book.
So the,

408
00:23:46,871 --> 00:23:50,570
the subtitle is in defense of
Judeo Christian values and freedom.

409
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:56,330
So just most simply, if someone said to
you, what our Judeo Christian values,

410
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,550
what are they? What are,
where do the most fundamental,

411
00:23:58,551 --> 00:24:01,270
Judeo Christian values
that we need? No. Well,

412
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:06,640
do they have Christian values are
the bedrock of Western civilization.

413
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:11,110
They are the foundation of
what we have today in America.

414
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:15,880
And this is not a religious
book at all. Yeah, you read it,

415
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,890
you endorsed it. Yeah. It's not a
religious book. A little bit more there.

416
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,150
You got a little blurb in there.
One of the most fundamental freedoms.

417
00:24:22,151 --> 00:24:24,250
I'll give you a perfect example.
Freedom of speech.

418
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:28,420
People don't realize where that freedom
comes from. You know, and Israel,

419
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:33,130
the Hasidic Jews, they debate
the Bible. They 24 hours a day.

420
00:24:33,131 --> 00:24:36,640
That's all they do. They debate the
Bible. And what does that come from?

421
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,810
The Bible says, come let's reason
together means let's debate ideas.

422
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,310
I may not like your idea.

423
00:24:42,311 --> 00:24:46,030
You may not like mine and we can have
five other people who might look at the

424
00:24:46,031 --> 00:24:47,920
same verse completely differently.

425
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:53,160
But the reason why we debate ideas is
because we can learn from each other and

426
00:24:53,351 --> 00:24:56,290
better understand what statements mean.

427
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,530
Where'd the author who wrote
that statement meant by it?

428
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:02,710
We all know that God didn't write
the Bible. People wrote the Bible.

429
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:07,420
So part of our fundamental way of
thinking, the freedom of speech,

430
00:25:07,421 --> 00:25:11,320
the ability to come together and debate
ideas and passionately debated these

431
00:25:11,321 --> 00:25:15,580
ideas yet agree to respectfully
disagree and walk away.

432
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,320
People don't realize that comes
from the foundation of today.

433
00:25:19,321 --> 00:25:21,940
A Christian Foundation.
You know,

434
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:26,770
even people who are not religious
understand that. So uniquely Western,

435
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:31,150
you know, they don't do that. And, and,
and, and the Islamic world for example,

436
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:34,900
you don't debate ideas.
Why? Because in the Qur'an,

437
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,440
the Qur'an was written, it's the
word of God. It's not debatable.

438
00:25:38,441 --> 00:25:41,310
It's not negotiable. You can not
look back. You can add change versus,

439
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,210
and you don't even talk about it.

440
00:25:43,211 --> 00:25:46,240
You can even question it very
different than the way we are.

441
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:51,160
So when I write in the book about, and
I actually, I have a chapter titled, uh,

442
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:56,220
the death of free speech where I talk
about how we are losing our ability to

443
00:25:56,411 --> 00:26:00,160
speak the truth because then you're
labeled your biggest people are afraid.

444
00:26:00,161 --> 00:26:02,740
Am I going to be, you know,
black man? Am I going to be card?

445
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:06,080
Am I gonna lose my job? Um, and so it's,

446
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:10,360
we're silencing ourselves and
that's why I titled the Book Rise,

447
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,370
Rise in defense of today are Christian
values and freedom because we're losing

448
00:26:15,371 --> 00:26:18,730
those freedoms, those American
values before our very eyes.

449
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:22,620
Are you watching this chip away more in
Europe than in the United States right

450
00:26:22,621 --> 00:26:24,030
now for all our problems around this,

451
00:26:24,031 --> 00:26:27,060
and I agree at the bigger problem right
now is that we're silencing ourselves

452
00:26:27,061 --> 00:26:29,130
rather than the government
coming to silence us.

453
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:31,950
Although that could potentially be a
problem in the future, I don't sense.

454
00:26:31,951 --> 00:26:33,150
It's a huge problem right now.

455
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,600
Europe has a whole other set
of problems around free speech.

456
00:26:36,601 --> 00:26:41,601
Do you think that they're more suited
to lose faster because they don't have a

457
00:26:41,731 --> 00:26:42,930
first amendment the way we do?

458
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,100
Oh yeah,
there are far

459
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,190
more advanced than losing their
rights and their freedoms than we are.

460
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,370
And they did it by self censorship.
You know, I landed in London,

461
00:26:50,371 --> 00:26:54,810
I was speaking in London in 2007,
so I land in London.

462
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:59,430
I'm a standing there waiting
for my luggage with the um, uh,

463
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,940
pilot and the hostesses,
uh,

464
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,940
we were in a private section and they
said, oh, what are you doing here?

465
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:07,500
And I said, Oh, I'm just
here for like three days.

466
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:10,570
I'm giving a speech in parliament.
I was speaking to the, uh,

467
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,380
British parliament and they said, oh,
what are you going to be talking about?

468
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:17,910
And I said, the threat of radical Islam
to world peace and national security. Oh.

469
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,260
And all of a sudden silence for 30
seconds. You could hear a pin drop.

470
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:27,320
They didn't know how to react or what to
say. They were so afraid to react less.

471
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:30,060
Somebody hears something.
The taxi driver,

472
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,960
my driver picked me up to drive me to
my hotel and we were talking in the car

473
00:27:33,961 --> 00:27:36,120
and I told them, you asked me
again, what are you doing here?

474
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:40,260
And I said the same thing. He
said, Bridgette, in 10 years,

475
00:27:40,261 --> 00:27:44,190
I believe we're going to have blood
on the streets of London by radical

476
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:45,024
Islamists.

477
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:49,410
We are at war and it
didn't even take 10 years.

478
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,120
Within five years,

479
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,500
we already started seeing stabbing on the
streets of London and stuff like that.

480
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:59,700
So in Europe they are afraid to talk
about it and they do not have the freedom

481
00:27:59,701 --> 00:28:00,600
of speech that we have.

482
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:04,560
And that's why it is so important to
defend the freedom of speech that we have.

483
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,290
And God bless them, our founding
fathers would, their wisdom,

484
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:09,260
they knew exactly what they
were doing. I mean, look,

485
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,770
remember they came from Europe.

486
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,400
So when they wrote us what they gave us
the constitution and our bill of rights

487
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,300
and all of that stuff,

488
00:28:15,301 --> 00:28:18,900
they knew exactly why they put
some of these amendments are there.

489
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:24,430
So all right, so let's just put a Europe
aside. Since we're in the United States,

490
00:28:24,431 --> 00:28:27,850
they're going to have to deal with
that. We'll deal with it here. Um, okay,

491
00:28:27,851 --> 00:28:29,290
we can get people to rise.

492
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:33,610
But what else do we have to do to have
a discussion about this that's going to

493
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:36,010
stop the people that are going
to use all of those labels.

494
00:28:36,011 --> 00:28:38,320
So I know even in the book
you make a point of saying,

495
00:28:38,321 --> 00:28:42,940
of course this is not all Muslims
and don't be bigoted towards Muslim.

496
00:28:42,941 --> 00:28:45,220
People were talking about an ideology.

497
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,130
A lot of people have been doing
that for the last couple of years.

498
00:28:48,131 --> 00:28:51,550
Tried to separate people from ideas and
all that and still get all the labels

499
00:28:51,551 --> 00:28:52,360
thrown at them.

500
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,950
What are some of the other techniques we
can use to talk about these things and

501
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,270
not be crushed by,
by all the Labor?

502
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:03,240
Don't waste your breath because there
is nothing you can say at this point.

503
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,980
No matter what you say, the
enemy, the SPLC, the Adl,

504
00:29:07,981 --> 00:29:12,090
move on that or organizing for action.
All the progressive organizations,

505
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:16,290
they're not willing to listen to you.
They don't want to listen to you. Look,

506
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,070
we organized march against sharia,
March for human rights last year,

507
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:22,150
a year and a half ago.
Uh,

508
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:27,170
and we had rallies in 29 cities in 21
states and we timed it with the pulse

509
00:29:27,571 --> 00:29:31,260
nightclub bombing and Florida
because it was June 10th,

510
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,440
we wanted to shine a light about the
hatred of this ideology against gays,

511
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,160
what they do to gays.
I mean,

512
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,520
look at the pulse nightclub bombing that
the people that organize our rallies in

513
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:45,850
New York. It was organized
in, headed by two gay guys.

514
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,700
The rally in Atlanta was
headed by a Muslim man.

515
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:52,890
Do we had an imam mom speaking in Seattle.
We had Miriam Ibrahim this.

516
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,950
So then he survivors speak up our rally
in Virginia Beach as well as an Iranian

517
00:29:56,951 --> 00:29:59,680
Muslim leader of the Iranian movement,
you know,

518
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:01,660
to to to two away from the molars.
Yeah.

519
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,360
Did you think any of the
media covered any of that?

520
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:07,870
All they did is show up on the street
corners. I know. Hey, it's say no to hate.

521
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,890
Say not the, hey, they didn't even bother.
Yeah. Understand what we were doing.

522
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,400
So don't waste your breath right now.
People tell me,

523
00:30:15,401 --> 00:30:16,870
why are you speaking to the choir,
Bridget?

524
00:30:16,871 --> 00:30:19,750
We need to talk to other
people at this time.

525
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,610
You need to mobilize the choir because
when you need your house cleaned,

526
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,940
it is the choir that shows up.
It is the choir that brings you food.

527
00:30:27,941 --> 00:30:28,710
When you're sick,

528
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:32,380
it is the choir that maps the church
or the temple when it needs cleaning.

529
00:30:32,381 --> 00:30:36,340
It's the choir that brings the flowers
and that's all that matters to keep your

530
00:30:36,341 --> 00:30:40,270
house up and keep it protected
and that's why right now,

531
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,820
don't waste your breath on the labels.
Make sure you fight.

532
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:44,590
Make sure you lobby
your elected officials.

533
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,440
Make sure you understand
the power of the gavel,

534
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:50,950
why it is important to call your
elected officials. You know in my book,

535
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,070
what makes this book so unique
is that the end of every chapter,

536
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:59,050
I have a section titled Dries Up
and act where I give people ideas.

537
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,970
So I want to do all that at the end.
I want all,

538
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,970
I want all of your absolute advice
on this, but what are you hit on?

539
00:31:03,971 --> 00:31:05,200
Something that I think is
really interesting there.

540
00:31:05,201 --> 00:31:09,970
How there's a connection to all of this
and the way the media reports. Yeah,

541
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,790
you're right. That when they cover
your events or when they cover,

542
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:16,060
a lot of the people that I'm friends
with that I have on the show,

543
00:31:16,061 --> 00:31:19,780
whatever they say,
it's like they only focus on the haters.

544
00:31:19,781 --> 00:31:23,500
They only focus on that.
The one little outsider that's,

545
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,830
that's doing something that's
bad and not on all the good. How,

546
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,830
how do you think this happened to the
media or is there a way that it can be

547
00:31:29,831 --> 00:31:32,140
fixed or does it need to
burn to the ground or what?

548
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:36,810
Because the progressive media
is not interested in dialogue.

549
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,350
They are interested in winning.
See,

550
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,160
we on the conservative side,
you know, and it's such a shame.

551
00:31:44,161 --> 00:31:46,710
I never thought of myself
as opposed to serve. I mean,

552
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:50,520
I don't know if I told I voted for
Al Gore, I was a proud democrat.

553
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,030
I'm a nine 11, you know, conservative
as they call us conservative. Uh,

554
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,090
but this is where we are
and our nation right now,

555
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,380
they consider people like you conservative
because you speak about, you know,

556
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,890
important issues that are now known as,
oh,

557
00:32:04,891 --> 00:32:07,220
that's what the conservatives
talk about. Yeah. You know,

558
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,370
so what we are seeing right now is
the media is interested in winning.

559
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,880
While we are interested in having good
dialogue, how can we get through to them?

560
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,950
How can we speak with them,
you know,

561
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,260
and find the bridge where we
can talk to them about that.

562
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,940
They're not interested in talking to us.

563
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,940
They're interesting in
silencing our voices.

564
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:27,930
And the sooner we know that the better
we are in fighting our battle and

565
00:32:27,931 --> 00:32:32,440
learning how to win our battle. And
you add to that, funders like sorrows,

566
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,151
you know,
and my book,

567
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:38,151
I have a whole section about sorrows and
him funding the media source right now

568
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,173
has spent

569
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:42,560
do an anti Semite. If you talk
about Soros, that's their new meme.

570
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:46,370
I didn't even know he was
Jewish until about a year ago.

571
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,330
[inaudible] he does is
usually against Israel.

572
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:55,710
Exactly. The height of stupidity.
Yeah. Uh, I mean, you know,

573
00:32:55,930 --> 00:33:00,030
you would think, keep sounds on talks like
an antisemite much more than me. Right?

574
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:04,210
Remember, he is the one who works with the
doctors, with the Nazis on, on, on, um,

575
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,370
and actually had a smile
when people ask them,

576
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:09,430
how did you feel about going in and
working with the Nazis against your own

577
00:33:09,431 --> 00:33:12,070
people? He said, well, you
know, somebody had to do it.

578
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,880
So I know I got say any problem with it,
you know? Yeah. You're not making that up,

579
00:33:15,881 --> 00:33:17,170
by the way. No, no. I mean,

580
00:33:17,171 --> 00:33:21,370
I watched these interview because I was
very interested on what makes this man

581
00:33:21,371 --> 00:33:23,860
the way he is. I studied my enemies. Uh,

582
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,500
I spend a lot of hours actually
studying my enemies, uh,

583
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:30,910
to understand how they think,
why, why do they behave, you know,

584
00:33:30,911 --> 00:33:34,330
trying to pick up on cues.
So you look at somebody like George Soros,

585
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:39,250
who is interested in transforming
America into his vision of how the world

586
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:42,550
should be, and he has the billions
and he's willing to spend that.

587
00:33:42,551 --> 00:33:45,310
43 billion has already
been spent on the media,

588
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:49,870
on Soros funded media
entities from, uh, since 2002.

589
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,780
And so when you look today at SARS,

590
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,790
has tentacles extend to a 33
media outlets including ABC, NBC,

591
00:33:57,791 --> 00:34:01,210
CBS, MSNBC, the Washington
Post, the Associated Press,

592
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:05,380
which I detail in my book. Uh, even
though the, to give you an example,

593
00:34:05,381 --> 00:34:06,370
which I talked in the book,
uh,

594
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:11,490
Columbia School of journalism gave them
$600,000 to their journalism school

595
00:34:11,711 --> 00:34:16,510
because he wanted to impact the reporting
on how reporters report on the media

596
00:34:16,511 --> 00:34:20,620
issues in the future. So nobody
was paying attention to this stuff.

597
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,970
But this is exactly how we ended up with
reporters who are no longer reporters.

598
00:34:24,971 --> 00:34:29,971
They are activists with
a national platform media
platform who get on television

599
00:34:30,281 --> 00:34:35,110
every night and basically spew the same
talking political points approved by

600
00:34:35,111 --> 00:34:38,290
sorrows. And they all say the same
thing, whether it's the Huffington Post,

601
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:42,880
the New York Times, the Associated
Press, Reuters, MSNBC, CNBC,

602
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:46,300
ABC, the same buzzword.
And it's all coordinated.

603
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,000
How concerned are you that on the social
media front where people like you who

604
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:51,510
have been able to make gains,
you know,

605
00:34:51,511 --> 00:34:53,220
I'll see every now and
again you'll talk about, oh,

606
00:34:53,221 --> 00:34:56,550
I just suddenly lost 5,000 followers
on Twitter or something like that,

607
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:00,060
that we're fighting a
losing battle on that front.

608
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,270
Ultimately because these companies a,

609
00:35:03,271 --> 00:35:06,330
I think there are a lot of political
connections and who knows what's going on

610
00:35:06,331 --> 00:35:09,940
behind the scenes, but B,
they've basically embraced the,

611
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
the leftist ideology and they're not
really around to make sure that Bridgette

612
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,163
Gabriel's voice can be heard.

613
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:21,430
Well, we lose followers by the tens
of thousands, tens of thousands. Uh,

614
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,700
and we are seeing that happen
especially now at a dramatic pace. Uh,

615
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,470
but you continue on doing
what you are doing it,

616
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,060
there's nothing you can do to change
it. Uh, you just continue pushing.

617
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,750
We are working with members of Congress
to make sure that there's fairness and

618
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:40,500
reporting and that the government will
intervene to make sure that we don't have

619
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:42,900
a monopoly. Look, they did
the same thing with Microsoft.

620
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:46,410
Remember Microsoft had a
monopoly. The government had
to intervene. And they said,

621
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:49,680
no, you cannot stop anybody else
who wants to develop computers.

622
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:53,040
Apple didn't have a chance
of, the government didn't
intervene with Microsoft.

623
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,180
So we know that there is precedent,
but here's the secrets to success.

624
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,980
My Libertarian brain,

625
00:35:58,981 --> 00:36:01,950
all the bells go off on that stuff though
because I don't want the government to

626
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,920
do it.
It's like for me it's like be last resort.

627
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:08,430
Even though I know that this is obviously
a very personal issue to me as someone

628
00:36:08,431 --> 00:36:10,080
that puts this up on
youtube and the rest of it,

629
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,920
we want that fairness.
We're not telling them silence anybody,

630
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,420
but we are saying to them, allow
people to speak their mind. You know,

631
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:22,830
if I own a media platform and I do not
agree with you at all in what you say,

632
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,900
as an American,

633
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:30,230
I will bite my tongue and grit my
teeth and listen to what I absolutely

634
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:32,800
passionately opposed. I'm not
saying you, but anybody you know.

635
00:36:32,801 --> 00:36:35,220
You could be saying,
you know what, whoever,

636
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,890
but I will fight for
your right to do with,

637
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,270
I will not silence you because
it is an American to silence you.

638
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,010
So as Americans,

639
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:47,970
we owe it to each other at least
to defend these rights so we can,

640
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:53,220
so we can pass them out to our future
generations. You never really own freedom,

641
00:36:53,221 --> 00:36:56,100
David. We only preserve it
for the future generation.

642
00:36:56,101 --> 00:36:57,840
And I said that statement with you before,

643
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,990
and I actually have it going
all throughout my book.

644
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:05,280
These are the rights that our
founding fathers gave everything,

645
00:37:05,281 --> 00:37:08,790
and most of them died broke to give
us these rights that we have today.

646
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,430
The least we can do is preserve
it for the next generation.

647
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,760
That's all we're asking for.
But you know the secret to success,

648
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,060
regardless of how much the,

649
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,270
the social media puts you on Facebook
jail or Twitter bands, your shadow banned,

650
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,840
et Cetera, tenacity, tenacity,
tenacity. You keep on pushing,

651
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:29,820
you keep on pushing. You keep on pushing
and you never, ever, ever give up.

652
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:31,740
That is the secret to success.
