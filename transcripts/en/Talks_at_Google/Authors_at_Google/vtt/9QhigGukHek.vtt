[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:08.520
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.166
MALIK DUCARD: Give
it up for Ken.

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.100
All right.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.960
Thanks so much, Ken.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.846
All right.

00:00:15.846 --> 00:00:20.770
I Am so excited to be
here with our guest today.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.770
So my name is Malik Ducard.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.870
And I head up the global family
and learning team for YouTube.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.300
And it's my great
honor and pleasure

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.260
to introduce the man,
the legend, Bill Nye.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.870
So let's--

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.557
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
--give a round of applause.

00:00:38.557 --> 00:00:43.080
[LAUGHS] Now, we've
got around an hour.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.980
And I could probably spend the
whole hour introducing you.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.050
But I'll spend the
whole hour doing that.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.780
No, I'll kick off with
a little bit of intro.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.390
So Bill Nye has been the
public face of science

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.150
for more than 20 years.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.660
In his latest book, that
we'll talk a lot about today,

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.640
"Everything All At Once--

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.960
How to Unleash Your Inner Nerd,
Tap Into Radical Curiosity,

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.480
and Solve Any Problem,"
from Rodale Books,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.250
Nye issues a call to
arms meant to encourage

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.950
readers to really
become the change they

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.240
want to see in the world.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.730
Whether addressing global
warming, social change,

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.250
or personal success, there
are certain strategies

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.410
that always get results--

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.260
looking at the world
with radical curiosity,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.690
being driven by a desire
for a better future,

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.730
and being willing
to take the actions

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.790
needed to make change a reality.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.720
Best known as the host of Emmy
award-winning PBS Discovery

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.580
Channel show, "Bill
Nye, the Science Guy"--

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.538
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:47.610
--give it up for that--

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.300
and the current host of
Netflix show "Bill Nye Saves

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.360
the World-- give
it up for that--

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.350
Bill is a science educator,
mechanical engineer, and New

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.880
York Times best-selling author.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.300
He's also the CEO of
the Planetary Society,

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.840
that we'll talk about, and holds
a BS in mechanical engineering

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.284
from Cornell, and has
several doctorate degrees.

00:02:09.284 --> 00:02:12.480
So let's give a warm
introduction of welcome

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.780
to Bill Nye.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.676
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:15.800
BILL NYE: Thank you, Malik.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.770
Thank you.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.585
Is there any time left?

00:02:18.585 --> 00:02:19.710
MALIK DUCARD: That's right.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.210
That's right.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.020
So I had the opportunity to
read your book, "Everything

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.244
All At Once," and loved it.

00:02:27.244 --> 00:02:28.410
BILL NYE: I appreciate that.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.210
You know, a lot of times,
you get interviewed,

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.505
and they haven't read the book.

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:32.500
So that's nice.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.000
Thank you.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.650
MALIK DUCARD: I have
read it, cover to cover.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.540
BILL NYE: And these are your
people here, it looks like.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.748
MALIK DUCARD: These are my
people, my kids, and wife.

00:02:38.748 --> 00:02:40.337
BILL NYE: They're
not in school today.

00:02:40.337 --> 00:02:41.291
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:43.596
Well, it's July, I guess.

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:44.970
MALIK DUCARD: So
can you tell us,

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.970
what does everything
all at once mean?

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.760
BILL NYE: So we have a great
many problems facing humankind.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.540
We have-- oh, when I
was in grade school,

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.330
there were three billion
people in the world.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.730
Now there are
almost 7.4 billion.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.010
By 2050, there
certainly will be 9,

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.792
but there may be
10 billion people.

00:03:07.792 --> 00:03:09.750
And they're all going to
want access to Google.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.970
They're all going to
want to live the way we

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.064
live in the developed world.

00:03:14.064 --> 00:03:15.480
So this means we've
got to provide

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.350
clean water, reliable,
renewably-produced electricity,

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.540
and access to the
internet to everybody.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.790
And that's a big job.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.692
So we got to do
everything all at once.

00:03:27.692 --> 00:03:29.560
Let's go.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.610
And so along this line,
I just tell everybody,

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.800
I'm not much for multitasking.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.250
I think that really, as much
as I love all the young people,

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.680
I think there really
isn't any such thing.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.020
Instead, you've got to keep
in mind everything that

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.730
has to be done as you
accomplish each task.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.410
Does that help?

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.820
Plus, it's a catchy
title, people.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.110
It's catchy.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.610
I'm caught.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.600
MALIK DUCARD: Yeah.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.230
All right, in reading
this book, it almost

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.650
seemed like it was a manifesto.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.940
BILL NYE: Yes.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:06.845
The nerd manifesto.

00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:08.237
MALIK DUCARD: A nerd manifesto.

00:04:08.237 --> 00:04:08.820
BILL NYE: Yes.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.530
MALIK DUCARD: That's right.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.730
BILL NYE: Do it this way.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.270
MALIK DUCARD: It's
an activist book.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.802
Where does that come from,
and what are you acting on?

00:04:19.802 --> 00:04:21.010
BILL NYE: There's two things.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.790
Everybody's responsible
for his or her own actions.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.374
This is something
my dad would say.

00:04:25.374 --> 00:04:27.540
And then you want to leave
the world better than you

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.880
found that, if you can.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.530
And if we don't
hustle, we're going

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.750
to leave the world a lot
worse than we found it.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.610
And so we got to get to work.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.050
So that's why I'm an activist.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.020
I mean, I guess.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.750
When it comes to things
like scientific literacy,

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.590
that seems like an obvious
thing to be in favor of,

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.580
because it enables companies
like this to change the world.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.350
And it also enables a country
like the United States

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.870
to remain competitive
economically,

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.390
because innovation, which is
what you guys are all about.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.460
But then, you would think
that climate change would not

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.670
be anything to argue about.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.530
It would be something
to get to work on.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.430
Yet, we have this
amazing contingent

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.140
or a segment of
our society that's

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.750
in denial about
climate change, because

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.920
of the success of
the climate deniers.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.240
They've been so influential.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.590
It's really, it's
really amazing.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.410
So that's why I wrote this book.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.690
Let's go.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:30.870
MALIK DUCARD: That's right.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:31.460
BILL NYE: When are we done?

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.940
At 1 o'clock, you guys will be--

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.710
you'll have it all
set by 1:30 or--

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.910
MALIK DUCARD: We'll
have all the answers.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.868
BILL NYE: --a quarter to
2:00, it will be done.

00:05:37.868 --> 00:05:40.650
MALIK DUCARD: And why do you
think that there are so many

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.297
deniers?

00:05:41.297 --> 00:05:43.380
BILL NYE: Oh, because of
the fossil fuel industry.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.950
I mean, that's not
rocket surgery, you guys.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.690
The fossil fuel
industry is just really

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.780
throwing money at the problem
to influence their congressmen

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.970
representatives, not just
tactically, by sending

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.880
specious materials and stuff
to the congressional staff,

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.940
but strategically,
working statewide

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.420
or commonwealth wide, in
Kentucky, Tennessee, and so on,

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.019
to the point where
it's no trouble

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:10.560
at all to meet people
who go, well, I

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.660
don't know if climate
change is really happening.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.330
Yeah, it really is.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.150
So it's a big problem, and it's
almost unique to the United

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.770
States.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.800
There's very few climate
deniers in other-- in the UK,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.750
there's quite a few, I guess.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.710
But at the recent summit of
the 20 largest economies,

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.605
the United States was isolated.

00:06:30.605 --> 00:06:33.900
It doesn't want to participate
in the Paris agreement,

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.430
and so on.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.050
One word for it would be silly.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.092
But another one would
be deeply concerning.

00:06:40.092 --> 00:06:40.800
That's two words.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.700
But it's like that.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.710
It's like that.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.330
MALIK DUCARD: And what
do you think the path is?

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.150
There's the science
behind the reality,

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.760
but then there's
also the reality

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.010
of politics, the social
engineering, that

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.320
maybe needs to be factored in.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.780
How do we get to the
place that we need to be?

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.980
BILL NYE: Well, climate
deniers, in this one case,

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.750
not so much anti-vaxxers, but
climate deniers are almost

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.280
universally old.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.270
They're almost all older
people, over 50 years, 60,

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.830
70 years old, people who
control a lot of the money.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:23.890
And when those people age
out, as the saying goes--

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:28.470
the other expression
for that is die--

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.000
then the young people--

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.436
if you've ever seen the map--
maybe you guys generated it.

00:07:32.436 --> 00:07:33.360
It was Survey Monkey.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.900
There is a map of the electoral
college of only millennials

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.440
that voted, and
it's overwhelmingly

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.670
the other way on social issues,
especially climate change.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.970
So I think climate
change deniers, who

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.930
are affiliated with the
conservative parties,

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.470
are very much aware of that.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:57.600
And so there's a big hustle to
get very conservative judges

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.670
put in place in
the Supreme Court

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.490
and to maintain this
denial as long as possible,

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.010
to get as many regulations
turned over as possible,

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.640
as quickly as possible.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.960
But when you guys get
to be the majority

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.090
of the voting of
the electorate, this

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.120
will all have to be re-reversed.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.900
And it'll happen.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:21.150
But for people like
me, my life will

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.850
suck a little bit near
the end, but you guys,

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:25.980
your lives will
really suck, because--

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:33.100
once the carbon dioxide, methane
stuff are in the atmosphere,

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.380
you just don't get them out.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.460
Carbon dioxide lasts a
couple hundred years.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.630
Its cycle is about
five years, but it

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.711
gets replaced by another
carbon dioxide molecule.

00:08:41.711 --> 00:08:43.919
And that's going to go on
for a couple hundred years.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:47.337
The analogy is you have
a roast in the oven

00:08:47.337 --> 00:08:48.920
or a turkey in the
over, or whatever--

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.610
I know, OK, this is
use your imagination,

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:52.810
vegans, just imagine.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:55.744
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:57.160
After you take it
out of the oven,

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.600
the heat is still
working its way

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.070
into the middle for a long time.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:03.220
And that's what's going
to happen to the earth.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.920
So we want to get to work on
climate change as fast we can.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.760
MALIK DUCARD: How
much time do we have?

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.593
BILL NYE: Well, everybody
argues about that,

00:09:08.593 --> 00:09:11.080
that people will be
around indefinitely.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.020
You can't kill humans.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.060
They're crazy.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.630
But you want to have the
highest quality of life

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:20.230
for as many people as possible.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.030
Santa Monica beach is cool.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:22.750
Why bury it?

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.490
Why put it under water?

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:25.640
Come on.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.102
Let's keep it.

00:09:27.102 --> 00:09:29.200
MALIK DUCARD: Can I read
a passage from your book?

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.150
BILL NYE: What if I said no?

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.960
What would that do?

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:32.270
MALIK DUCARD: I'd go
to the next question.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:33.811
BILL NYE: Read the
whole thing, yeah.

00:09:33.811 --> 00:09:34.660
Turn it up loud.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.040
Come on, Malik.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.002
Let them hear you outside.

00:09:38.002 --> 00:09:39.600
Blow the roof off the dump.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.900
Let's go.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:41.740
Blast it.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.890
MALIK DUCARD: So you
write, "A lot of what

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:47.210
I've done over the
past four decades,

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.630
including writing the book
that you're reading now,

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.690
was inspired by the need to
help people understand what it

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.450
means to be a global species.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.900
The challenge is taking
responsibility for our actions,

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.360
assuming deliberate
control of the change.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.980
We're all in this together.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:06.260
Nerds don't give up when
there's a problem to be solved.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.890
And so I've kept working
on my climate message,

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.700
redoubling my efforts to
try everything all at once."

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:13.550
BILL NYE: Yes!

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:14.620
MALIK DUCARD: What
have you been doing?

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:15.370
BILL NYE: Brilliant.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:16.203
MALIK DUCARD: It is.

00:10:16.203 --> 00:10:17.200
It is.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.160
And thank you for that.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.620
And what have you been
doing all at once?

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.160
This has really been your life.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.380
BILL NYE: Well, I come here.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.200
I wrote another book,
which takes time.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.140
I don't know if you've tried it.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.220
And I go to college campuses.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:31.760
I speak.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.670
I go to US Congress.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:35.710
I go to the
Astronautical Congress,

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.650
which is a huge party
of rocket people.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:42.940
And we talk about climate
change and Bill's big three--

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.730
clean water, renewable
electricity, and access

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.390
to the internet.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:50.020
And for example, at the
Astronautical Congress,

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.510
to provide access to the
internet in the developing

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:55.090
world will almost
certainly involve

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:59.800
what we call space assets, what
other people call satellites.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.950
And they're going to have
to be in low-earth orbit,

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:04.990
a constellation of a
few hundred of them.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:09.460
And they'll hand off the
internet service from one

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:13.130
to the other, the way we do
with mobile phone calls--

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.107
and this all seems to
be doable, but doing it

00:11:16.107 --> 00:11:18.190
at reasonable cost, and
who's going to pay for it,

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.690
and who benefits,
and so on and so on?

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.620
So these are issues
that we can solve,

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.710
that you guys especially, with
the efficiency of the internet,

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.030
are going to be a huge part of.

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.800
And I appreciate it, man, woman.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.226
MALIK DUCARD: So let's switch
gears a little bit to--

00:11:35.226 --> 00:11:37.350
BILL NYE: Switch gears, an
older reference, for you

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:38.875
electric vehicle operators.

00:11:38.875 --> 00:11:39.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:40.480
MALIK DUCARD: That's
right, that's right.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.438
BILL NYE: I know many of
you may have bicycles.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.670
And they're not
Fixies, not singles.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:51.970
These are gear shift,
17-speed, 21-speed, yeah.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.711
MALIK DUCARD: You talk a
lot about the nerd mindset

00:11:54.711 --> 00:11:55.210
and really--

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.106
BILL NYE: I know
nothing about it.

00:11:57.106 --> 00:11:58.480
MALIK DUCARD:
--and embracing it.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.700
BILL NYE: Yes, it's
not a Fixie, no.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.930
It's a 17-speed, 21-speed.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:03.430
Yeah, sorry.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.580
I'm sorry.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.330
MALIK DUCARD: So what
is the nerd mindset?

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:08.360
How do you describe it?

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.890
BILL NYE: So everybody's
passionate about something,

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:12.790
right?

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.350
You guys at Google, especially,
there's a some thing.

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:16.600
You're in the business, right?

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.974
There's some thing
that you think is cool

00:12:18.974 --> 00:12:20.140
and you're passionate about.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.350
We want to get everybody
to harness that passion,

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:28.159
to accomplish great things,
to save the world for humans.

00:12:28.159 --> 00:12:30.700
You know, I remind everybody--
the earth is going to be here,

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.330
no matter what we do.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.970
I want to save it
for me, the human.

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:38.080
We're in the sixth extinction.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.780
This is all very serious biz.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:43.790
We are now not just the
ancient dinosaurs who

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:44.960
were killed by the asteroid.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.410
We are also the asteroid.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:49.420
We're on both ends
of this thing.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.310
So we can change.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:52.660
We have free will.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.340
Or nominally, we have free will.

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.620
Certainly, we have
the ability to reason.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:01.360
So I want everybody to
harness their nerdiness

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.590
and make the world better.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:06.040
And my claim, for
your evaluation,

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:10.810
is that the people who wrote
the US Constitution were nerds.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:12.820
They thought it was cool.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.100
We're going to have a
brand new government

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.940
without a king or a queen.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:17.440
What?

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.970
Yeah, it's going to be cool.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:22.450
And it'll be like
Athens, only on

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:25.470
a whole continent-size scale.

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:29.110
And yes, to be sure, there
were some issues, some issues

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:30.466
with people of your ancestry.

00:13:30.466 --> 00:13:31.840
MALIK DUCARD:
Yeah, that's right.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.820
BILL NYE: But they were doing
the best they could at the--

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.220
I think, at the time,
doing the best they could.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.210
But they were nerds.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:41.140
They looked at this, at
running a government,

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:46.750
with an analytic or a
critical thinking perspective.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:50.220
You know, Article 1,
Section 8, US Constitution,

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:54.150
refers to the progress of
science and useful arts.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.215
That's us, people.

00:13:56.215 --> 00:14:00.270
Useful arts, I think
in 18th century speak,

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:02.070
was engineering--

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:04.050
making buildings
and sewer systems,

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.170
and stuff like that,
the useful arts.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:11.400
No, they are.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.670
You guys, people have said--

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:14.250
Malik, and we'll
get back to work--

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:17.670
but people have
said, hey, Bill Nye,

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.160
what's the most
important invention ever?

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.144
And you can tell they want me to
say the Google phone, you know,

00:14:23.144 --> 00:14:23.685
or something.

00:14:23.685 --> 00:14:25.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.540
But to me, the most important
invention humans came up

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.330
is a sewer, absolutely.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.575
You could not have any city like
this without a sewer system.

00:14:33.575 --> 00:14:36.510
And you've got to be thoughtful.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:40.470
I mean, you've got to
plan on a city-size scale.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:45.790
So viva la sewer.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:49.200
MALIK DUCARD: Now, you
talk about the nerd mindset

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.980
and how it should really
be applied to big problems.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.770
And you make a distinction
between the big problems

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.060
and the trivial problems.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:57.840
Can you talk--

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.880
BILL NYE: What's
a trivial problem?

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.630
Like your shoe laces?

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:07.982
See, he has to double
knot his shoes.

00:15:07.982 --> 00:15:10.090
And so does she and
the guy next to her.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:14.670
Not me.

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:18.085
The same knot that stays here
all day doesn't come untied.

00:15:18.085 --> 00:15:20.460
You have to double knot,
because they come untied, right?

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.070
MALIK DUCARD: They do.

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:21.570
They have.

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:23.520
BILL NYE: The word
that breaks my heart,

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.280
the phrase breaks my
heart, does not do enough.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.925
I think it just crushes me.

00:15:27.925 --> 00:15:31.710
So every day, I look out
and see the mistied shoes.

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:33.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.060
And I realize my life's
kind of been a waste.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.910
It's kind of a failure.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.440
So here's the thing, you guys.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.216
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:41.216 --> 00:15:43.090
MALIK DUCARD: Let's get
a close-up if we can.

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.330
BILL NYE: Well,
it's just that these

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.210
are shoelaces, or bow tie-ins.

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:53.490
Everybody is familiar with this
expression, an overhead knot,

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:56.970
one wrap around
the other string.

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:59.465
If I were to do this--

00:15:59.465 --> 00:16:02.380
oh, it's hard to do,
it's so troubling--

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.130
where your knot goes up and
down your shoe like this,

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:08.020
as yours does when
you start, right?

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.570
The loads on this
knot are uneven.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.600
They're unsymmetrical.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.120
So this knot comes
untied readily.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.290
Yes, it's heartbreaking.

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:18.960
Yes, it sucks.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:23.640
But what you want is for the
knot to be square, symmetrical.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.320
Now, notice if I pull these--

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.140
the way, Bill, dude--

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.320
if you pull them
this way, you end up

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.020
with a square not, a beautiful,
symmetrical square knot.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.410
For any sailors here, this
is also called a reef knot,

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:40.050
for reefing the sails, for
making the sail smaller

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:40.730
in strong wind.

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:41.861
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:41.861 --> 00:16:43.110
No, it's a real thing.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:44.402
Reefing a sail is a real thing.

00:16:44.402 --> 00:16:45.901
MALIK DUCARD: We
do have a close-up.

00:16:45.901 --> 00:16:47.430
BILL NYE: Oh, I see, yeah, yeah.

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:52.500
So this is what you want in
your bow, is a square bow.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.810
So you're saying,
that's trivial,

00:16:54.810 --> 00:17:00.276
all the shoes walking
around the earth mistied?

00:17:00.276 --> 00:17:05.640
Hah, hah-- just
thinking about it.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.430
I'm OK.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:10.246
Yes, lead on, Malik, yes.

00:17:10.246 --> 00:17:12.329
MALIK DUCARD: By the way,
I think you just created

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:15.910
the, what will be the, number
one how-to video on YouTube,

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.264
since this will be--

00:17:17.264 --> 00:17:18.680
BILL NYE: It's the
same knot here.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.170
MALIK DUCARD: --on YouTube.

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:20.461
BILL NYE: OK, this is the same.

00:17:20.461 --> 00:17:21.531
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:21.531 --> 00:17:23.280
MALIK DUCARD: Let's
please get a close-up.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:27.900
BILL NYE: We'll wait
till you're up and close.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:32.780
They're probably not listening.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:33.370
MALIK DUCARD: That's fine.

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:33.871
There we go.

00:17:33.871 --> 00:17:34.370
We got it.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:35.130
We got it now.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.780
BILL NYE: Anyway, so it's
an overhand knot, right?

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.850
That's an overhand
knot, overhand knot,

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:44.640
or whatever you want to call
it, one string around the other.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.400
Then you got to make
a loop on your shoe.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:47.950
Can we?

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:51.560
We can't do this too fast.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.970
On your shoe, you make a loop.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:58.230
Now, whether you do it this
way or make bunny ears,

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.494
it works the same.

00:18:00.494 --> 00:18:02.410
But you go around the
loop with the other one.

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:04.076
And then you've got
to poke that through

00:18:04.076 --> 00:18:07.560
to create the other
half of the bow.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.570
This is not controversial.

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:11.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:16.710
So here-- don't
worry about that--

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:20.130
here, you've got to
make a loop, same idea.

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:23.130
And then by tradition, the
way I was brought up you

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:24.870
have this one go over the top.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.339
That way, gravity helps, yes.

00:18:26.339 --> 00:18:27.880
Well, what if you're
in zero gravity?

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:28.590
I seldom.

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:29.554
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:29.554 --> 00:18:32.661
I mean, we can always hope.

00:18:32.661 --> 00:18:35.830
So the key to it, you guys,
you have to preserve a place,

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:37.890
so when this is wrapped
around your finger,

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:40.090
there's still space there.

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:46.120
And then you push this
through, like as we do.

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.760
And so then you have
to-- with any knot,

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.410
you have to dress the knot.

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:51.870
You have to snug it tight.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.810
It's not magic.

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:55.090
It's not rocket surgery.

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:58.750
You just have to
tighten it evenly.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.910
And then you have a bow.

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:02.070
And I'll just with

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:03.050
everybody.

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:03.550
Thank you.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:08.230
Bill Nye tied it,
tie his own shoe.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:11.330
So then, when you
have a bow tie--

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:13.120
I don't see a lot of
ties here at Google--

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:18.010
but when you lean over, it
doesn't slip into the soup.

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:21.000
It does not flip-flop
into your flask.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.800
And so this is why
you wear a bow tie.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.410
I mean, you watch the
Oscars or whatever,

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:28.740
and the guys are all in tuxedos.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:29.680
They wear bow ties.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.270
Once in a while,
a guy will show up

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:34.120
with a single button,
because he's so cool,

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.360
or a black tie on a black
shirt with a black--

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.655
OK, whatever.

00:19:38.655 --> 00:19:40.210
But when you're
dressed up, you wear

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:41.840
a black tie on a white shirt.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:46.840
You don't wear a blue shirt when
you're dressed up in a tuxedo.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.060
And everybody-- this is
just, when you're dressed up,

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.450
you wear a bow tie, people.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:53.435
That's alls I'm saying.

00:19:53.435 --> 00:19:58.600
OK, now, "bt-dubs," as the
kids say, just this morning,

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.221
"Bill Nye Saves the World"
was nominated for two Emmys.

00:20:01.221 --> 00:20:01.720
That's cool.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.496
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

00:20:03.496 --> 00:20:04.820
Don't come running to me.

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:09.280
Although I am one
of the writers,

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.730
you're only allowed to
put five names on it.

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:15.880
So we have five names of
some of the other writers--

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.520
Prashanth, Venkat,
Cece Pleasants,

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:22.210
Mike Drucker, Sanden Totten.

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:24.370
And did I mention Cece?

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:25.150
I did.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:26.860
And I mentioned Mike.

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:27.880
I'm fine.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.340
Michael Naidus is not--
nor am I. We're not on it.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:33.040
So it's going to be--

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.106
I mean, you don't
win the first time,

00:20:35.106 --> 00:20:36.480
but it's always
cool to be there.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.590
And I'll wear a tux.

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:40.000
And I also wear slacks.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.370
I wear pants.

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:42.857
MALIK DUCARD: It's a great show.

00:20:42.857 --> 00:20:44.440
BILL NYE: Everybody
there wears pants.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.522
All the guys wear pants.

00:20:45.522 --> 00:20:48.201
The ladies don't, though.

00:20:48.201 --> 00:20:49.950
MALIK DUCARD: So we'd
love to talk about--

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:51.200
BILL NYE: Am I going too fast?

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.054
MALIK DUCARD: No,
this is excellent.

00:20:53.054 --> 00:20:57.370
Bu we'd love to talk
about when you grew up.

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:59.500
Growing up, you tell
so many great stories

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:07.000
about wearing a bow tie and your
parents, your dad, your mom.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.040
BILL NYE: My dad showed me how
to tie a bow tie around my leg,

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:10.720
tie it.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.880
This is about the same
diameter as your neck.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.600
So you can practice
around your leg

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.980
during one of your
Netflix weekends.

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:24.190
MALIK DUCARD: And your
mom was an innovator.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:29.410
She, out of college, I think
it was, went into the military

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:30.220
to crack codes.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:31.690
BILL NYE: Yeah, well,
she was recruited.

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:33.023
MALIK DUCARD: She was recruited?

00:21:33.023 --> 00:21:36.310
BILL NYE: So my dad was a couple
of years older than my mother.

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:37.310
It was very traditional.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:40.980
And he wanted to build
up the nest egg for them.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:44.590
And her father would not let
them get married until she

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:46.960
was graduated from college.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.610
I mean, this is in--

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:51.010
my dad went to Johns
Hopkins, in Baltimore,

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:53.860
and my mom went to
Goucher College,

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:57.880
which used to be the sister
school to Hopkins, women only.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.170
But now, they let boys in.

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:00.710
My mom would say, you
know, it's gone to hell.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:01.328
But--

00:22:01.328 --> 00:22:03.555
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:03.555 --> 00:22:04.420
--it was all women.

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:09.130
And my dad went--

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:14.530
before the US Navy had the
CBs, before that existed,

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.500
they hired contractors,
construction firms,

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.300
to do heavy lifting.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.630
So my dad got a job with
a construction company

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:24.880
on Wake Island.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.070
And if you've ever heard
of it, you go to Hawaii,

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:30.239
and then you go that far again,
another 5,000 nautical miles,

00:22:30.239 --> 00:22:31.780
out in the middle
of nowhere, there's

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.540
an atoll that's
tactically important.

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.130
You can refuel a ship there.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.830
And that's where they used
to refuel the flying boats,

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:41.800
the Boeing clipper airplane.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:46.330
And anyway, they were bombed on
December 8th, 1941, which was

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:48.040
December 7th in Pearl Harbor.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.536
It's the same day because of
the International Date Line.

00:22:51.536 --> 00:22:53.410
Wake is beyond on the
International Date Line

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:54.770
when flying east to west.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:58.450
And so he was a prisoner
of war for four years.

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:02.364
If you get a chance to be
a prisoner of war, don't.

00:23:02.364 --> 00:23:02.864
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:02.864 --> 00:23:05.140
It just sucked.

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:09.760
But my mom was graduated
in 1942, that spring.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.360
Her boyfriend had disappeared.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.260
They were bombed.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.490
The radio was destroyed.

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:17.090
They had no communication.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:22.180
They didn't have Facebook
or YouTube or Twitter.

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.805
I know, yeah, what
did they do all day?

00:23:23.805 --> 00:23:24.346
I don't know.

00:23:24.346 --> 00:23:25.510
They did something, yeah.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:28.520
Excuse me.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:33.850
And so the head of
Goucher College,

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:36.820
the dean of students at
Goucher, was Dorothy Stimson,

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.950
who was the first cousin
of Henry Stimson, who

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.500
was the Secretary of War.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.500
And this is back in
the day, everybody.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.069
He apparently said
to her, do you

00:23:45.069 --> 00:23:47.110
have any ladies that can
come work on this thing?

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:48.980
I can't tell you what it is.

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.960
So my mom worked
on the Enigma code,

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.220
which is this notorious
thing in World War II.

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:54.950
And my whole life,
people would ask her,

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:56.615
what did you do during the war?

00:23:56.615 --> 00:23:59.000
I can't talk about it, ha ha.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.719
I can't talk about it.

00:24:00.719 --> 00:24:01.760
And they had a big party.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.760
They were declassified in 1992.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.120
MALIK DUCARD: Wow, wow, wow.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.900
BILL NYE: 50 freaking years
after they were recruited,

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.057
and they still wouldn't-- my
nephew tried to do a report.

00:24:12.057 --> 00:24:13.640
And they still
wouldn't, none of them.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.473
There were seven ladies
there at that point.

00:24:15.473 --> 00:24:17.270
They would not talk about it.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:19.130
It was a thang.

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:19.910
It was a thang.

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:21.650
MALIK DUCARD: Wow,
wow, wow, wow.

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:25.500
And then, an incredible
groundbreaker, your mom,

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.562
can talk about her influence
on you and science?

00:24:28.562 --> 00:24:29.270
BILL NYE: Oh yes.

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:30.920
So my mom-- you know
this expression,

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.870
teach a man to fish.

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.990
My mom was big on
teach a woman--

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:36.920
give a woman a fish,
she'll eat today.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.040
Teach a woman to fish, she'll
eat the rest of her life.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:40.910
I can sew.

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:41.690
I can cook.

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:43.010
I can do the dishes.

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:44.390
I can vacuum.

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:46.700
I have some competency,
because she made

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.650
us learn to do those things.

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:50.600
I still have two
sewing machines.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.510
But one of them's
really good for zig-zag.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:54.721
I don't have to tell you.

00:24:54.721 --> 00:24:55.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:55.220 --> 00:25:00.920
But my ladies, my mom marched
in the Equal Rights Amendment

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.830
parade in 1973.

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:04.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.420
Thank you, yes.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.400
I didn't do it.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.030
But no, she did it.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:10.160
And she tells on
me, and she said

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.080
she threw her bra in the fire.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.880
I don't know if she
really did, but that's

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.320
what she said she did.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:19.010
I was not in a position
to verify that.

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:20.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:23.045
And this is before
the women's march.

00:25:23.045 --> 00:25:24.440
This is 1973.

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.560
And the legacy of those
days is with us now.

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.920
I mean, look, half the employees
at Google here are women.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:34.900
In my parents' time,
that was not the case.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:38.420
There were very, very,
very few women engineers,

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:42.140
no women computer coders
back then, very, very few.

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:46.240
So she was part
of that vanguard.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.324
And I get it.

00:25:48.324 --> 00:25:50.990
I mean, I say all the time, half
the humans are women and girls,

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:53.720
so let's have half the engineers
and scientists be women.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.800
What?

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:55.690
What?

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:57.306
You're twice as
many brains, right?

00:25:57.306 --> 00:25:58.178
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:58.178 --> 00:26:00.069
So it will better brains.

00:26:00.069 --> 00:26:01.360
Women are better at everything.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.230
OK, all right, OK.

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:05.850
I'm playing the hand
I was dealt here.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:06.930
I'm a guy.

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:08.164
All right.

00:26:08.164 --> 00:26:10.330
MALIK DUCARD: I mean, we
still have more work to do.

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:11.038
You know, we're--

00:26:11.038 --> 00:26:12.057
BILL NYE: Yeah, I guess.

00:26:12.057 --> 00:26:13.390
MALIK DUCARD: We're not at half.

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:14.410
BILL NYE: Yeah, Yeah.

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:15.785
MALIK DUCARD: How
do we encourage

00:26:15.785 --> 00:26:18.454
more diversity, more women and
girls, to get into to science?

00:26:18.454 --> 00:26:19.870
BILL NYE: Well,
diversity, I mean,

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:21.111
Malik, I'm checking you out.

00:26:21.111 --> 00:26:23.110
I think you've probably
been through some things

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:26.250
that I can't even imagine
on account of your ancestry,

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:27.420
right?

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:31.872
Nobody just pulls me over
driving while dorky white guy.

00:26:31.872 --> 00:26:33.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:38.760
So anyway, it's a
process, everybody.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.440
We just got to stick with it.

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:45.030
You can have high expectations,
but I encourage everybody

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:48.150
not to let your fury get in
the way of getting things done.

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:50.280
We're all ticked off
about something--

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.440
not me, of course.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:55.070
I'm totally smooth.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:56.190
So it's a long journey.

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:59.550
But I guess you support
people based on merit,

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:02.640
rather than ancestry or gender.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.800
MALIK DUCARD: That's right.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.130
BILL NYE: Well, thanks, Bill.

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:05.630
Thank you.

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:07.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.090
Thanks obvious-- "ob-v."

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:12.330
as the kids say, "ob-v."

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:15.480
MALIK DUCARD: So Bill Nye, the
Science Guy, and then there's

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.192
Bill Nye, the comedy guy,

00:27:17.192 --> 00:27:17.775
BILL NYE: Yes.

00:27:17.775 --> 00:27:19.399
MALIK DUCARD: They're
one and the same.

00:27:19.399 --> 00:27:20.510
BILL NYE: Sure.

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:22.170
It's not only am I funny.

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:22.999
I'm what, Malik?

00:27:22.999 --> 00:27:24.165
That's right, funny-looking.

00:27:24.165 --> 00:27:24.870
MALIK DUCARD: Funny-looking,

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:25.230
BILL NYE: Yes.

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:26.313
MALIK DUCARD: There we go.

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.710
And I thought it was so
interesting, the comedy.

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:36.870
So can you tell us about your
experience in stand-up comedy?

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:41.460
BILL NYE: So what
happened was a guy I

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.800
would have been a freshman
roommate with in college--

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.610
I went into mechanical
engineering.

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:48.990
He went into material
science, Dave Laks.

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:50.280
But we still stayed in touch.

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:54.000
We just would go to
school in buildings

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.560
next to each other
in the engineering

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:56.910
quadrangle at Cornell.

00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:01.810
And one afternoon, he
comes hurrying to my house.

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:04.140
We lived near each other
in Ithaca, New York,

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.870
in this area called
College Town.

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:10.285
And he came hurrying--
you got to see this.

00:28:10.285 --> 00:28:11.160
You won't believe it.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.201
You got to come see this.

00:28:12.201 --> 00:28:16.590
So he had this crazy,
new thing in 1977.

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.080
He had cable television.

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.850
Whoa, dude.

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:24.450
And so they had on there,
was running in the rotation,

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:27.000
was Steve Martin at
the Boarding House,

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.630
which was a nightclub
in San Francisco.

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:29.338
It's still there.

00:28:29.338 --> 00:28:30.990
The Boarding House
is still a revered--

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:34.440
it's like Whisky A Go-Go
kind of thing, been there

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.350
for years and years.

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:36.704
And so it was Steve Martin.

00:28:36.704 --> 00:28:37.870
And I went and looked at it.

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:40.680
And the guy, Dave, said, look,
this guy is just like you.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:41.380
Look at this.

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:42.210
He's just like you.

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:43.980
His sensibility
is just like you.

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:45.480
MALIK DUCARD: Can
we show slide two?

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:49.195
BILL NYE: Slide two.

00:28:49.195 --> 00:28:51.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:56.370
They're distinguishable,
but not by much.

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:59.760
So then the year later,
Warner Brothers Records

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.970
sponsored a Steve Martin
lookalike contest.

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:05.220
And by then, I'd been
recruited by Boeing.

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:09.060
I was living in Seattle,
working in Everett, Washington,

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.980
for you zip code buffs.

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:15.540
Everett, Washington, right
on, the world's largest volume

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:19.020
building, where they
built, at that time, 747.

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:23.130
Now they build 777, 787.

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:26.990
And so I entered
that, and I won.

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.880
I mean, I won.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:34.480
It was, I claim, as I told
Steve when I met him once--

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.940
I have met him--

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.270
I strongly believed
that I got what

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:42.480
he was driving at in a way that
the other contestants didn't,

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.060
this absurdist
view of the world.

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:48.000
I did not win the national one.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.070
That guy was from Nashville.

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:51.960
He could play the banjo,
for crying out loud.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.751
Steve Martin, if you
know, he's well-known.

00:29:53.751 --> 00:29:56.520
He's won Grammys for
his banjo playing.

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.420
But he also kind
of looked like him,

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.990
which was a step I
didn't really take.

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:04.800
So well, anyway,
after you get laughs,

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.520
you know it's very inspiring.

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:08.190
It's addicting.

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:09.810
You want to get
laughs all the time.

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:12.450
So I started doing
stand-up comedy.

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:15.780
And then I met some
people, some guys,

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:22.230
who were being groomed or
recruited by the Seattle NBC's

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:23.610
affiliate station, KING.

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:30.360
Seattle's in King
County, Washington.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.520
And by the way, it's
been retroactively

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:36.890
named King County on account
of Martin Luther King, who

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:39.300
was not around in the 1850s.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.610
But it's charming.

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:44.940
Anyway, they wanted
to have a comedy show.

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:47.490
And so they asked me to
be in a couple of bits.

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:50.050
And it was funny,
or funny enough.

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:53.000
And then I eventually
quit my job

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.960
after awhile, October
3rd, 1986, roughly.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:00.835
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:05.780
At that time, you guys, computer
aided design and computer

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:08.740
aided manufacturer, computer
machining, were just coming on.

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:10.690
It was like this new thing.

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:14.280
Do you guys, you compete with
CATIA, or do you own them?

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:16.120
Yeah, you probably own them.

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.840
Anyway, it was new technology.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:22.450
And I felt that if I dropped
out of engineering, even

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:26.280
for six months, I wouldn't
be able to rejoin,

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:27.560
to get back in it.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.660
Seattle was not Silicon
Valley, but sort of.

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:34.480
And I worked at Boeing and then
the company called Sunstrand,

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.830
what makes all the black
boxes for airplanes

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.280
and which is now Honeywell.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:41.470
They got bought out.

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:46.420
But I took a chance.

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.230
And it worked out.

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:48.920
I kept making a living.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:53.320
And then eventually-- so
I would work part time.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.010
I was one of the last
guys, as far as I know,

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:58.720
one of the last guys to
work on a drawing board,

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.330
with the ch-ch-ch, with
the lead holders-- oh,

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:04.150
we don't call them
pencils, oh no--

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:07.430
and an electric eraser and
a little racing shield.

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:09.350
And they lay out
these big things,

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:13.960
like this, big sheets of paper,
to make these tiny instruments

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.130
sort of things.

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:16.920
Sorry.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.710
No, you'd lay it out 10
to 1, sometimes 100 to 1,

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:22.810
to make things that
are as big as a watch.

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:25.210
You know how the accelerometer
in a competitive product

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:27.940
can tell you which way
the phone's oriented?

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:30.670
It was the early days of
that stuff, lithography,

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:31.930
on a very small scale.

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:35.800
So anyway, it took a long time.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.780
I quit my job in
'86, and I started

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:42.090
doing the Science Guy Show
in-- we did a pilot in 1992.

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:46.045
So it was six years of
dinking around, trying to--

00:32:46.045 --> 00:32:48.400
we did the landmark
and important video,

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:53.150
"Fabulous Wetlands," about
how great wetlands are.

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:56.314
And that was sort of served as
a template for the show with Jim

00:32:56.314 --> 00:32:58.480
McKenna and Aaron Gottlieb
and these other producers

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.081
I fell in with.

00:33:00.081 --> 00:33:01.330
Did that answer your question.

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:01.630
MALIK DUCARD: Yeah, it did.

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:04.100
BILL NYE: Or did you want to
take up the whole hour with me

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.800
talking about these details?

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:08.840
This is one of your people.

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.250
The guy's like six feet tall.

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:11.392
How tall is that guy?

00:33:11.392 --> 00:33:13.100
MALIK DUCARD: Not yet,
but getting there.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.145
BILL NYE: He's got to
be like 5'10", isn't he?

00:33:15.145 --> 00:33:16.270
MALIK DUCARD: Pretty soon--

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:17.269
BILL NYE: Look out, Dad.

00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:20.050
Look out.

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:21.940
MALIK DUCARD: So
you're probably one

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:26.080
of the only people who has
gotten advice from both Jerry

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.330
Seinfeld and Carl Sagan.

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:29.980
BILL NYE: Yes, of course.

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:31.250
I roll with both.

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:34.060
MALIK DUCARD: You roll
in interesting circles.

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:37.240
What was the advice that
you got from Jerry Seinfeld?

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.990
BILL NYE: Oh, so, you
guys, on his way up,

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:43.750
Jerry Seinfeld would come
through Seattle on the circuit.

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:46.060
He'd go Portland, Oregon,
Seattle, Vancouver, British

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:50.590
Columbia, San Francisco,
New York, Chicago.

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:53.632
Comedians, comediennes
still do it.

00:33:53.632 --> 00:33:55.090
Anyway, when he
was in Seattle, you

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:59.650
could go have brunch with him
on Sunday morning at this place,

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:00.990
either at--

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:03.520
there's two Starbucks
stores in Seattle

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:07.630
that both claim to
be the first one.

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:09.699
At one of the first
Starbucks, you

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:12.380
could go there and have coffee
with him, on Sunday morning

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:12.880
especially.

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:16.420
And he said he liked to dress
better than the audience.

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:18.480
That was his advice.

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:23.118
And you know, if you watch
the Seinfeld episodes,

00:34:23.118 --> 00:34:25.159
in the beginning, he has
a little stand-up thing.

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:28.909
He's in a sport coat
and tie and a shirt.

00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:32.380
But if you look at
Louis C K, he doesn't

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:33.710
adhere to that rule at all.

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:35.409
But I-- no, I mean, he doesn't.

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:36.409
He's a different deal.

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:37.780
And he's brilliant.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:40.300
So I embraced that.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:44.739
Then the other thing he said
is, when you're there, be there.

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:49.270
It's a real-- when you
start doing stand-up comedy,

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:50.199
you're nervous.

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:52.449
You're afraid that
the audience will

00:34:52.449 --> 00:34:54.980
hate you, which is very likely.

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.357
And so you lose your focus.

00:34:56.357 --> 00:34:58.690
You get worried about what
they think of you rather than

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:00.520
your hilarious comedy jokes.

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:04.030
And so that was good advice,
those two little scraps

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:05.010
of advice I have held.

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:07.000
And I attribute it
to Mr. Seinfeld.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.895
He was very nice to us, to
all of us, the young guys.

00:35:11.895 --> 00:35:14.770
Like he's 10 years older
than I am, kind of thing.

00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:16.680
And maybe he's less
than that, Bill.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.420
And he's a huge success.

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.750
You-- and so.

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:25.892
Those are two really
good pieces of advice.

00:35:25.892 --> 00:35:27.850
MALIK DUCARD: I would
love to talk about space.

00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:29.297
BILL NYE: Space, huge fans.

00:35:29.297 --> 00:35:31.380
How many people are members
of the planetary site?

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:32.850
Anybody?

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:34.690
Oh, I suck.

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:36.150
One guy, thank you, yes.

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.730
So consider.

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:40.090
Check us out at
planetary.org, advancing

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:41.365
space science and exploration.

00:35:41.365 --> 00:35:42.490
MALIK DUCARD: That's right.

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:43.330
That's right.

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:44.289
So that's your day job.

00:35:44.289 --> 00:35:45.246
BILL NYE: That's right.

00:35:45.246 --> 00:35:47.230
MALIK DUCARD: Can you
talk about your day job

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:50.170
as CEO of the Planetary Society?

00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:54.460
BILL NYE: So you guys, I've
worked for a lot of people.

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:58.000
And I make a lot of
jokes about my old boss.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.040
None of the jokes
are flattering.

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.960
But my old boss--
and what an idiot

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.210
he was-- but there
is no one old boss.

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:07.220
It's an amalgam.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:09.140
You all work for
fabulous bosses,

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:11.750
and you're always happy,
and there's no conflict here

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:15.470
at Google. no, no, yes.

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:19.040
But now I'm in charge of a
couple, a few dozen people, 30

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.270
people.

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:23.510
And I've learned a lot.

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:27.077
You want to work with people
who share the objective so

00:36:27.077 --> 00:36:28.910
that you're all trying
to do the same thing.

00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:32.010
And you want to work with
people that are competent.

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:36.290
But competency is not all
that difficult to come by.

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:38.780
It's getting the chemistry,
getting the people together,

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:39.710
that can produce.

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:42.590
And so I've learned
a lot doing that.

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:45.170
But we want to do
at the Planetary

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:49.040
Society is advance space
science and exploration.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:52.850
I submit to you that
we are living at a time

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:56.550
when we may discover
life on another world.

00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:58.460
And if we were to find
life on another world,

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:00.293
it would change the
course of human history.

00:37:00.293 --> 00:37:03.040
It would be like
Copernicus showing

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.290
the earth goes around the
sun instead of the other way

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:06.300
around.

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.800
Or Galileo-- I know the moon
looks like a perfect circle,

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.880
but if you take this telescope,
you can see it's full of bumps.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.630
Well, we're going to
have to imprison you.

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:16.040
I know.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.950
But it's still full of bumps.

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:18.938
I'm sorry, man.

00:37:18.938 --> 00:37:20.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:23.520
And you have to stay home
the rest of your life.

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.530
OK, whatever.

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:27.270
There's still bumps.

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:30.680
And so if we found life
on Mars, for example,

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:33.530
or stranger still, on
Europa, the moon of Jupiter

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:36.816
with twice as much sea
water as the earth,

00:37:36.816 --> 00:37:37.940
it would change everything.

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:38.960
I mean, I'm not saying--

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.040
I said this all the time.

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:43.160
I'm not saying we'd suddenly
drive on the left in the US.

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:45.560
We're not going to
change everything.

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.200
But it would change the way
everybody feels about being

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.920
alive in the cosmos.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.050
And so that's what the
Planetary Society does.

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:55.850
I was just at the Planetary
Protection meeting.

00:37:55.850 --> 00:37:57.620
So it's the prime directive.

00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:00.320
You don't want to take
human germs to Mars

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:02.120
and contaminate it
so that you can't

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.830
tell if there ever
were any Martian

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:06.100
germs before you got there.

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:08.420
And it's a big-- it's
a non-trivial issue,

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:11.510
getting a spacecraft
sterile enough to do that,

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:13.730
and to get it with
instruments that

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:15.260
will detect something alive.

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.405
How do you know if
it's alive or was?

00:38:17.405 --> 00:38:21.390
Is it a fossilized mat of
ancient marscrobe bacteria

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:23.510
things, or what have you?

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:24.987
And who's going to pay for it?

00:38:24.987 --> 00:38:25.820
That's our business.

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:28.790
I go to the US Congress
a couple of times a year.

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:32.240
And hey, this would
be great, man, I say.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.400
I paraphrase.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.900
Mr. Congressman, I
think this would.

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:38.780
So the other thing
about space exploration

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:40.850
that's really charming
and wonderful,

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:42.356
it brings out the best in us.

00:38:42.356 --> 00:38:42.980
It really does.

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:44.686
Do you guys know
who Adam Schiff is?

00:38:44.686 --> 00:38:46.310
He's on the news all
the time right now

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:48.800
because he's the head of
the intelligence committee,

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:52.460
some issue with Russia and
some people, some things.

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:57.309
But he's also a huge
supporter of exploring Europa,

00:38:57.309 --> 00:38:59.600
because he's a big supporter
of the Jet Propulsion Lab,

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.310
in Pasadena.

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:05.210
And then there's John Culberson,
from the Houston area, who

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:09.530
explained to me that really,
the safest place, Bill, probably

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:12.290
in the country, is
the Texas State House.

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:14.420
And Bill, what you do,
get your concealed weapons

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:17.720
permit, and get in the concealed
weapons line, the shortest

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.195
line, Bill, much faster.

00:39:19.195 --> 00:39:20.570
You get everybody's
got a weapon.

00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:22.130
Nothing is going
to happen there.

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:24.050
Good, Mr. Culberson, yes.

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:27.200
Anyway, he and Adam Schiff
disagree about almost

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:31.280
everything except the
expiration of Europa.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.470
And they work to
fund it all the time,

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:36.530
to get what's so-called flagship
mission, over $1 billion

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:38.600
mission, $4 billion mission.

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:44.580
A mission is space talk for
rocket ship thing, mission.

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:45.600
It's a mission.

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:46.697
That's what it is.

00:39:46.697 --> 00:39:47.780
You mean it's a satellite?

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:50.000
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.260
But the mission involves all
the people on the ground,

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:52.760
and so on.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.160
But they agree on this.

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.440
And I say to everybody,
in the case of the US,

00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:02.720
where we are right now,
NASA is the best brand

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:04.880
the United States has.

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.510
You can meet people
in other parts

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:07.760
of the world that hate the US.

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:08.390
They hate me.

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:09.680
They hate everything.

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.890
But they respect NASA.

00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:14.270
And so that alone is
a worthy investment

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:15.530
of our intellect and treasure.

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:19.385
So I encourage you all to check
out the Planetary Society's--

00:40:19.385 --> 00:40:22.600
Is my briefcase
over there, Susan?

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:26.170
Susan's from Rodale Press, the
company that printed the books.

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:27.423
Thank you, Susan, yes.

00:40:27.423 --> 00:40:27.923
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:27.923 --> 00:40:28.630
Hang on.

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:29.934
This will be worth it.

00:40:29.934 --> 00:40:32.600
Hang on.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:33.830
I injured my leg.

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:34.610
I'm a mess.

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:37.500
Hey, my microphone
works way over here.

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.980
Thanks, electronics.

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:44.165
So this is the thing we want you
to check out for the eclipse.

00:40:44.165 --> 00:40:45.110
Oh, that's my phone.

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:47.190
Is that good, to throw
them on the floor?

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:49.310
There's the Planetary
Society logo.

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:51.230
Wow, thanks, Bill.

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:55.520
Is it a ringed planet, or is
it the letter P for planetary?

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.690
Wait, it's both.

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:59.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.332
So these are eclipse glasses--

00:41:01.332 --> 00:41:02.290
MALIK DUCARD: Oh, nice.

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:03.110
BILL NYE: Malik.

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:05.857
So you can't see a thing.

00:41:05.857 --> 00:41:07.190
MALIK DUCARD: I need an eclipse.

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:09.023
BILL NYE: When you look
right at this light,

00:41:09.023 --> 00:41:10.820
do you see anything,
right at them?

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:11.452
No, huh?

00:41:11.452 --> 00:41:12.410
MALIK DUCARD: Not much.

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:13.610
BILL NYE: Not [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:15.140
Anyway, so these are for sale.

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.592
Check out I like you.

00:41:16.592 --> 00:41:18.050
There's a woman-owned
business I've

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:22.550
done business with for many
years, teachersource.com.

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:25.280
And the company is called
Education Innovations.

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.751
And they market them.

00:41:26.751 --> 00:41:27.500
For those of you--

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:30.260
is there anybody here who does
not have a Bill Nye bobblehead?

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:32.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:33.200
Wow.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.220
It's so weird.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:38.930
Anyway, you also get those
at Education Innovations.

00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:43.640
And so August 21st, there
will be an eclipse going right

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.250
across the world's third
most populous country.

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:49.040
And I encourage all of you to
get out there and get under it.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:52.590
If you've never seen a total
eclipse, it really is crazy.

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:54.060
It's an amazing experience.

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:57.207
And it's very reasonable,
for most of us,

00:41:57.207 --> 00:41:58.790
it will be a
once-in-a-lifetime thing.

00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:04.400
Because although there are
two eclipses every two years,

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.430
due to [WHISTLES] of
the planets and sun--

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:09.140
except it's in space,
there's no sound--

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:15.410
most of them are not
over accessible land

00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:17.600
that's easy for people
in the US to get to.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.390
So I really encourage you.

00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:24.230
Drive somewhere
and get under it.

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:26.600
And you can make it a day trip.

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:31.910
You can fly to Omaha, drive
out under the eclipse,

00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:33.920
and then go back to the
airport, and come back.

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:35.750
I mean, you don't
have to rent a cabin

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:37.010
in the woods for two years.

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:38.620
I mean, just go out there.

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:40.400
Or if you're in the
Atlanta area just

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:42.030
get-- and Portland, Oregon.

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.441
But I recommend you get
east of the mountains,

00:42:44.441 --> 00:42:46.190
if you know your way
around the Northwest,

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:49.100
because west of the mountain,
there's a good chance you'll

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:51.230
get weathered out, as we say.

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:54.200
If it's cloudy, you
don't see anything.

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:55.520
And it really is amazing.

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.510
The sky goes dark.

00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:58.280
You can see stars.

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.010
I'm hoping this one is
going to be real annular.

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:02.910
You're going to get the
ring around the sun.

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:06.080
We're hoping to see
these interference bands.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:09.890
The wavelengths of light
make these gray bands go

00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:11.520
sweeping across the landscape.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.592
It's crazy.

00:43:12.592 --> 00:43:13.550
It really is something.

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:15.590
I've seen one good
one when I was

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:19.220
in South Africa for a meeting,
and it's really something.

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:21.440
I've been near a couple
of them, but really

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.927
been under it is cool.

00:43:23.927 --> 00:43:25.010
MALIK DUCARD: August 21st.

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:25.970
BILL NYE: August 21st.

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:28.130
Don't miss it if you can.

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:30.800
And if you don't want
to spend all that money

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:33.800
on the plastic ones,
there's paper ones.

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.660
And they're OK.

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:38.350
And they're also
branded for Bill Nye.

00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:40.300
And oh yeah, you can see dimly.

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:42.050
Yeah, you can see
the LEDs, right?

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:42.680
MALIK DUCARD: Yeah, exactly.

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:43.220
BILL NYE: Yeah, yeah.

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:44.630
MALIK DUCARD: Just a little bit.

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:47.960
BILL NYE: So these
modern lights,

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:50.624
they're no longer a single
filament or a carbon arc

00:43:50.624 --> 00:43:51.540
or anything like that.

00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:55.610
There's a mixture of
little dots, right?

00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:58.040
Is this your son here,
one of these people?

00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:58.460
MALIK DUCARD: All of these.

00:43:58.460 --> 00:43:59.630
BILL NYE: Can we have
one of them come up?

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:00.580
MALIK DUCARD: Yeah.

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:01.812
Come.

00:44:01.812 --> 00:44:02.770
BILL NYE: Hi, I'm Bill.

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:03.880
What's your name, do you know?

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:04.640
JOHN HENRY DUCARD: John Henry.

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:05.600
BILL NYE: John Henry.

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:07.160
So try those on.

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.032
Oh, look at you.

00:44:08.032 --> 00:44:08.990
And look at the lights.

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:10.620
Do you see the
many colored dots?

00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:11.620
JOHN HENRY DUCARD: Yeah.

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:13.555
BILL NYE: And I
have an eyewitness.

00:44:13.555 --> 00:44:14.767
Thank you, John Henry, yes.

00:44:14.767 --> 00:44:15.850
MALIK DUCARD: Thanks, bud.

00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:16.349
All right.

00:44:16.349 --> 00:44:17.502
BILL NYE: Nicely done.

00:44:17.502 --> 00:44:18.460
Can I hold on to those?

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:19.460
I only brought one pair.

00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:21.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:22.280
MALIK DUCARD: All right.

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.405
BILL NYE: Hang on to these.

00:44:23.405 --> 00:44:24.830
MALIK DUCARD: So that's awesome.

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:25.760
And we're going to
go to the audience.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:26.890
BILL NYE: Take questions
from the audience?

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:29.630
MALIK DUCARD: Questions, and
if we can go to slide six.

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:30.910
BILL NYE: Slide six.

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:34.260
MALIK DUCARD: As we go
to audience questions,

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.810
I've got a question
for the audience.

00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:39.770
What do Bill Nye, Rihanna,
Jennifer Lawrence,

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:42.230
and Elon Musk have in common?

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:43.230
AUDIENCE: It's money.

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:44.230
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:45.830
BILL NYE: I don't
play in that league.

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:47.140
But somebody said money.

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:48.330
I don't play in that league.

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:49.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:53.000
Sorry, not yet.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.550
After we sell a few dozen
of these plastic glasses.

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:59.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:03.320
MALIK DUCARD: You are listed
as one of the top celebrities,

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:06.950
along with the other three
in the plural generation, who

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:12.260
are the generation of
13 to 20 somethings.

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:13.130
BILL NYE: Yes.

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:15.130
MALIK DUCARD: You're up
there with those three.

00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:17.540
BILL NYE: I mean, I'm
considered a celebrity

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:19.070
among people that age.

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:19.260
MALIK DUCARD: That's right.

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:19.610
AUDIENCE: Woo!

00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:20.588
BILL NYE: Wow, right on.

00:45:20.588 --> 00:45:21.566
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

00:45:21.566 --> 00:45:24.500
So that's great to know.

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:28.130
So what I found, as a celebrity
among people of that age,

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:37.460
if I go to a Starbucks and
order a vanilla latte, it's $4.

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:39.170
Without that, it's $4.

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:41.570
So it's just a fantastic thing.

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:44.783
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:45.832 --> 00:45:48.040
MALIK DUCARD: All right,
questions from the audience.

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:49.010
SPEAKER 1: So I'm
going to throw you

00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:50.894
this thing, if you
want to ask questions,

00:45:50.894 --> 00:45:52.310
because it has a
microphone in it.

00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:53.070
And that--

00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:54.820
BILL NYE: That's a
thing, the blue thing.

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:55.840
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:56.550
We can throw it.

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:57.300
It won't hurt you.

00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:57.850
It's foamy.

00:45:57.850 --> 00:46:00.680
BILL NYE: Oh, it's
in a bounceable cube.

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:01.579
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:46:01.579 --> 00:46:02.620
BILL NYE: Well, prove it.

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:04.745
Just roll it on the floor,
and see who picks it up.

00:46:04.745 --> 00:46:06.620
Let's just try that.

00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:08.060
Not so fast, yeah.

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:09.140
He was making--

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:11.420
SPEAKER 1: Real quick, before
I throw this at people.

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:14.090
We do have a bookseller
right outside.

00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:17.070
We have subsidized copies of the
book you've been hearing about.

00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:19.220
So please buy one, if
you want to read it.

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:20.672
Who has a question?

00:46:20.672 --> 00:46:22.130
BILL NYE: And I
signed them, right?

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:23.775
Those are the ones
we did yesterday.

00:46:23.775 --> 00:46:25.954
Yeah, I signed 550
of them yesterday.

00:46:25.954 --> 00:46:26.870
MALIK DUCARD: Awesome.

00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:27.650
BILL NYE: It took a few minutes.

00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:29.483
MALIK DUCARD: And we
can move off the slide.

00:46:29.483 --> 00:46:30.890
BILL NYE: With a fountain pen.

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:33.440
Because if you're buying
a book, I love you, man.

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.580
Showing some respect.

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:37.160
Yes, so we have a question?

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.470
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Julian.

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:39.470
BILL NYE: Where are you?

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:41.720
Raise your hand way above--
oh, there you are, Julian.

00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:43.279
The blue thing, yes.

00:46:43.279 --> 00:46:45.320
AUDIENCE: What do you
think that the government's

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:47.480
role in science should be?

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:50.465
And what do you think it
has been historically?

00:46:50.465 --> 00:46:52.340
BILL NYE: Well,
historically, the government,

00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:54.170
our government
anyway, has supported

00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:57.860
science basic research,
mostly at universities.

00:46:57.860 --> 00:46:59.490
And then it trickles down.

00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:01.430
Then we have a whole
thing, or we used to,

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:03.395
called the Department
of Education,

00:47:03.395 --> 00:47:04.265
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:04.265 --> 00:47:10.070
which studies how people
learn and supports

00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:14.400
schools, public schools,
which I attended.

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:18.440
So we reason we
invest in science

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:22.280
is to stay competitive,
to innovate,

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:24.470
competitive in two ways--
economically, on the world

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:26.270
stage.

00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:29.220
You know-- people
made fun of him--

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:32.420
but when you build
interstate highways that

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:36.350
enable people to come to
work at Google, that is

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:39.860
a form of supporting science.

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:44.150
And then the other thing
is in national defense.

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:47.540
Weapons are almost
continually being innovated,

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:51.920
being modified and improved
and made more effective.

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:54.650
And the big thing
nominally, until recently,

00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:57.470
the big thing was to have
cool weapons, not use them.

00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:59.540
And that was the big idea.

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:04.320
But it's getting weird, peoples.

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:06.170
It's getting weird.

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:10.790
So the government,
in my opinion,

00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:12.160
should invest in science.

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.470
And that's what keeps
everybody competitive.

00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:16.240
There's a whole thing where--

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:21.630
I was on the TV the other
day with Grover Norquist,

00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:24.130
a guy who says he wants
to shrink the government

00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:26.930
and drown it in a bathtub.

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:29.680
I don't think that's
what you really want.

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:32.620
After that, do we just drive
on either side of the street?

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:33.820
Is that OK?

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:35.290
And no stop lights?

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:37.390
Cool, really fun.

00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:38.470
No fire departments?

00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:39.830
You sure about that?

00:48:39.830 --> 00:48:41.740
So what happens with
those guys, in general,

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:44.320
they talk a good game
until push comes to shove,

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:47.830
till the sewer backs up, until
the military is not funded.

00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:49.460
Then they freak out.

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:53.290
So supporting basic
research is very important.

00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:55.090
And whatever
innovations you all can

00:48:55.090 --> 00:49:00.940
do to help everybody-- all
the internet or information

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:04.510
technology people around
the world, thank you.

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:06.190
Does that answer your question?

00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:07.150
AUDIENCE: Yes,
thank you so much.

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:08.740
BILL NYE: Saying something
like that and doing it

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:09.880
is two different things.

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:10.960
MALIK DUCARD: Let's
throw the mic.

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.430
I think we've got a question
over here in the front.

00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:14.910
BILL NYE: I want to see it
thrown, because it was-- yes!

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:15.220
MALIK DUCARD: There you go.

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:16.390
A good grow and good catch.

00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:17.560
BILL NYE: You could
have played pro ball.

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.300
You could have
played pro ball, yes.

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:21.050
AUDIENCE: Since we
know you're an advocate

00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:23.680
of the non-useful arts, what
would be your advice to those

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:25.230
who pursue those as a career?

00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:26.710
BILL NYE: What's
a non-useful art?

00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:27.820
AUDIENCE: Well, you
were making that joke

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:30.370
that the founding fathers
were referring to useful arts

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:31.870
as engineering and science.

00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:34.594
BILL NYE: No, but in the 19th
century, the 18th century,

00:49:34.594 --> 00:49:36.760
I mean, I don't think they
had the word engineering.

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.764
It wasn't used the
way we use it today.

00:49:38.764 --> 00:49:40.180
AUDIENCE: Well, I
guess then, just

00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:41.805
to clarify the
question, would be, what

00:49:41.805 --> 00:49:44.630
would be your advice for
those who are pursuing comedy

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:45.930
or music production art--

00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:47.500
BILL NYE: Do it!

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:50.710
AUDIENCE: --in a world that's
more predominately focused

00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:53.580
on math, science, engineering?

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:56.410
As our governments clearly
are winnowing and sifting

00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:58.510
towards that
direction, for people

00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:01.090
who are in the creative fields,
what would be your advice,

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:02.080
I guess is my--

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:03.190
BILL NYE: Is do it.

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:05.170
That's my-- just get started.

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:05.899
That's my advice.

00:50:05.899 --> 00:50:07.690
AUDIENCE: And do you
feel like they're just

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:09.190
as important as
those other fields?

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:13.160
BILL NYE: You can't have a world
without art, OK, everybody?

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:15.260
Art improves your life.

00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:16.940
I mean, come on.

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:21.190
We are in this architected
space that brings out emotions,

00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:22.724
make you feel a certain way.

00:50:22.724 --> 00:50:23.890
Yes, you've got to have art.

00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:25.840
So what's going on--

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:26.490
so OK.

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:27.400
All right.

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:28.210
Everything's fine.

00:50:28.210 --> 00:50:30.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:32.290
I grew up with
the space program.

00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:34.270
People my age had
the space program.

00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:38.505
So science was imbued,
was embedded, in society.

00:50:38.505 --> 00:50:41.080
It was just part of
what went on every day,

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:44.440
along with this crazy optimism
that science scientists

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:46.060
and engineers could
solve any problem.

00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.470
We're going to go to the moon.

00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:49.120
We're going to do this.

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:52.870
The Apollo program was
4% of the federal budget.

00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:56.400
NASA's budget now is 0.4%.

00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.100
It was literally
10 times as big.

00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:02.380
So science was just
around all the time.

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:05.770
Cars had fins on them
like rockets, not

00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:07.720
for any utilitarian
purpose, just

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:10.780
to remind us all of
how cool rockets were.

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:14.600
And then so that effort
was-- that was really

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:16.540
an informal form of warfare.

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:19.180
When that was resolved,
this went away.

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:21.794
So now, there's been this
emphasis on STEM, STEM, STEM,

00:51:21.794 --> 00:51:23.710
STEM-- science, technology,
engineering, math,

00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:26.110
STEM, STEM, STEM, STEM,
STEM school, STEM wing,

00:51:26.110 --> 00:51:28.450
STEM teacher, STEM [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:31.150
And then, people
quite reasonably

00:51:31.150 --> 00:51:33.230
said, well, what about art?

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:36.820
So now there's STEAM, science,
technology, engineering, art,

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:37.610
and math.

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:41.377
Then I'd come, from time
to time, I mean STEAMAD--

00:51:41.377 --> 00:51:43.210
science, technology,
engineering, art, math,

00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:44.000
and design.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:44.500
OK.

00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:46.291
Pretty soon, we're
going to call it school.

00:51:46.291 --> 00:51:49.305
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:54.290
It's just the pendulum's
going to swing.

00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:57.430
You do not want a world without
art, for crying out loud.

00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:59.830
But you do not want a
world without science.

00:51:59.830 --> 00:52:02.440
So all right, that's
what happened,

00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:06.040
my interpretation-- which,
as you know, is correct.

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:07.540
MALIK DUCARD:
Questions in the back?

00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:09.480
BILL NYE: Really
his interpret-- yes.

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:11.136
Bill Nye ought to correct this.

00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:15.212
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:52:15.212 --> 00:52:17.230
Eric, you-- you go first.

00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:19.810
BILL NYE: I love
the flying cube mic.

00:52:19.810 --> 00:52:22.120
AUDIENCE: So my
question is around

00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:24.310
engaging climate deniers.

00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:27.190
In this crowd, you're largely
preaching to the choir.

00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:30.100
Most of us have friends where
we're preaching to the choir.

00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:32.380
What can you suggest
for us to engage people

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:34.570
to make a difference,
instead of just talking

00:52:34.570 --> 00:52:35.950
to people who agree with us?

00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:38.710
BILL NYE: Well, so I say
all the time, talk about it,

00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:42.550
and ask people why they don't
believe the world's climate is

00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:43.660
changing.

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:46.476
And most people you meet
really are nervous about it.

00:52:46.476 --> 00:52:47.350
That's my experience.

00:52:47.350 --> 00:52:49.510
Climate deniers are
nervous about it.

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:53.154
I was on the radio this
morning in Miami, Florida.

00:52:53.154 --> 00:52:55.195
And they're just-- everybody
is talking about it.

00:52:55.195 --> 00:52:57.220
The tides are higher every year.

00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:59.140
Every full moon, the
tides are higher,

00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:01.090
what they call king tides.

00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:04.330
And when there's a
low pressure system,

00:53:04.330 --> 00:53:08.260
it shows up in Florida
on the 9 o'clock side

00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:12.130
of a counterclockwise
weather system.

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:15.796
Then the tides are even higher,
a so-called storm surge.

00:53:15.796 --> 00:53:17.170
And they're all
talking about it.

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:19.087
Norfolk, Virginia,
Galveston, Texas--

00:53:19.087 --> 00:53:20.170
they're all talking about.

00:53:20.170 --> 00:53:25.120
So if you keep talking about it,
eventually, things will change.

00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:29.840
I don't think the US government
will be able to keep--

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:31.310
will stay in denial.

00:53:31.310 --> 00:53:33.730
I just think they'll
run out of steam--

00:53:33.730 --> 00:53:34.739
STEAM.

00:53:34.739 --> 00:53:35.530
The professionals--

00:53:35.530 --> 00:53:36.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:39.820
--at the Environmental
Protection Agency and US

00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:42.185
Geological Survey and
the Weather Service

00:53:42.185 --> 00:53:43.810
are just not going
to put up with this.

00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:46.840
Eventually, things
will turn around.

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:48.706
Just we want it to be
as fast as possible.

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.040
Right?

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:55.250
My wishfully thinking, yeah.

00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:58.220
Scott Pruitt, really?

00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:01.700
The head of the EPA is a guy
who wanted to shut down the EPA?

00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:03.110
Really?

00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:06.350
Rick Scott, the
governor of Wisconsin,

00:54:06.350 --> 00:54:08.602
won't say the word evolution.

00:54:08.602 --> 00:54:10.310
I mean, Scott Walker
won't say evolution.

00:54:10.310 --> 00:54:13.430
Rick Scott's the
governor of Florida,

00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:16.790
tried to forbid anybody from
using the phrase climate change

00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:18.235
in meetings of legislators.

00:54:18.235 --> 00:54:19.785
Oh, that will do it.

00:54:19.785 --> 00:54:22.787
Yeah, that's all you got to
do is just not talk about it.

00:54:22.787 --> 00:54:24.160
Gee whiz.

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:27.270
These are real people
running a real country.

00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:29.090
It's amazing.

00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:31.690
MALIK DUCARD:
Let's get the cube.

00:54:31.690 --> 00:54:34.680
Let's take one or
two more questions.

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:35.930
AUDIENCE: Oh, I do have a--

00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:36.535
MALIK DUCARD: Oh, please, yeah.

00:54:36.535 --> 00:54:37.070
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sorry.

00:54:37.070 --> 00:54:38.420
MALIK DUCARD: Over to you.

00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:40.044
AUDIENCE: First of
all, loved your show

00:54:40.044 --> 00:54:41.390
as I was growing up, as a kid.

00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:42.866
BILL NYE: I love you, man.

00:54:42.866 --> 00:54:43.640
I do.

00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:44.627
Thank you.

00:54:44.627 --> 00:54:45.710
AUDIENCE: This is awesome.

00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:48.200
I just wanted to
know, besides science,

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:52.880
if you were involved with
the making of your theme song

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:54.080
that's so iconic--

00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:55.827
the Bill, Bill,
Bill, Bill, Bill.

00:54:55.827 --> 00:54:56.660
BILL NYE: I know it.

00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:57.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:57.660 --> 00:54:58.411
It's a great song.

00:54:58.411 --> 00:54:59.743
AUDIENCE: I just had to hear it.

00:54:59.743 --> 00:55:01.400
BILL NYE: I mean,
I did the voice,

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:03.290
Science is a property of matter.

00:55:03.290 --> 00:55:05.319
I mean, yeah, I did
the lip sync, I mean.

00:55:05.319 --> 00:55:06.110
But I was involved.

00:55:06.110 --> 00:55:09.650
But the guy that did
it was named Jim Green.

00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:11.690
And he has a company
called 38 Fresh.

00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:14.084
He was a producer
here in Los Angeles.

00:55:14.084 --> 00:55:14.750
He's a good guy.

00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:16.541
AUDIENCE: Were there
any different versions

00:55:16.541 --> 00:55:19.220
that you had to choose from
for the show, when you had--

00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:22.970
BILL NYE: If there were, you
guys, it was 23 years ago,

00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:24.500
and I don't remember any.

00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:26.300
I mean, if there were
different versions,

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:29.420
they might be some
scratch tracks that

00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:32.540
were sort of the same thing at
a different beats per minute.

00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:35.908
But it's just no, I mean,
as far as I remember.

00:55:35.908 --> 00:55:36.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:40.070
And then Tyler, the
creator, did this song

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:42.950
for "Bill Nye Saves the
World," saves the world.

00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:43.700
He's a good guy.

00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:45.395
I hung out with him one morning.

00:55:45.395 --> 00:55:46.610
And he's a funny guy.

00:55:46.610 --> 00:55:48.470
And we're going to have
him on the new show.

00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:50.360
We start shooting
again on Tuesday.

00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:51.290
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:53.250
BILL NYE: Start 12 more shows.

00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:54.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:56.750
So he tried to make
it-- or he did make

00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:59.360
a derivative of the old song.

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:00.580
But I don't sing the songs.

00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:02.900
Does everybody know that?

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:04.010
You hire that out.

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:05.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:10.040
So the example I give you all,
even if you're not of an age--

00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:11.990
"Gilligan's Island."

00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:13.580
Gilligan doesn't sing the song.

00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:15.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:15.110 --> 00:56:17.930
So Bill Nye doesn't sing
the song of his own show.

00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:21.860
There's one exception
in broadcast history--

00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:22.490
"Frasier."

00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:27.360
Kelsey Grammer sang
the "Frasier" Song,

00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:28.639
with the scrambled eggs.

00:56:28.639 --> 00:56:29.180
Yeah, I know.

00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:31.280
I can't explain it.

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:33.110
MALIK DUCARD: Let's
do one more question.

00:56:33.110 --> 00:56:33.430
I thought I saw--

00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:35.263
BILL NYE: But "Frasier"
was a derivative bit

00:56:35.263 --> 00:56:39.230
from "Cheers," Jimmy Burrows.

00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:40.345
Yes?

00:56:40.345 --> 00:56:41.090
Some more--

00:56:41.090 --> 00:56:41.881
AUDIENCE: I guess--

00:56:41.881 --> 00:56:44.787
BILL NYE: You need the blue
mic, the house of blue mics.

00:56:44.787 --> 00:56:45.620
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:46.720
I guess I have this.

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:49.900
So I just wanted to
follow up a little more

00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:53.200
on the question the
gentleman with the beard

00:56:53.200 --> 00:57:00.170
asked before, about
essentially, I guess,

00:57:00.170 --> 00:57:03.230
I think it's uncontroversial
that you're not really

00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:06.920
like a stranger to debates
that are controversial.

00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:09.920
And I guess I find that,
I don't know, sometimes,

00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:13.820
I'll argue with people who
I radically disagree with.

00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:17.450
And it quickly becomes
clear that in no way

00:57:17.450 --> 00:57:19.670
is it going to be fruitful.

00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:21.830
For example, I know
all these people

00:57:21.830 --> 00:57:24.050
who are right-wing,
populist extremists

00:57:24.050 --> 00:57:25.910
from my hometown in Tennessee.

00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:28.010
And you talk to them
about immigration.

00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:30.110
And you're like, well,
what about the human cost

00:57:30.110 --> 00:57:32.030
of that ridiculous
policy you're proposing?

00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:34.488
And they're like, oh, yeah,
well, what about the human cost

00:57:34.488 --> 00:57:36.890
of what Hillary
Clinton did in Libya?

00:57:36.890 --> 00:57:38.810
And I'm just curious.

00:57:38.810 --> 00:57:40.580
To what extent do
you think it's worth

00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:43.517
engaging with people with
whom you radically disagree?

00:57:43.517 --> 00:57:45.350
BILL NYE: Well, I think
it's worth engaging.

00:57:45.350 --> 00:57:49.490
What happens, it's wherever
the cities are big enough

00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:52.190
to have people cross
paths, they get

00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:55.970
over this immigration thing.

00:57:55.970 --> 00:57:58.816
I think that'll
shake itself out.

00:57:58.816 --> 00:58:01.820
The smaller-- like St.
Louis is an interior city.

00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:03.410
It's not a coastal city.

00:58:03.410 --> 00:58:06.170
Minneapolis is not
a coastal city.

00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:08.660
But you'll find that
the people have lawsuits

00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:12.710
or the state attorney
generals have lawsuits

00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:16.730
against this policy, because
the big cities have diversity.

00:58:16.730 --> 00:58:18.420
And you do business
with your neighbors,

00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:21.770
and you just-- my understanding
is you get over it.

00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:26.300
So you just challenge
your friends to travel.

00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:27.280
You go to New York.

00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:29.060
It's a real place.

00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:31.250
There are fewer murders
per day in New York

00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:33.080
than any major
metropolitan city,

00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:37.220
because the city
freaked out after 9/11.

00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:39.470
There's a cop on every corner.

00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:40.999
And you never get
lost in New York,

00:58:40.999 --> 00:58:43.540
because you can ask directions
of all the cops on the corner.

00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:45.650
It's fabulous.

00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:47.900
And encourage them
to go to Paris

00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:49.360
and see what people are like.

00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:52.280
Wow, people eat food, cool.

00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:53.300
Did not know that.

00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:58.340
And I think it's just
we got to get along.

00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:03.620
What you all do at Google
is democratize the internet,

00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:06.560
you know, democratize
interaction,

00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:07.620
social interaction.

00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:09.890
So it's a long process.

00:59:09.890 --> 00:59:13.100
But I encourage you to
engage people about anything

00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:14.310
like that.

00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:16.940
And as far as immigration
policies, it is--

00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:24.940
OK, no aunts or uncles, no
grandparents, can go-- really?

00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:26.530
Have you thought this through?

00:59:26.530 --> 00:59:28.310
So we'll see what happens.

00:59:28.310 --> 00:59:31.390
I don't think that
policy will last.

00:59:31.390 --> 00:59:34.550
Because the court system,
I think, is robust enough.

00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:36.670
But we'll see what happens.

00:59:36.670 --> 00:59:39.890
I tell everybody-- I
remember when Nixon resigned.

00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:41.470
I'm that old.

00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:44.560
It took a year and a
half for all that stuff

00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:45.560
to catch up with him.

00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:49.015
So we'll see what happens
in the coming months.

00:59:49.015 --> 00:59:51.985
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:51.985 --> 00:59:53.965
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:53.965 --> 00:59:56.110
Well, maybe nothing will happen.

00:59:56.110 --> 00:59:57.814
I mean, it's not my idea.

00:59:57.814 --> 00:59:59.230
MALIK DUCARD: Can
you talk quickly

00:59:59.230 --> 01:00:02.050
about your national
service idea?

01:00:02.050 --> 01:00:04.970
BILL NYE: Oh yeah, my national
service idea-- this is great.

01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:07.990
So Bill, you chose not
to join the military,

01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:09.130
and you've got an opinion?

01:00:09.130 --> 01:00:10.900
Yeah!

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:16.270
So people my age, the reason
I did not go to Vietnam

01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:20.020
was because, basically,
I'm six months too young.

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:23.930
I missed getting
drafted by six months.

01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:28.155
I had to register for the draft,
and your height and weight

01:00:28.155 --> 01:00:28.780
and everything.

01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:31.430
And you get ready to
be enlisted, and stuff.

01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:35.740
But then, the draft was
abolished right before.

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:36.846
I was born in November.

01:00:36.846 --> 01:00:38.470
I went to kindergarten
when I was four.

01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:44.260
So I didn't turn 18 till
my senior in high school.

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:46.360
So I missed the draft
by a few months.

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:49.240
But my older brother's
friends were deeply

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:52.210
affected by the Vietnam
War in a bad way.

01:00:52.210 --> 01:00:54.850
But nevertheless, because
of my parents' experience

01:00:54.850 --> 01:00:58.720
with the military, my dad
was, many years later,

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:01.660
declared a veteran, because
they had served with Marines

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:05.150
and prisoner of war camp.

01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:08.500
I looked into Air Force ROTC.

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.030
And I wanted to fly jets.

01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:11.950
I thought that would be cool.

01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:14.490
I went to get my
physical, and there

01:01:14.490 --> 01:01:16.610
were a bunch of
pilots sitting there

01:01:16.610 --> 01:01:19.480
in an Air Force Base
in Rome, New York,

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:24.010
for you rural New York buffs.

01:01:24.010 --> 01:01:26.140
And I said, how often
do you guys fly?

01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:30.207
Oh, every six weeks,
sometimes every two months.

01:01:30.207 --> 01:01:31.540
What do you do the rest of time?

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:34.920
Oh, we memorize procedures.

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:37.130
Wow.

01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:39.130
Doesn't sound like much fun.

01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:42.360
So I did not join the military.

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:44.730
But if I had been required
to, I certainly would have.

01:01:44.730 --> 01:01:48.570
So my proposal is that we
have a national service

01:01:48.570 --> 01:01:52.470
akin to the Americorp,
akin to the Peace Corps,

01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:54.150
where everybody had to join.

01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:57.660
So in my parents' day,
everybody my parents' age,

01:01:57.660 --> 01:01:59.880
when they would meet
at any situation--

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:04.409
waiting in line at the grocery
store, when they would go out

01:02:04.409 --> 01:02:05.950
dancing, when they'd
go out to dinner

01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:10.350
at a restaurant, when they'd
pick up kids at school-- what

01:02:10.350 --> 01:02:13.050
they all talked about was
what they did during the war,

01:02:13.050 --> 01:02:13.680
World War II.

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.410
Because this thing
was such a big deal,

01:02:16.410 --> 01:02:18.510
it bound everybody together.

01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:21.857
People of all faiths,
of all ancestry,

01:02:21.857 --> 01:02:23.190
were all in this thing together.

01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:28.050
So my proposal is that we have
a national service that you have

01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:31.410
to complete before you turn 26.

01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:33.490
And then we would
all be involved.

01:02:33.490 --> 01:02:34.950
And if you join
the military, that

01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:37.280
would count, of course,
for your national service.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:40.890
It would be involved here
domestically or maybe overseas,

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:42.350
all in this thing together.

01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:45.240
And yes, yes, crazy
Uncle Bill, it

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:47.430
would have to be paid
for with tax dollars.

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:50.070
Ahh, ahhh-ahh-ahh!

01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:52.480
But we would get
infrastructure, Bill.

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:56.490
We would get schools connected
to the internet, for example.

01:02:56.490 --> 01:02:58.300
And everybody would
be required to do it,

01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:01.000
and we'd all take it for
granted that we had to do it.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.640
And I think it would bind
us together and ultimately,

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:06.570
save money.

01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:09.330
And we wouldn't have this
red state, blue state,

01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:11.610
horrible division,
that we're nurturing

01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:14.080
or we're end up with right now.

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:15.240
And it's a crazy idea.

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:19.620
But the idea is, if you wanted
to, you could finish college,

01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:23.160
undergraduate, before you
did your national service.

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:26.400
If you, like my dad, didn't
think law school sounded

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:29.352
like all that much fun, you
would do your national service

01:03:29.352 --> 01:03:30.060
right after that.

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:32.730
If you were obsessed and crazy,
like a few of you are crazy,

01:03:32.730 --> 01:03:36.330
just are interested in
your academic success,

01:03:36.330 --> 01:03:39.720
and you wanted to
get your PhD, you

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:42.390
would take your national service
after you got your masters

01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:44.190
degree, before you
went back for your PhD.

01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:45.610
That's my proposal.

01:03:45.610 --> 01:03:47.190
Bill, that'll never fly.

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:48.460
Everybody hates each other.

01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:50.293
We don't want to spend
any more tax dollars.

01:03:50.293 --> 01:03:51.270
I know, OK.

01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:55.110
So what if each state
had a state service?

01:03:55.110 --> 01:03:58.620
In California, state service
would put pressure on Nevada

01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:02.010
to have a Nevada state service,
and an Arizona state service.

01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:04.305
Oregon would sure as heck
put pressure on Washington

01:04:04.305 --> 01:04:06.060
to have a state service.

01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:08.780
And then maybe this could
become a national service.

01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:11.130
It's a proposal.

01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:12.630
It's a little crazy.

01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:14.760
I'm glad you asked about it.

01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:17.209
But the idea is that we'd
all have a common purpose

01:04:17.209 --> 01:04:18.750
so we wouldn't have--
you know, there

01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:24.480
was 15 minutes after 9/11, where
everybody was rah, rah, US,

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:29.070
in a constructive way,
as horrible as that was.

01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:31.230
And so a national
service is just one

01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:32.557
of my kooky little ideas.

01:04:32.557 --> 01:04:33.390
MALIK DUCARD: Great.

01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:34.004
That's great.

01:04:34.004 --> 01:04:34.920
BILL NYE: It could be.

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.295
MALIK DUCARD:
We're going to wrap

01:04:36.295 --> 01:04:38.070
with some quick,
rapid-fire questions.

01:04:38.070 --> 01:04:39.486
BILL NYE: Oh yes,
lightning round-

01:04:39.486 --> 01:04:41.460
bing, bing, bing,
bing, bing, bing, bing.

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:43.840
MALIK DUCARD: Your
favorite teacher?

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:46.894
BILL NYE: Mr. Lang,
physics, 11th grade.

01:04:46.894 --> 01:04:49.310
Don't get me-- I mean, not
that I didn't like Mr. Morrison

01:04:49.310 --> 01:04:50.185
and Miss [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:50.185 --> 01:04:51.810
MALIK DUCARD: OK,
one of your favorite?

01:04:51.810 --> 01:04:54.150
BILL NYE: Yeah, yeah, Mr.
Lawrence, in sixth grade,

01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:55.966
freaking changed my life.

01:04:55.966 --> 01:04:57.840
MALIK DUCARD: One of
your favorite characters

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.776
from fiction books?

01:04:59.776 --> 01:05:00.900
BILL NYE: Oh, Captain Kirk.

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:01.980
MALIK DUCARD: Captain
Kirk, there you

01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:03.420
go-- beautiful Captain Kirk.

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:05.870
If you could be an
animal for a day?

01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:07.351
BILL NYE: Well, I am an animal.

01:05:07.351 --> 01:05:11.419
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

01:05:11.419 --> 01:05:12.210
Hey, you know what?

01:05:12.210 --> 01:05:14.168
I don't know, a successful
pelican or something

01:05:14.168 --> 01:05:14.810
[INAUDIBLE].

01:05:14.810 --> 01:05:15.630
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:17.340
You don't want to
get eaten, you know.

01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:19.807
You want to be the eator.

01:05:19.807 --> 01:05:21.390
MALIK DUCARD: You've
worked with a lot

01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:24.050
of great educational YouTubers--

01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:28.350
one that you really
enjoyed working with?

01:05:28.350 --> 01:05:31.110
BILL NYE: Physics Girl
Diane, oh yeah, she's great.

01:05:31.110 --> 01:05:32.900
Emily Calandrelli is great.

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:37.350
And Derek Muller, Veritasium,
he's really great.

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:38.090
He's a good guy.

01:05:38.090 --> 01:05:39.090
MALIK DUCARD: Fantastic.

01:05:39.090 --> 01:05:42.739
Self-driving car or
a human-powered bike?

01:05:42.739 --> 01:05:44.280
BILL NYE: Well, a
human-powered bike,

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:47.520
if the distances are suitable.

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:51.450
I mean, it's a self-driving
car if I lived in Studio City.

01:05:51.450 --> 01:05:54.120
It's 22, 23 miles to get here.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.747
I mean, you could do it.

01:05:55.747 --> 01:05:57.830
But then, I got to go to
San Diego this afternoon.

01:05:57.830 --> 01:06:00.300
I mean, you have to be
a heck of an athlete.

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:02.840
I'm sure I could do it, sure.

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:04.430
But a self-driving
car, you guys,

01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:09.360
I think about my grandfather
went into World War I

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:11.370
on a horse.

01:06:11.370 --> 01:06:13.830
Nobody went into World
War II on a horse.

01:06:13.830 --> 01:06:15.760
Nobody was serious
about it, I mean,

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:17.010
who wanted to live through it.

01:06:17.010 --> 01:06:20.760
So everything
changed in 25 years.

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:22.870
Everything changed.

01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:27.120
So I can drive a
stick shift, great.

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.370
That and $4 will
get you the latte.

01:06:29.370 --> 01:06:31.900
I mean, it's a skill
you don't need any more.

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:33.358
MALIK DUCARD: And
then the last one

01:06:33.358 --> 01:06:37.970
for the win, potential
energy or kinetic energy?

01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:41.350
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:44.570
BILL NYE: You know, you
exchange one for the other.

01:06:44.570 --> 01:06:46.070
You want to be in
motion if you can.

01:06:46.070 --> 01:06:47.153
MALIK DUCARD: There we go.

01:06:47.153 --> 01:06:48.340
BILL NYE: There we go, yeah.

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:50.037
MALIK DUCARD: Let's all
give it up for Bill Nye.

01:06:50.037 --> 01:06:50.995
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

01:06:50.995 --> 01:06:53.310
Thank you so much.

01:06:53.310 --> 01:06:55.560
But if somebody can
hold up the book,

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.101
let's get a close-up
of the book.

01:06:57.101 --> 01:06:58.350
You got to check out the book.

01:06:58.350 --> 01:06:59.641
Please buy the book.

01:06:59.641 --> 01:07:00.390
It's a great read.

01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:01.223
Thank you very much.

01:07:01.223 --> 01:07:02.960
BILL NYE: Yes, thank you.
