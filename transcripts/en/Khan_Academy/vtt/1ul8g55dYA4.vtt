00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.060
I will now do a proof for which
we credit the 12th century

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.044
Indian mathematician, Bhaskara.

00:00:08.044 --> 00:00:09.460
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.210
going to start with a square.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.750
So let me see if I
can draw a square.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.210
I'm going to draw it
tilted at a bit of an angle

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.910
just because I think it'll make
it a little bit easier on me.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.600
So let me do my best
attempt at drawing something

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.670
that reasonably
looks like a square.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.490
You have to bear with me if it's
not exactly a tilted square.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.389
So that looks pretty good.

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:34.680
And I'm assuming it's a square.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.430
So this is a right angle.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.840
This is a right angle.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.850
That's a right angle.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.841
That's a right angle.

00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:42.340
I'm assuming the lengths of all
of these sides are the same.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.130
So let's just assume that
they're all of length, c.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.430
I'll write that in yellow.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.790
So all of the sides of the
square are of length, c.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.420
And now I'm going to construct
four triangles inside

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.270
of this square.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.030
And the way I'm going to do it
is I'm going to be dropping.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.020
So here I'm going
to go straight down,

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.560
and I'm going to drop a
line straight down and draw

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.047
a triangle that looks like this.

00:01:06.047 --> 00:01:07.630
So I'm going to go
straight down here.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.964
Here, I'm going to
go straight across.

00:01:09.964 --> 00:01:11.380
And so since this
is straight down

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.180
and this is straight across,
we know this is a right angle.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.980
Then from this
vertex on our square,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.590
I'm going to go straight up.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.460
And since this is straight up
and this is straight across,

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.230
we know that this
is a right angle.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.980
And then from this
vertex right over here,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.920
I'm going to go
straight horizontally.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.870
I'm assuming that's
what I'm doing.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.500
And so we know that this is
going to be a right angle,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.790
and then we know this is
going to be a right angle.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.260
So we see that we've
constructed, from our square,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.310
we've constructed
four right triangles.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.240
And in between,
we have something

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.520
that, at minimum, looks like a
rectangle or possibly a square.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.090
We haven't quite
proven to ourselves

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.064
yet that this is a square.

00:01:51.064 --> 00:01:52.730
Now the next thing I
want to think about

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.220
is whether these
triangles are congruent.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.860
So they definitely all
have the same length

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.760
of their hypotenuse.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.301
All of the hypot-- I don't know
what the plural of hypotenuse

00:02:01.301 --> 00:02:03.250
is, hypoteni, hypotenuses.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.430
They have all length, c.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.840
The side opposite the right
angle is always length, c.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.157
So if we can show that all
the corresponding angles are

00:02:11.157 --> 00:02:12.740
the same, then we
know it's congruent.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.031
If you have something where
all the angles are the same

00:02:15.031 --> 00:02:17.102
and you have a
side that is also--

00:02:17.102 --> 00:02:18.810
the corresponding side
is also congruent,

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.980
then the whole
triangles are congruent.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.050
And we can show
that if we assume

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.820
that this angle is theta.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.930
Then this angle right over
here has to be 90 minus theta

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.790
because together they
are complimentary.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.850
We know that because
they go combine

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.750
to form this angle of the
square, this right angle.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.660
And this is 90 minus theta.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.240
We know this angle
and this angle

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.760
have to add up to
90 because we only

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.200
have 90 left when we subtract
the right angle from 180.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.745
So we know this has to be theta.

00:02:48.745 --> 00:02:50.760
And if that's theta, then
that's 90 minus theta.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.260
I think you see
where this is going.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.360
If that's 90 minus theta,
this has to be theta.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.540
And if that's theta, then
this is 90 minus theta.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.170
If this is 90 minus
theta, then this is theta,

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.990
and then this would have
to be 90 minus theta.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.500
So we see in all four
of these triangles,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.550
the three angles are theta, 90
minus theta, and 90 degrees.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.720
So they all have the
same exact angle,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.190
so at minimum, they are
similar, and their hypotenuses

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.040
are the same.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.210
So we know that all
four of these triangles

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.950
are completely
congruent triangles.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.940
So with that
assumption, let's just

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.320
assume that the longer
side of these triangles,

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.060
that these are of length, b.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.016
So the longer side of
these triangles I'm

00:03:38.016 --> 00:03:38.890
just going to assume.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.580
So this length right over here,
I'll call that lowercase b.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.160
And let's assume that the
shorter side, so this distance

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.340
right over here, this distance
right over here, this distance

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.170
right over here, that these
are all-- this distance right

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.130
over here, that these
are of length, a.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.740
So if I were to say this
height right over here,

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.720
this height is of length--
that is of length, a.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.530
Now we will do
something interesting.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.460
Well, first, let's think about
the area of the entire square.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.772
What's the area of the
entire square in terms of c?

00:04:14.772 --> 00:04:16.380
Well, that's pretty
straightforward.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.320
It's a c by c square.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.220
So the area here is
equal to c squared.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.960
Now, what I'm going
to do is rearrange

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.080
two of these triangles
and then come up

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.850
with the area of that other
figure in terms of a's and b's,

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.760
and hopefully it gets us
to the Pythagorean theorem.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.330
And to do that, just so we
don't lose our starting point

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.610
because our starting
point is interesting,

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.270
let me just copy and
paste this entire thing.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.910
So I don't want it to clip off.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.150
So let me just copy
and paste this.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.960
Copy and paste.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.900
So this is our original diagram.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.310
And what I will now
do-- and actually, let

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.236
me clear that out.

00:05:01.236 --> 00:05:02.900
Edit clear.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.310
I'm now going to shift.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.630
This is the fun part.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.620
I'm going to shift this
triangle here in the top left.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.795
I'm going to shift it below this
triangle on the bottom right.

00:05:11.795 --> 00:05:14.440
And I'm going to attempt to do
that by copying and pasting.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.210
So let's see how much--
well, the way I drew it,

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.450
it's not that-- well,
that might do the trick.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.300
I want to retain a little
bit of the-- so let me copy,

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.930
or let me actually cut it,
and then let me paste it.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:34.030
So that triangle I'm going
to stick right over there.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.380
And let me draw in the
lines that I just erased.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.650
So just to be clear, we
had a line over there,

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:46.280
and we also had this
right over here.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.730
And this was
straight up and down,

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.950
and these were
straight side to side.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.900
Now, so I moved this
part over down here.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.180
So I moved that over down there.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.070
And now I'm going to move
this top right triangle down

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.050
to the bottom left.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.570
So I'm just rearranging
the exact same area.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.290
So actually let me just
capture the whole thing

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.660
as best as I can.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.850
So let me cut and
then let me paste.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.764
And I'm going to move
it right over here.

00:06:21.764 --> 00:06:23.180
While I went through
that process,

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.510
I kind of lost its floor,
so let me redraw the floor.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.220
So I just moved it
right over here.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.660
So this thing,
this triangle-- let

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:37.280
me color it in-- is
now right over there.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:46.320
And this triangle is
now right over here.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:54.130
That center square, it is a
square, is now right over here.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.960
So hopefully you can appreciate
how we rearranged it.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.580
Now my question for
you is, how can we

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.470
express the area of
this new figure, which

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.220
has the exact same
area as the old figure?

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.160
I just shifted
parts of it around.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.030
How can we express this in
terms of the a's and b's?

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.640
Well, the key insight
here is to recognize

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.840
the length of this bottom side.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.970
What's the length of this
bottom side right over here?

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.930
The length of this bottom
side-- well this length right

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.450
over here is b, this length
right over here is a.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:31.590
So the length of this
entire bottom is a plus b.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.970
Well that by itself is
kind of interesting.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:41.369
But what we can realize is that
this length right over here,

00:07:41.369 --> 00:07:43.660
which is the exact same thing
as this length over here,

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.560
was also a.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.785
So we can construct
an a by a square.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.310
So this square right
over here is a by a,

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.110
and so it has area, a squared.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.820
Let me do that in a color
that you can actually see.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.710
So this has area of a squared.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:06.790
And then what's the area
of what's left over?

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:12.410
Well if this is length, a, then
this is length, a, as well.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.340
If this entire
bottom is a plus b,

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.920
then we know that
what's left over

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.369
after subtracting
the a out has to b.

00:08:20.369 --> 00:08:21.910
If this whole thing
is a plus b, this

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:24.830
is a, then this
right over here is b.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:29.060
And so the rest of this
newly oriented figure,

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:33.690
this new figure, everything
that I'm shading in over here,

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:36.809
this is just a b by b square.

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:39.130
So the area here is b squared.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:40.950
So the entire area
of this figure

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:45.150
is a squared plus b
squared, which lucky for us,

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.930
is equal to the area of this
expressed in terms of c because

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.250
of the exact same
figure, just rearranged.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.045
So it's going to be
equal to c squared.

00:08:54.045 --> 00:08:57.110
And it all worked out,
and Bhaskara gave us

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:02.320
a very cool proof of
the Pythagorean theorem.
