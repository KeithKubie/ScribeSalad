00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.934
[applause]

00:00:16.734 --> 00:00:20.467
Pausch: MAKE ME EARN IT.

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:21.467
IT'S A--

00:00:21.467 --> 00:00:23.767
man: YOU DID.

00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:26.234
Pausch: IT'S WONDERFUL
TO BE HERE.

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:28.434
WHAT INDIRA DIDN'T TELL YOU
IS THAT THIS LECTURE SERIES

00:00:28.434 --> 00:00:30.400
USED TO BE CALLED
"THE LAST LECTURE."

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.801
IF YOU HAD ONE LAST LECTURE
TO GIVE BEFORE YOU DIED,

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:34.100
WHAT WOULD IT BE?

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.968
I THOUGHT, "DAMN,
I FINALLY NAILED THE VENUE,

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:37.801
AND THEY RENAMED IT."

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:42.133
SO, YOU KNOW, IN CASE THERE'S
ANYBODY WHO WANDERED IN

00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.501
AND DOESN'T KNOW
THE BACKSTORY,

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:44.868
MY DAD ALWAYS TAUGHT ME,

00:00:44.868 --> 00:00:47.000
WHEN THERE'S AN ELEPHANT
IN THE ROOM, INTRODUCE THEM.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.434
IF YOU LOOK AT MY CAT SCANS,

00:00:49.434 --> 00:00:51.567
THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY
TEN TUMORS IN MY LIVER,

00:00:51.567 --> 00:00:53.033
AND THE DOCTORS TOLD ME

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:55.000
THREE TO SIX MONTHS
OF GOOD HEALTH LEFT.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.267
THAT WAS A MONTH AGO,
SO YOU CAN DO THE MATH.

00:00:58.267 --> 00:01:01.667
I HAVE SOME OF THE BEST DOCTORS
IN THE WORLD.

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:03.100
SO THAT IS WHAT IT IS.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.200
WE CAN'T CHANGE IT,
AND WE JUST HAVE TO DECIDE

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.601
HOW WE'RE GOING TO RESPOND
TO THAT.

00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:08.434
WE CANNOT CHANGE THE CARDS
WE ARE DEALT,

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:10.601
JUST HOW WE PLAY THE HAND.

00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:14.434
IF I DON'T SEEM AS DEPRESSED
OR MOROSE AS I SHOULD BE,

00:01:14.434 --> 00:01:15.701
SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU.

00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:18.467
[laughter]

00:01:18.467 --> 00:01:20.634
AND I ASSURE YOU,
I AM NOT IN DENIAL.

00:01:20.634 --> 00:01:22.667
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M NOT AWARE
OF WHAT'S GOING ON.

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:26.033
MY FAMILY, MY THREE KIDS,
MY WIFE, WE JUST DECAMPED.

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:28.801
WE BOUGHT A LOVELY HOUSE
IN CHESAPEAKE, VIRGINIA,

00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:30.200
NEAR NORFOLK,
AND WE'RE DOING THAT

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.367
BECAUSE THAT'S A BETTER PLACE

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:33.734
FOR THE FAMILY TO BE,
DOWN THE ROAD.

00:01:33.734 --> 00:01:34.901
AND THE OTHER THING IS

00:01:34.901 --> 00:01:36.667
I AM IN PHENOMENALLY GOOD HEALTH
RIGHT NOW.

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:37.968
I MEAN, IT'S THE GREATEST THING

00:01:37.968 --> 00:01:40.367
OF COGNITIVE DISSONANCE
YOU WILL EVER SEE

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:42.934
IS THE FACT THAT I AM
IN REALLY GOOD SHAPE.

00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:47.000
IN FACT, I'M IN BETTER SHAPE
THAN MOST OF YOU.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.934
[applause]

00:01:58.434 --> 00:02:00.334
SO ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO CRY
OR PITY ME

00:02:00.334 --> 00:02:01.934
CAN COME DOWN
AND DO A FEW OF THOSE,

00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:03.501
AND THEN YOU MAY PITY ME.

00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:05.367
[laughter]

00:02:05.367 --> 00:02:07.400
ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT WE'RE
NOT TALKING ABOUT TODAY,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.334
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT CANCER,

00:02:09.334 --> 00:02:11.234
BECAUSE I SPENT A LOT OF TIME
TALKING ABOUT THAT,

00:02:11.234 --> 00:02:12.567
AND I'M REALLY NOT INTERESTED.

00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:14.400
IF YOU HAVE ANY HERBAL
SUPPLEMENTS OR REMEDIES,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.534
PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM ME.

00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:17.067
[laughter]

00:02:17.067 --> 00:02:18.634
AND WE'RE NOT GOING
TO TALK ABOUT THINGS

00:02:18.634 --> 00:02:19.767
THAT ARE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT

00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:21.467
THAN ACHIEVING
YOUR CHILDHOOD DREAMS.

00:02:21.467 --> 00:02:22.934
WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK
ABOUT MY WIFE.

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:24.868
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT MY KIDS,
BECAUSE I'M GOOD,

00:02:24.868 --> 00:02:25.968
BUT I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH

00:02:25.968 --> 00:02:27.501
TO TALK ABOUT THAT
WITHOUT TEARING UP.

00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:29.267
SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE THAT
OFF THE TABLE.

00:02:29.267 --> 00:02:31.367
THAT'S MUCH MORE IMPORTANT.

00:02:31.367 --> 00:02:34.067
AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK
ABOUT SPIRITUALITY AND RELIGION.

00:02:34.067 --> 00:02:35.968
ALTHOUGH I WILL TELL YOU
THAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED

00:02:35.968 --> 00:02:38.267
A DEATHBED CONVERSION.

00:02:38.267 --> 00:02:39.868
I JUST BOUGHT A MACINTOSH.

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:42.801
[applause]

00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:53.300
NOW, I KNEW I'D GET 9%
OF THE AUDIENCE WITH THAT.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.501
ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT IS TODAY'S
TALK ABOUT THEN?

00:02:55.501 --> 00:02:59.534
IT'S ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD DREAMS
AND HOW I HAVE ACHIEVED THEM--

00:02:59.534 --> 00:03:01.434
I'VE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE
THAT WAY--

00:03:01.434 --> 00:03:03.601
HOW I BELIEVE I'VE BEEN ABLE
TO ENABLE THE DREAMS--

00:03:03.601 --> 00:03:06.634
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO ENABLE
THE DREAMS OF OTHERS,

00:03:06.634 --> 00:03:08.834
AND TO SOME DEGREE,
LESSONS LEARNED--

00:03:08.834 --> 00:03:09.968
I'M A PROFESSOR;

00:03:09.968 --> 00:03:12.100
THERE SHOULD BE
SOME LESSONS LEARNED--

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.767
AND HOW YOU CAN USE THE STUFF
YOU HEAR TODAY

00:03:14.767 --> 00:03:17.501
TO ACHIEVE YOUR DREAMS
OR ENABLE THE DREAMS OF OTHERS.

00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:19.000
AND AS YOU GET OLDER,
YOU MAY FIND

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.701
THAT ENABLING THE DREAMS
OF OTHERS THING

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:22.901
IS EVEN MORE FUN.

00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:24.834
SO WHAT WERE
MY CHILDHOOD DREAMS?

00:03:24.834 --> 00:03:27.300
WELL, YOU KNOW, I HAD
A REALLY GOOD CHILDHOOD,

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.834
I MEAN, NO KIDDING AROUND.

00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:31.234
I WAS GOING BACK THROUGH
THE FAMILY ARCHIVES,

00:03:31.234 --> 00:03:33.067
AND WHAT
WAS REALLY AMAZING WAS,

00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:35.100
I COULDN'T FIND ANY PICTURES
OF ME AS A KID

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.467
WHERE I WASN'T SMILING,
ALL RIGHT?

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:42.834
AND THAT WAS JUST
A VERY GRATIFYING THING.

00:03:42.834 --> 00:03:45.400
THERE WAS OUR DOG, RIGHT?

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.934
AW, THANK YOU.

00:03:47.934 --> 00:03:50.901
AND THERE I ACTUALLY
HAVE A PICTURE OF ME DREAMING.

00:03:50.901 --> 00:03:53.133
[laughter]

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:54.534
AND I DID A LOT OF THAT.

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:58.100
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A LOT
OF "WAKE UPS," YOU KNOW?

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.267
AND IT WAS AN EASY TIME
TO DREAM.

00:04:01.267 --> 00:04:05.100
I WAS BORN IN 1960,
ALL RIGHT?

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.968
WHEN YOU'RE EIGHT
OR NINE YEARS OLD

00:04:06.968 --> 00:04:09.767
AND YOU LOOK AT THE TV SET
AND MEN ARE LANDING ON THE MOON,

00:04:09.767 --> 00:04:11.834
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE,

00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:15.200
AND THAT'S SOMETHING
WE SHOULD NOT LOSE SIGHT OF,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.567
IS THAT THE INSPIRATION

00:04:16.567 --> 00:04:20.267
AND THE PERMISSION TO DREAM
IS HUGE.

00:04:20.267 --> 00:04:22.200
SO WHAT WERE
MY CHILDHOOD DREAMS?

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.934
YOU MAY NOT AGREE
WITH THIS LIST, BUT I WAS THERE.

00:04:24.934 --> 00:04:26.734
[laughter]

00:04:26.734 --> 00:04:28.133
BEING IN ZERO GRAVITY,

00:04:28.133 --> 00:04:29.901
PLAYING IN THE NATIONAL
FOOTBALL LEAGUE,

00:04:29.901 --> 00:04:32.634
AUTHORING AN ARTICLE IN
THE "WORLD BOOK" ENCYCLOPEDIA--

00:04:32.634 --> 00:04:34.400
I GUESS YOU CAN TELL
THE NERDS EARLY--

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.868
[laughter]

00:04:35.868 --> 00:04:37.634
BEING CAPTAIN KIRK.

00:04:37.634 --> 00:04:40.434
ANYBODY HERE
HAVE THAT CHILDHOOD DREAM?

00:04:40.434 --> 00:04:42.667
NOT AT CMU, NO.

00:04:42.667 --> 00:04:44.334
I WANTED TO BECOME
ONE OF THE GUYS

00:04:44.334 --> 00:04:46.501
WHO WON THE BIG STUFFED ANIMALS
IN THE AMUSEMENT PARK,

00:04:46.501 --> 00:04:48.801
AND I WANTED TO BE
AN IMAGINEER WITH DISNEY.

00:04:48.801 --> 00:04:50.634
THESE ARE NOT SORTED
IN ANY PARTICULAR ORDER,

00:04:50.634 --> 00:04:52.501
ALTHOUGH I THINK
THEY DO GET HARDER,

00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:54.801
EXCEPT FOR MAYBE THE FIRST ONE.

00:04:54.801 --> 00:04:56.734
OKAY SO BEING IN ZERO GRAVITY.

00:04:56.734 --> 00:04:58.534
NOW, IT'S IMPORTANT
TO HAVE SPECIFIC DREAMS.

00:04:58.534 --> 00:05:00.000
I DID NOT DREAM OF BEING
AN ASTRONAUT,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.868
BECAUSE WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID,
I WORE GLASSES,

00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:03.934
AND THEY TOLD ME "OH, ASTRONAUTS
CAN'T HAVE GLASSES."

00:05:03.934 --> 00:05:05.467
AND I WAS LIKE, "MM, I DIDN'T
REALLY WANT

00:05:05.467 --> 00:05:08.067
THE WHOLE ASTRONAUT GIG;
I JUST WANTED THE FLOATING."

00:05:08.067 --> 00:05:10.501
SO--AND AS A CHILD--

00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:14.167
[laughter]

00:05:14.167 --> 00:05:17.300
PROTOTYPE 0.0.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.567
BUT THAT DIDN'T WORK SO WELL,
AND IT TURNS OUT THAT NASA

00:05:21.567 --> 00:05:24.367
HAS SOMETHING CALLED
THE VOMIT COMET

00:05:24.367 --> 00:05:25.934
THAT THEY USE TO TRAIN
THE ASTRONAUTS,

00:05:25.934 --> 00:05:28.634
AND THIS THING DOES
PARABOLIC ARCS,

00:05:28.634 --> 00:05:29.968
AND AT THE TOP OF EACH ARC,

00:05:29.968 --> 00:05:31.868
YOU GET ABOUT 25 SECONDS
WHERE YOU'RE BALLISTIC

00:05:31.868 --> 00:05:35.000
AND YOU GET ABOUT A ROUGH
EQUIVALENT OF WEIGHTLESSNESS

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.200
FOR ABOUT 25 SECONDS.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.300
AND THERE IS A PROGRAM
WHERE COLLEGE STUDENTS

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.534
CAN SUBMIT PROPOSALS,

00:05:41.534 --> 00:05:45.734
AND IF THEY WIN THE COMPETITION,
THEY GET TO FLY,

00:05:45.734 --> 00:05:47.234
AND I THOUGHT
THAT WAS REALLY COOL,

00:05:47.234 --> 00:05:48.934
AND WE HAD A TEAM,
AND WE PUT A TEAM TOGETHER,

00:05:48.934 --> 00:05:50.434
AND THEY WON,
AND THEY GOT TO FLY,

00:05:50.434 --> 00:05:53.667
AND I WAS ALL EXCITED BECAUSE
I WAS GOING TO GO WITH THEM...

00:05:53.667 --> 00:05:55.767
AND THEN I HIT
THE FIRST BRICK WALL,

00:05:55.767 --> 00:05:57.300
BECAUSE THEY MADE IT
VERY CLEAR

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.934
THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
WERE FACULTY MEMBERS

00:06:00.934 --> 00:06:03.200
ALLOWED TO FLY
WITH THE TEAMS.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.968
I KNOW.
I WAS HEARTBROKEN, RIGHT.

00:06:05.968 --> 00:06:10.634
I WAS LIKE, "BUT I WORKED
SO HARD."

00:06:10.634 --> 00:06:13.667
AND SO I READ THE LITERATURE
VERY CAREFULLY,

00:06:13.667 --> 00:06:15.467
AND IT TURNS OUT THAT NASA--

00:06:15.467 --> 00:06:18.167
IT'S PART OF THEIR OUTREACH
AND PUBLICITY PROGRAM,

00:06:18.167 --> 00:06:20.601
AND IT TURNS OUT
THAT THE STUDENTS WERE ALLOWED

00:06:20.601 --> 00:06:24.234
TO BRING A LOCAL MEDIA
JOURNALIST FROM THEIR HOMETOWN.

00:06:24.234 --> 00:06:27.133
[laughter]

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:35.200
RANDY PAUSCH, WEB JOURNALIST.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.734
IT'S REALLY EASY
TO GET A PRESS PASS.

00:06:36.734 --> 00:06:40.100
SO I CALLED UP THE GUYS AT NASA,
AND I SAID,

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.934
"I NEED TO KNOW
WHERE TO FAX SOME DOCUMENTS."

00:06:41.934 --> 00:06:44.234
AND THEY SAID, "WHAT DOCUMENTS
ARE YOU GOING TO FAX US?"

00:06:44.234 --> 00:06:46.667
I SAID, "MY RESIGNATION
AS THE FACULTY ADVISOR

00:06:46.667 --> 00:06:50.734
AND MY APPLICATION
AS THE JOURNALIST."

00:06:50.734 --> 00:06:55.567
AND HE SAID, "THAT'S A LITTLE
TRANSPARENT, DON'T YOU THINK?"

00:06:55.567 --> 00:06:58.200
AND I SAID, "YEAH, BUT OUR
PROJECT IS VIRTUAL REALITY,

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.300
"AND WE'RE GOING TO BRING DOWN
A WHOLE BUNCH OF VR HEADSETS,

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.300
"AND ALL THE STUDENTS
FROM ALL THE TEAMS

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.467
"ARE GOING TO EXPERIENCE IT

00:07:04.467 --> 00:07:06.067
"AND ALL THOSE OTHER
REAL JOURNALISTS

00:07:06.067 --> 00:07:09.334
ARE GOING TO GET TO FILM IT."

00:07:09.334 --> 00:07:13.000
JIM FOLEY'S GOING,
"OH, YOU BASTARD, YES."

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.934
AND THE GUY SAID,
"HERE'S THE FAX NUMBER."

00:07:15.934 --> 00:07:18.434
SO--AND INDEED, WE KEPT
OUR END OF THE BARGAIN,

00:07:18.434 --> 00:07:20.133
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THEMES
THAT YOU'LL HEAR

00:07:20.133 --> 00:07:21.400
LATER ON IN THE TALK

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.334
IS HAVE SOMETHING TO BRING
TO THE TABLE, RIGHT,

00:07:23.334 --> 00:07:26.133
BECAUSE THAT WILL MAKE YOU
MORE WELCOMED.

00:07:26.133 --> 00:07:29.968
AND IF YOU'RE CURIOUS ABOUT
WHAT ZERO GRAVITY LOOKS LIKE,

00:07:29.968 --> 00:07:33.501
HOPEFULLY THE SOUND
WILL BE WORKING HERE.

00:07:36.367 --> 00:07:37.567
man: IT'S ON.

00:07:37.567 --> 00:07:40.834
woman: ALL RIGHT,
GO GET 'EM, MAZI.

00:07:40.834 --> 00:07:42.968
THIS IS FANTASTIC.

00:07:42.968 --> 00:07:44.200
IT'S JUST AMAZING.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.234
IT'S NOTHING LIKE I EXPECTED.

00:07:47.234 --> 00:07:48.601
Pausch: THERE I AM.

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:51.868
[laughter]

00:07:51.868 --> 00:07:54.234
woman: THIS IS AWESOME.

00:07:54.234 --> 00:07:57.467
[laughs]

00:07:57.467 --> 00:07:58.701
YOU GOT ONE, MAZI.

00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:00.100
THAT'S GOOD.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.767
man: GOT A BALL FOR YOU, MAZ.

00:08:01.767 --> 00:08:04.234
[laughter]

00:08:04.234 --> 00:08:09.300
Pausch: YOU DO PAY THE PIPER
AT THE BOTTOM.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.400
SO CHILDHOOD DREAM NUMBER ONE,
CHECK.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.000
ALL RIGHT, LET'S TALK
ABOUT FOOTBALL.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.834
MY DREAM WAS TO PLAY
IN THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE,

00:08:17.834 --> 00:08:20.601
AND MOST OF YOU DON'T KNOW
THAT I ACTUALLY PLAYED--NO.

00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:22.901
[laughter]

00:08:22.901 --> 00:08:25.033
NO, I DID NOT MAKE IT
TO THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE,

00:08:25.033 --> 00:08:29.100
BUT I PROBABLY GOT MORE
FROM THAT DREAM

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.801
AND NOT ACCOMPLISHING IT

00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:34.767
THAN I GOT FROM ANY OF THE ONES
THAT I DID ACCOMPLISH.

00:08:34.767 --> 00:08:36.067
I HAD A COACH.

00:08:36.067 --> 00:08:37.501
I SIGNED UP WHEN
I WAS NINE YEARS OLD.

00:08:37.501 --> 00:08:40.801
I WAS THE SMALLEST KID
IN THE LEAGUE BY FAR,

00:08:40.801 --> 00:08:43.367
AND I HAD A COACH, JIM GRAHAM,
WHO WAS 6'4".

00:08:43.367 --> 00:08:45.601
HE HAD PLAYED LINEBACKER
AT PENN STATE.

00:08:45.601 --> 00:08:49.000
HE WAS JUST THIS HULK OF A GUY,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.033
AND HE WAS OLD SCHOOL,
I MEAN, REALLY OLD SCHOOL.

00:08:52.033 --> 00:08:54.267
LIKE, HE THOUGHT THE
FORWARD PASS WAS A TRICK PLAY.

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:56.567
[laughter]

00:08:56.567 --> 00:08:58.601
AND HE SHOWED UP FOR PRACTICE
THE FIRST DAY,

00:08:58.601 --> 00:09:00.601
AND, YOU KNOW,
HE'S THIS BIG HULKING GUY.

00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:02.067
WE WERE ALL SCARED
TO DEATH OF HIM,

00:09:02.067 --> 00:09:05.067
AND HE HADN'T BROUGHT
ANY FOOTBALLS.

00:09:05.067 --> 00:09:08.534
HOW ARE WE GOING TO HAVE
PRACTICE WITHOUT ANY FOOTBALLS?

00:09:08.534 --> 00:09:10.534
AND ONE OF THE OTHER KIDS SAID,

00:09:10.534 --> 00:09:13.100
"EXCUSE ME, COACH,
BUT THERE'S NO FOOTBALL."

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.000
AND COACH GRAHAM SAID,
"RIGHT, HOW MANY MEN

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.667
ARE ON A FOOTBALL FIELD
AT A TIME?"

00:09:16.667 --> 00:09:18.634
"11 ON A TEAM, 22."

00:09:18.634 --> 00:09:20.200
AND COACH GRAHAM SAID,

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.667
"ALL RIGHT, AND HOW MANY PEOPLE

00:09:21.667 --> 00:09:23.601
ARE TOUCHING THE FOOTBALL
AT ANY GIVEN TIME?"

00:09:23.601 --> 00:09:24.868
"ONE OF THEM."

00:09:24.868 --> 00:09:26.567
AND HE SAID, "RIGHT,
SO WE'RE GOING TO WORK

00:09:26.567 --> 00:09:29.334
ON WHAT THOSE OTHER 21 GUYS
ARE DOING."

00:09:29.334 --> 00:09:31.667
AND THAT'S A REALLY GOOD STORY,

00:09:31.667 --> 00:09:33.901
BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT
FUNDAMENTALS, FUNDAMENTALS,

00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:35.300
FUNDAMENTALS, FUNDAMENTALS.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.901
YOU'VE GOT TO GET
THE FUNDAMENTALS DOWN,

00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:39.067
BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE FANCY
STUFF ISN'T GOING TO WORK.

00:09:39.067 --> 00:09:40.968
AND THE OTHER JIM GRAHAM STORY
I HAVE IS,

00:09:40.968 --> 00:09:42.067
THERE WAS ONE PRACTICE

00:09:42.067 --> 00:09:43.734
WHERE HE JUST RODE ME
ALL PRACTICE.

00:09:43.734 --> 00:09:45.934
JUST, "YOU'RE DOING THIS WRONG.
YOU'RE DOING THIS WRONG.

00:09:45.934 --> 00:09:47.334
"GO BACK AND DO IT AGAIN.
YOU OWE ME.

00:09:47.334 --> 00:09:48.934
YOU'RE DOING PUSH-UPS
AFTER PRACTICE."

00:09:48.934 --> 00:09:50.300
AND WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER,

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.467
ONE OF THE OTHER ASSISTANT
COACHES CAME OVER AND SAID,

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:54.634
"YEAH, COACH GRAHAM RODE YOU
PRETTY HARD, DIDN'T HE?"

00:09:54.634 --> 00:09:55.667
I SAID, "YEAH."

00:09:55.667 --> 00:09:56.868
HE SAID, "THAT'S A GOOD THING."

00:09:56.868 --> 00:09:58.834
HE SAID, "WHEN YOU'RE
SCREWING UP

00:09:58.834 --> 00:10:01.334
"AND NOBODY'S SAYING ANYTHING
TO YOU ANYMORE,

00:10:01.334 --> 00:10:05.000
THAT MEANS THEY GAVE UP."

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.100
AND THAT'S A LESSON THAT STUCK
WITH ME MY WHOLE LIFE

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.968
IS THAT WHEN YOU SEE YOURSELF
DOING SOMETHING BADLY

00:10:09.968 --> 00:10:12.033
AND NOBODY'S BOTHERING
TO TELL YOU ANYMORE,

00:10:12.033 --> 00:10:13.868
THAT'S A VERY BAD PLACE TO BE.

00:10:13.868 --> 00:10:15.534
YOUR CRITICS ARE YOUR ONES
TELLING YOU

00:10:15.534 --> 00:10:17.300
THEY STILL LOVE YOU AND CARE.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.968
AFTER COACH GRAHAM,
I HAD ANOTHER COACH,

00:10:18.968 --> 00:10:20.267
COACH SETLIFF,

00:10:20.267 --> 00:10:22.367
AND HE TAUGHT ME A LOT ABOUT
THE POWER OF ENTHUSIASM.

00:10:22.367 --> 00:10:25.000
HE DID THIS ONE THING WHERE
ONLY FOR ONE PLAY AT A TIME,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.434
HE WOULD PUT PEOPLE IN
AT, LIKE,

00:10:26.434 --> 00:10:29.801
THE MOST HORRIFICALLY WRONG
POSITION FOR THEM.

00:10:29.801 --> 00:10:33.300
LIKE, ALL THE SHORT GUYS
WOULD BECOME RECEIVERS, RIGHT?

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.601
IT WAS JUST LAUGHABLE.

00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:37.667
BUT WE ONLY WENT IN
FOR ONE PLAY, RIGHT?

00:10:37.667 --> 00:10:40.601
AND, BOY, THE OTHER TEAM
JUST NEVER KNEW WHAT HIT 'EM,

00:10:40.601 --> 00:10:42.534
BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE
ONLY DOING IT FOR ONE PLAY

00:10:42.534 --> 00:10:44.367
AND YOU'RE JUST NOT WHERE
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

00:10:44.367 --> 00:10:46.567
AND FREEDOM'S JUST ANOTHER WORD
FOR NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE,

00:10:46.567 --> 00:10:48.334
BOY, ARE YOU GOING
TO CLEAN SOMEBODY'S CLOCK

00:10:48.334 --> 00:10:49.901
FOR THAT ONE PLAY.

00:10:49.901 --> 00:10:51.667
AND THAT KIND OF ENTHUSIASM
WAS GREAT,

00:10:51.667 --> 00:10:54.601
AND TO THIS DAY, I AM MOST
COMFORTABLE ON A FOOTBALL FIELD.

00:10:54.601 --> 00:10:56.634
I MEAN, IT'S JUST ONE
OF THOSE THINGS WHERE,

00:10:56.634 --> 00:10:58.467
YOU KNOW, IF I'M WORKING
A HARD PROBLEM,

00:10:58.467 --> 00:11:00.167
PEOPLE WILL SEE ME WANDERING
THE HALLS

00:11:00.167 --> 00:11:02.567
WITH ONE OF THESE THINGS,
AND THAT'S JUST BECAUSE,

00:11:02.567 --> 00:11:04.434
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING
YOUNG ENOUGH

00:11:04.434 --> 00:11:05.667
AND YOU TRAIN FOR IT,

00:11:05.667 --> 00:11:07.067
IT JUST BECOMES
A PART OF YOU,

00:11:07.067 --> 00:11:09.801
AND I'M VERY GLAD THAT FOOTBALL
WAS A PART OF MY LIFE,

00:11:09.801 --> 00:11:11.901
AND IF I DIDN'T GET THE DREAM
OF PLAYING IN THE NFL,

00:11:11.901 --> 00:11:13.067
THAT'S OKAY.

00:11:13.067 --> 00:11:15.033
I PROBABLY GOT STUFF
MORE VALUABLE,

00:11:15.033 --> 00:11:17.100
BECAUSE LOOKING AT WHAT'S
GOING ON IN THE NFL,

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.100
I'M NOT SURE THOSE GUYS
ARE DOING SO GREAT RIGHT NOW.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.501
OKAY.

00:11:21.501 --> 00:11:23.000
AND SO ONE OF THE EXPRESSIONS

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.667
I LEARNED AT ELECTRONIC ARTS,
WHICH I LOVE,

00:11:24.667 --> 00:11:26.834
WHICH PERTAINS TO THIS IS,
"EXPERIENCE IS WHAT YOU GET

00:11:26.834 --> 00:11:29.167
WHEN YOU DIDN'T GET
WHAT YOU WANTED."

00:11:29.167 --> 00:11:32.033
AND I THINK THAT'S
ABSOLUTELY LOVELY.

00:11:32.033 --> 00:11:33.901
AND THE OTHER THING
ABOUT FOOTBALL IS,

00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:36.434
WE SEND OUR KIDS OUT
TO PLAY FOOTBALL OR SOCCER

00:11:36.434 --> 00:11:37.968
OR SWIMMING OR WHATEVER IT IS,

00:11:37.968 --> 00:11:40.000
AND IT'S THE FIRST EXAMPLE
OF WHAT I'M GOING TO CALL

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.501
A HEAD FAKE
OR INDIRECT LEARNING.

00:11:41.501 --> 00:11:43.434
WE ACTUALLY DON'T WANT OUR KIDS
TO LEARN FOOTBALL.

00:11:43.434 --> 00:11:44.601
I MEAN, YEAH, IT'S REALLY NICE

00:11:44.601 --> 00:11:46.267
THAT I HAVE A WONDERFUL
THREE-POINT STANCE

00:11:46.267 --> 00:11:47.667
AND THAT I KNOW HOW TO DO
A CHOP BLOCK

00:11:47.667 --> 00:11:48.667
AND ALL THIS KIND OF STUFF.

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:50.100
BUT WE SEND OUR KIDS
OUT TO LEARN

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.901
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THINGS:

00:11:51.901 --> 00:11:54.601
TEAMWORK, SPORTSMANSHIP,
PERSEVERANCE, ET CETERA,

00:11:54.601 --> 00:11:55.801
ET CETERA.

00:11:55.801 --> 00:11:58.100
AND THESE KINDS
OF HEAD FAKE LEARNINGS

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.801
ARE ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT,

00:12:00.801 --> 00:12:02.467
AND YOU SHOULD KEEP
YOUR EYE OUT FOR THEM,

00:12:02.467 --> 00:12:04.000
BECAUSE THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.400
ALL RIGHT, A SIMPLE ONE,

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.634
BEING AN AUTHOR IN
THE "WORLD BOOK" ENCYCLOPEDIA.

00:12:07.634 --> 00:12:08.968
WHEN I WAS A KID,

00:12:08.968 --> 00:12:11.033
WE HAD THE "WORLD BOOK"
ENCYCLOPEDIA ON THE SHELF.

00:12:11.033 --> 00:12:12.968
FOR THE FRESHMEN,
THIS IS PAPER.

00:12:12.968 --> 00:12:15.934
[laughter]

00:12:15.934 --> 00:12:20.868
WE USED TO HAVE THESE THINGS
CALLED BOOKS.

00:12:20.868 --> 00:12:23.467
AND AFTER I HAD BECOME SOMEWHAT
OF AN AUTHORITY

00:12:23.467 --> 00:12:24.868
ON VIRTUAL REALITY,
BUT NOT, LIKE,

00:12:24.868 --> 00:12:26.300
A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE--

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.767
SO I WAS AT THE LEVEL OF PEOPLE
THE "WORLD BOOK" WOULD BADGER--

00:12:29.767 --> 00:12:31.400
THEY CALLED ME UP,
AND I WROTE AN ARTICLE,

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.000
AND THIS IS CAITLIN KELLEHER.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.868
AND THERE'S AN ARTICLE IF YOU GO
TO YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY

00:12:35.868 --> 00:12:37.968
WHERE THEY STILL HAVE COPIES
OF THE "WORLD BOOK."

00:12:37.968 --> 00:12:39.534
LOOK UNDER "V"
FOR VIRTUAL REALITY,

00:12:39.534 --> 00:12:40.534
AND THERE IT IS.

00:12:40.534 --> 00:12:43.000
AND ALL I HAVE TO SAY
IS THAT,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.767
HAVING BEEN SELECTED
TO BE AN AUTHOR

00:12:44.767 --> 00:12:46.601
IN THE "WORLD BOOK"
ENCYCLOPEDIA,

00:12:46.601 --> 00:12:49.767
I NOW BELIEVE THAT WIKIPEDIA
IS A PERFECTLY FINE SOURCE

00:12:49.767 --> 00:12:50.968
FOR YOUR INFORMATION

00:12:50.968 --> 00:12:52.901
BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT
THE QUALITY CONTROL IS

00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:54.267
FOR REAL ENCYCLOPEDIAS.

00:12:54.267 --> 00:12:56.834
THEY LET ME IN.

00:12:56.834 --> 00:12:58.868
ALL RIGHT, NEXT ONE.

00:12:58.868 --> 00:13:01.868
[laughter]

00:13:04.167 --> 00:13:05.634
AT A CERTAIN POINT,
YOU JUST REALIZE

00:13:05.634 --> 00:13:07.367
THERE ARE SOME THINGS
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DO,

00:13:07.367 --> 00:13:10.400
SO MAYBE YOU JUST WANT TO STAND
CLOSE TO THE PEOPLE.

00:13:14.801 --> 00:13:20.267
I MEAN, MY GOD, WHAT
A ROLE MODEL FOR YOUNG PEOPLE.

00:13:20.267 --> 00:13:22.801
I MEAN, THIS IS EVERYTHING
YOU WANT TO BE,

00:13:22.801 --> 00:13:24.801
AND WHAT I LEARNED
THAT CARRIED ME FORWARD

00:13:24.801 --> 00:13:26.200
IN LEADERSHIP LATER IS THAT,

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.033
YOU KNOW, HE WASN'T THE SMARTEST
GUY ON THE SHIP.

00:13:28.033 --> 00:13:29.501
I MEAN, SPOCK WAS PRETTY SMART,

00:13:29.501 --> 00:13:32.067
AND MCCOY WAS THE DOCTOR,
AND SCOTTY WAS THE ENGINEER,

00:13:32.067 --> 00:13:34.601
AND YOU SORT OF GO,
"AND WHAT SKILL SET DID HE HAVE

00:13:34.601 --> 00:13:36.934
TO GET ON THIS DAMN THING
AND RUN IT?"

00:13:36.934 --> 00:13:38.367
AND, YOU KNOW,
CLEARLY THERE IS

00:13:38.367 --> 00:13:40.033
THIS SKILL SET CALLED
LEADERSHIP,

00:13:40.033 --> 00:13:42.334
AND, YOU KNOW, WHETHER OR NOT
YOU LIKE THE SERIES,

00:13:42.334 --> 00:13:44.467
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THERE WAS
A LOT TO BE LEARNED

00:13:44.467 --> 00:13:48.467
ABOUT HOW TO LEAD PEOPLE
BY WATCHING THIS GUY IN ACTION,

00:13:48.467 --> 00:13:52.901
AND HE JUST HAD THE COOLEST
DAMN TOYS.

00:13:52.901 --> 00:13:56.968
I MEAN, MY GOD, HE, YOU KNOW--

00:13:56.968 --> 00:13:58.601
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS
FASCINATING AS A KID

00:13:58.601 --> 00:14:00.767
THAT HE HAD THIS THING
AND HE COULD,

00:14:00.767 --> 00:14:02.567
YOU KNOW, TALK TO THE SHIP
WITH IT.

00:14:02.567 --> 00:14:04.934
[electronic beeping]

00:14:04.934 --> 00:14:06.801
I JUST THOUGHT
THAT WAS JUST SPECTACULAR,

00:14:06.801 --> 00:14:12.234
AND OF COURSE NOW I OWN ONE,
AND IT'S SMALLER.

00:14:12.234 --> 00:14:15.834
SO THAT'S KIND OF COOL.

00:14:15.834 --> 00:14:21.067
SO I GOT TO ACHIEVE THIS DREAM.

00:14:21.067 --> 00:14:26.133
JAMES T. KIRK--HIS ALTER EGO
WILLIAM SHATNER WROTE A BOOK,

00:14:26.133 --> 00:14:28.167
WHICH I THINK WAS ACTUALLY
A PRETTY COOL BOOK.

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:29.534
IT WAS WITH CHIP WALTER,

00:14:29.534 --> 00:14:32.367
WHO IS A PITTSBURGH-BASED
AUTHOR WHO IS QUITE GOOD,

00:14:32.367 --> 00:14:34.067
AND THEY WROTE A BOOK
ON BASICALLY

00:14:34.067 --> 00:14:35.501
THE SCIENCE OF STAR TREK,
YOU KNOW,

00:14:35.501 --> 00:14:37.067
WHAT HAS COME TRUE,

00:14:37.067 --> 00:14:39.434
AND THEY WENT AROUND TO THE
TOP PLACES AROUND THE COUNTRY

00:14:39.434 --> 00:14:40.801
AND LOOKED AT VARIOUS THINGS,

00:14:40.801 --> 00:14:42.934
AND THEY CAME HERE TO STUDY
OUR VIRTUAL REALITY SETUP,

00:14:42.934 --> 00:14:45.567
AND SO WE BUILT
A VIRTUAL REALITY FOR HIM.

00:14:45.567 --> 00:14:47.400
IT LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.033
WE PUT IT IN,
PUT IT TO RED ALERT.

00:14:49.033 --> 00:14:50.367
HE WAS A VERY GOOD SPORT.

00:14:50.367 --> 00:14:55.334
IT'S NOT LIKE HE SAW
THAT ONE COMING.

00:14:55.334 --> 00:15:01.000
AND IT'S REALLY COOL
TO MEET YOUR BOYHOOD IDOL,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.834
BUT IT'S EVEN COOLER
WHEN HE COMES TO YOU

00:15:03.834 --> 00:15:08.234
TO SEE WHAT COOL STUFF
YOU'RE DOING IN YOUR LAB,

00:15:08.234 --> 00:15:11.133
AND THAT WAS JUST
A GREAT MOMENT.

00:15:11.133 --> 00:15:16.300
ALL RIGHT,
WINNING STUFFED ANIMALS.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.901
THIS MAY SEEM MUNDANE TO YOU,

00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:20.067
BUT WHEN YOU'RE A LITTLE KID
AND YOU SEE THE BIG BUFF GUYS

00:15:20.067 --> 00:15:21.501
WALKING AROUND
AN AMUSEMENT PARK

00:15:21.501 --> 00:15:23.634
AND THEY'VE GOT ALL THESE
BIG STUFFED ANIMALS, RIGHT?

00:15:23.634 --> 00:15:25.200
AND THIS IS MY LOVELY WIFE,

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.634
AND I HAVE A LOT OF PICTURES
OF STUFFED ANIMALS I'VE WON.

00:15:29.634 --> 00:15:33.767
THAT'S MY DAD POSING WITH ONE
THAT I WON.

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:36.267
I'VE WON A LOT OF THESE ANIMALS.

00:15:36.267 --> 00:15:37.601
THERE'S MY DAD.

00:15:37.601 --> 00:15:39.801
HE DID WIN THAT ONE
TO HIS CREDIT.

00:15:39.801 --> 00:15:42.734
[laughter]

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.467
RIGHT, AND THIS WAS JUST

00:15:48.467 --> 00:15:50.067
A BIG PART OF MY LIFE
AND MY FAMILY'S LIFE,

00:15:50.067 --> 00:15:52.234
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I CAN HEAR THE CYNICS.

00:15:52.234 --> 00:15:55.901
YOU KNOW, IN THIS AGE
OF DIGITALLY MANIPULATED THINGS,

00:15:55.901 --> 00:15:58.834
MAYBE THOSE BEARS REALLY AREN'T
IN THE PICTURES WITH ME,

00:15:58.834 --> 00:16:01.634
OR MAYBE I PAID SOMEBODY
FIVE BUCKS

00:16:01.634 --> 00:16:03.901
TO TAKE A PICTURE IN
THE THEME PARK NEXT TO THE BEAR.

00:16:03.901 --> 00:16:05.834
AND I SAID, "HOW, IN THIS AGE
OF CYNICISM,

00:16:05.834 --> 00:16:07.667
CAN I CONVINCE PEOPLE?"

00:16:07.667 --> 00:16:11.234
AND I SAID, "I KNOW.
I CAN SHOW THEM THE BEARS."

00:16:11.234 --> 00:16:16.067
BRING THEM OUT.

00:16:16.067 --> 00:16:19.968
[applause]

00:16:19.968 --> 00:16:22.200
IF YOU CAN JUST PUT 'EM
RIGHT THERE.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.701
JUST PUT THEM BACK
AGAINST THE WALL.

00:16:26.701 --> 00:16:30.968
woman: IT'S HARD TO HEAR YOU.

00:16:30.968 --> 00:16:35.501
Pausch: THANKS, HONEY.

00:16:35.501 --> 00:16:38.300
SO HERE ARE SOME BEARS.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.467
WE DIDN'T HAVE QUITE ENOUGH ROOM
IN THE MOVING TRUCK

00:16:40.467 --> 00:16:42.167
DOWN TO CHESAPEAKE,

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:44.701
AND ANYBODY WHO WOULD LIKE
A LITTLE PIECE OF ME

00:16:44.701 --> 00:16:47.234
AT THE END OF THIS,
FEEL FREE TO COME UP.

00:16:47.234 --> 00:16:50.067
FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE.

00:16:50.067 --> 00:16:53.734
ALL RIGHT, MY NEXT ONE,
BEING AN IMAGINEER.

00:16:53.734 --> 00:16:55.200
THIS WAS THE HARD ONE.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.100
BELIEVE ME,
GETTING TO ZERO GRAVITY

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.934
IS EASIER THAN BECOMING
AN IMAGINEER.

00:16:59.934 --> 00:17:02.934
WHEN I WAS A KID,
I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD

00:17:02.934 --> 00:17:04.734
AND OUR FAMILY TOOK
A TRIP CROSS-COUNTRY

00:17:04.734 --> 00:17:07.300
TO SEE DISNEYLAND, AND IF YOU'VE
EVER SEEN THE MOVIE

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:11.767
"NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION,"
IT WAS A LOT LIKE THAT.

00:17:11.767 --> 00:17:13.834
IT WAS A QUEST.

00:17:13.834 --> 00:17:17.801
AND THESE ARE REAL
VINTAGE PHOTOGRAPHS,

00:17:17.801 --> 00:17:20.868
AND THERE I AM

00:17:20.868 --> 00:17:23.133
IN FRONT OF THE CASTLE,
AND THERE I AM--

00:17:23.133 --> 00:17:25.133
AND FOR THOSE OF YOU
WHO ARE INTO FORESHADOWING,

00:17:25.133 --> 00:17:28.567
THIS IS THE ALICE RIDE.

00:17:28.567 --> 00:17:33.033
AND I JUST THOUGHT THIS WAS JUST
THE COOLEST ENVIRONMENT

00:17:33.033 --> 00:17:34.601
I HAD EVER BEEN IN,
AND INSTEAD OF SAYING,

00:17:34.601 --> 00:17:36.200
"GEE, I WANT
TO EXPERIENCE THIS," I SAID,

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.133
"I WANT TO MAKE STUFF
LIKE THIS."

00:17:38.133 --> 00:17:40.267
AND SO I BIDED MY TIME,

00:17:40.267 --> 00:17:41.667
AND THEN I GRADUATED
WITH MY PhD

00:17:41.667 --> 00:17:43.567
FROM CARNEGIE MELLON,
THINKING THAT MEANT ME

00:17:43.567 --> 00:17:45.167
INFINITELY QUALIFIED
TO DO ANYTHING,

00:17:45.167 --> 00:17:46.934
AND I DASHED OFF MY LETTERS
OF APPLICATION

00:17:46.934 --> 00:17:48.400
TO WALT DISNEY IMAGINEERING,

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.100
AND THEY SENT ME SOME OF THE
DAMNED NICEST GO-TO-HELL LETTERS

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.400
I HAVE EVER GOTTEN.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.734
I MEAN IT WAS JUST--

00:17:55.734 --> 00:17:58.434
"WE HAVE CAREFULLY REVIEWED
YOUR APPLICATION,

00:17:58.434 --> 00:18:01.801
"AND PRESENTLY WE DO NOT HAVE
ANY POSITIONS AVAILABLE

00:18:01.801 --> 00:18:05.200
WHICH REQUIRE
YOUR PARTICULAR QUALIFICATIONS."

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.701
NOW, THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT
YOU'RE GETTING THIS FROM A PLACE

00:18:07.701 --> 00:18:11.901
THAT'S FAMOUS FOR GUYS
WHO SWEEP THE STREET.

00:18:11.901 --> 00:18:14.367
SO THAT WAS A BIT OF A SETBACK.

00:18:14.367 --> 00:18:18.634
BUT REMEMBER, THE BRICK WALLS
ARE THERE FOR A REASON.

00:18:18.634 --> 00:18:20.834
ALL RIGHT, THE BRICK WALLS
ARE NOT THERE TO KEEP US OUT.

00:18:20.834 --> 00:18:23.167
THE BRICK WALLS ARE THERE
TO GIVE US A CHANCE

00:18:23.167 --> 00:18:26.167
TO SHOW HOW BADLY
WE WANT SOMETHING,

00:18:26.167 --> 00:18:28.234
BECAUSE THE BRICK WALLS
ARE THERE TO STOP THE PEOPLE

00:18:28.234 --> 00:18:30.767
WHO DON'T WANT IT
BADLY ENOUGH.

00:18:30.767 --> 00:18:35.434
THEY'RE THERE TO STOP
THE OTHER PEOPLE.

00:18:35.434 --> 00:18:37.734
ALL RIGHT,
FAST FORWARD TO 1991.

00:18:37.734 --> 00:18:39.734
WE DID A SYSTEM BACK
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA

00:18:39.734 --> 00:18:42.234
CALLED VIRTUAL REALITY
ON $5 A DAY,

00:18:42.234 --> 00:18:45.400
JUST ONE OF THOSE UNBELIEVABLE
SPECTACULAR THINGS.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.801
I WAS SO SCARED BACK IN
THOSE DAYS AS A JUNIOR ACADEMIC.

00:18:48.801 --> 00:18:51.534
JIM FOLEY'S HERE, AND I JUST
LOVE TO TELL THIS STORY.

00:18:51.534 --> 00:18:53.834
HE KNEW MY UNDERGRADUATE
ADVISOR, ANDY VAN DAM,

00:18:53.834 --> 00:18:56.267
AND I'M AT MY FIRST CONFERENCE,
AND I'M JUST SCARED TO DEATH,

00:18:56.267 --> 00:18:59.601
AND THIS ICON
IN THE USER INTERFACE COMMUNITY

00:18:59.601 --> 00:19:01.100
WALKS UP TO ME
AND JUST OUT OF NOWHERE

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.534
JUST GIVES ME
THIS HUGE BEAR HUG,

00:19:02.534 --> 00:19:05.234
AND HE SAYS,
"THAT WAS FROM ANDY."

00:19:05.234 --> 00:19:08.300
AND THAT WAS WHEN I THOUGHT,
"OKAY, MAYBE I CAN MAKE IT.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.767
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE I DO BELONG."

00:19:10.767 --> 00:19:12.133
AND A SIMILAR STORY

00:19:12.133 --> 00:19:13.801
IS THAT THIS WAS JUST
THIS UNBELIEVABLE HIT

00:19:13.801 --> 00:19:15.167
BECAUSE AT THE TIME,

00:19:15.167 --> 00:19:17.501
EVERYBODY NEEDED $1/2 MILLION
TO DO VIRTUAL REALITY,

00:19:17.501 --> 00:19:18.834
AND EVERYBODY FELT FRUSTRATED,

00:19:18.834 --> 00:19:20.534
AND WE LITERALLY
HACKED TOGETHER A SYSTEM

00:19:20.534 --> 00:19:23.767
FOR ABOUT $5,000 IN PARTS
AND MADE A WORKING VR SYSTEM,

00:19:23.767 --> 00:19:25.234
AND PEOPLE WERE JUST LIKE,
"OH MY GOD,

00:19:25.234 --> 00:19:27.534
THIS IS LIKE , YOU KNOW, THE
HEWLETT-PACKARD GARAGE THING.

00:19:27.534 --> 00:19:29.033
THIS IS SO AWESOME."

00:19:29.033 --> 00:19:31.367
AND SO I'M GIVING THIS TALK,
AND THE ROOM HAS JUST GONE WILD,

00:19:31.367 --> 00:19:33.067
AND DURING THE Q&amp;A,
A GUY NAMED TOM FURNESS,

00:19:33.067 --> 00:19:35.968
WHO WAS ONE OF THE BIG NAMES
IN VIRTUAL REALITY AT THE TIME,

00:19:35.968 --> 00:19:38.133
HE GOES UP TO THE MICROPHONE,
AND HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF.

00:19:38.133 --> 00:19:39.534
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE,

00:19:39.534 --> 00:19:40.801
BUT I SURE AS HELL
KNEW THE NAME.

00:19:40.801 --> 00:19:42.367
AND HE ASKED A QUESTION,
AND I WAS LIKE,

00:19:42.367 --> 00:19:44.767
"I'M SORRY, DID YOU SAY
YOU'RE TOM FURNESS?"

00:19:44.767 --> 00:19:46.067
AND HE SAID, "YES."

00:19:46.067 --> 00:19:48.033
I SAID, "THEN I WOULD LOVE
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION,

00:19:48.033 --> 00:19:50.033
BUT FIRST, WILL YOU
HAVE LUNCH WITH ME TOMORROW?"

00:19:50.033 --> 00:19:52.200
[laughter]

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.767
AND THERE'S A LOT
IN THAT LITTLE MOMENT.

00:19:55.767 --> 00:19:57.234
RIGHT, THERE'S A LOT
OF HUMILITY

00:19:57.234 --> 00:20:00.234
BUT ALSO ASKING A PERSON
WHERE HE CAN'T POSSIBLY SAY NO.

00:20:00.234 --> 00:20:03.167
[laughter]

00:20:06.734 --> 00:20:09.200
AND SO IMAGINEERING
A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.868
WAS WORKING ON
A VIRTUAL REALITY PROJECT.

00:20:10.868 --> 00:20:12.300
THIS WAS TOP SECRET.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.701
THEY WERE DENYING THE EXISTENCE
OF A VIRTUAL REALITY ATTRACTION

00:20:15.701 --> 00:20:18.067
AFTER THE TIME
THAT THE PUBLICITY DEPARTMENT

00:20:18.067 --> 00:20:20.067
WAS RUNNING THE TV COMMERCIALS.

00:20:20.067 --> 00:20:23.300
SO IMAGINEERING REALLY
HAD NAILED THIS ONE TIGHT.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.033
AND IT WAS
THE ALADDIN ATTRACTION

00:20:25.033 --> 00:20:26.701
WHERE YOU WOULD FLY
A MAGIC CARPET,

00:20:26.701 --> 00:20:31.133
AND THE HEAD-MOUNTED DISPLAY,
SOMETIMES KNOWN AS GATOR VISION.

00:20:31.133 --> 00:20:33.834
AND SO I HAD AN IN.

00:20:33.834 --> 00:20:36.133
AS SOON AS THE PROJECT
HAD JUST--

00:20:36.133 --> 00:20:38.133
YOU KNOW, THEY STARTED RUNNING
THE TV COMMERCIALS,

00:20:38.133 --> 00:20:41.100
AND I HAD BEEN ASKED TO BRIEF
THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.367
ON THE STATE OF VIRTUAL REALITY.

00:20:42.367 --> 00:20:45.734
OKAY, FRED BROOKS
AND I HAD BEEN ASKED

00:20:45.734 --> 00:20:47.834
TO BRIEF THE SECRETARY
OF DEFENSE,

00:20:47.834 --> 00:20:51.400
AND THAT GAVE ME AN EXCUSE.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.534
SO I CALLED THEM UP.

00:20:52.534 --> 00:20:54.133
I CALLED IMAGINEERING,
AND I SAID,

00:20:54.133 --> 00:20:56.000
"LOOK, I'M BRIEFING
THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.667
I'D LIKE SOME MATERIALS
ON WHAT YOU HAVE,

00:20:57.667 --> 00:20:59.734
BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE BEST
VR SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD."

00:20:59.734 --> 00:21:01.000
AND THEY KIND OF PUSHED BACK.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.901
AND I SAID, "LOOK, IS ALL
THIS PATRIOTISM STUFF

00:21:02.901 --> 00:21:04.234
IN THE PARKS A FARCE?"

00:21:04.234 --> 00:21:07.467
AND THEY'RE LIKE, "HMM, OKAY,"
BUT THEY SAID,

00:21:07.467 --> 00:21:09.300
"BUT THE PR DEPARTMENT DOESN'T--
THIS IS SO NEW,

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.367
"THE PR DEPARTMENT DOESN'T HAVE
ANY FOOTAGE FOR YOU,

00:21:11.367 --> 00:21:12.868
"SO I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO CONNECT YOU

00:21:12.868 --> 00:21:14.901
STRAIGHT THROUGH TO THE TEAM
WHO DID THE WORK."

00:21:14.901 --> 00:21:16.934
JACKPOT.

00:21:16.934 --> 00:21:19.300
SO I FIND MYSELF ON THE PHONE
WITH A GUY NAMED JON SNODDY

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.634
WHO IS ONE OF THE MOST
IMPRESSIVE GUYS

00:21:21.634 --> 00:21:22.968
I HAVE EVER MET,

00:21:22.968 --> 00:21:24.634
AND HE WAS THE GUY
RUNNING THIS TEAM,

00:21:24.634 --> 00:21:27.167
AND IT'S NOT SURPRISING
THEY HAD DONE IMPRESSIVE THINGS.

00:21:27.167 --> 00:21:28.901
AND SO HE SENT ME SOME STUFF.

00:21:28.901 --> 00:21:30.000
WE TALKED BRIEFLY.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.300
HE SENT ME SOME STUFF,
AND I SAID,

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:32.701
"HEY, I'M GOING TO BE OUT
IN THE AREA

00:21:32.701 --> 00:21:33.901
"FOR A CONFERENCE SHORTLY.

00:21:33.901 --> 00:21:35.701
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GET TOGETHER
AND HAVE LUNCH?"

00:21:35.701 --> 00:21:37.767
TRANSLATION: "I'M GOING
TO LIE TO YOU

00:21:37.767 --> 00:21:39.534
"AND SAY THAT I HAVE AN EXCUSE
TO BE IN THE AREA

00:21:39.534 --> 00:21:41.501
"SO I DON'T LOOK TOO ANXIOUS,

00:21:41.501 --> 00:21:45.300
BUT I WOULD GO TO NEPTUNE
TO HAVE LUNCH WITH YOU."

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:49.434
AND SO JON SAID, "SURE,"

00:21:49.434 --> 00:21:53.367
AND I SPENT SOMETHING LIKE
80 HOURS

00:21:53.367 --> 00:21:56.367
TALKING WITH ALL THE VR EXPERTS
IN THE WORLD, SAYING,

00:21:56.367 --> 00:21:59.367
"IF YOU HAD ACCESS TO THIS ONE
UNBELIEVABLE PROJECT,

00:21:59.367 --> 00:22:01.033
WHAT WOULD YOU ASK?"

00:22:01.033 --> 00:22:03.267
AND THEN I COMPILED ALL OF THAT,
AND I HAD TO MEMORIZE IT,

00:22:03.267 --> 00:22:05.567
WHICH ANYBODY WHO KNOWS ME KNOWS
THAT I HAVE NO MEMORY AT ALL,

00:22:05.567 --> 00:22:07.567
BECAUSE I COULDN'T GO IN LOOKING
LIKE A DWEEB WITH,

00:22:07.567 --> 00:22:09.467
YOU KNOW, "HI, QUESTION 72."

00:22:09.467 --> 00:22:12.934
SO I WENT IN, AND THIS WAS,
LIKE, A TWO-HOUR LUNCH,

00:22:12.934 --> 00:22:14.267
AND JON MUST HAVE THOUGHT

00:22:14.267 --> 00:22:17.400
HE WAS TALKING
TO SOME PHENOMENAL PERSON,

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.033
BECAUSE ALL I WAS DOING
WAS CHANNELING FRED BROOKS

00:22:20.033 --> 00:22:21.667
AND IVAN SUTHERLAND
AND ANDY VAN DAM

00:22:21.667 --> 00:22:23.300
AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT,
AND HENRY FUCHS.

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.968
SO IT'S PRETTY EASY TO BE SMART

00:22:24.968 --> 00:22:28.234
WHEN YOU'RE PARROTING
SMART PEOPLE.

00:22:28.234 --> 00:22:31.467
AND AT THE END OF THE LUNCH
WITH JON, I SORT OF,

00:22:31.467 --> 00:22:33.801
AS WE SAY IN THE BUSINESS,
MADE "THE ASK."

00:22:33.801 --> 00:22:37.801
AND I SAID, "YOU KNOW,
I HAVE A SABBATICAL COMING UP."

00:22:37.801 --> 00:22:38.968
AND HE SAID, "WHAT'S THAT?"

00:22:38.968 --> 00:22:41.901
[laughter]

00:22:43.868 --> 00:22:47.334
THE BEGINNINGS
OF THE CULTURE CLASH.

00:22:47.334 --> 00:22:50.100
AND SO I TALKED WITH HIM
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.868
OF COMING THERE
AND WORKING WITH HIM.

00:22:52.868 --> 00:22:56.334
AND HE SAID, "WELL,
THAT'S REALLY GOOD EXCEPT,

00:22:56.334 --> 00:22:57.767
"YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE IN THE BUSINESS

00:22:57.767 --> 00:22:59.100
"OF TELLING PEOPLE STUFF,

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.901
AND WE'RE IN THE BUSINESS
OF KEEPING SECRETS."

00:23:01.901 --> 00:23:03.467
ALL RIGHT, AND THEN
WHAT MADE JON SNODDY

00:23:03.467 --> 00:23:06.167
JON SNODDY WAS HE SAID,
"BUT WE'LL WORK IT OUT,"

00:23:06.167 --> 00:23:07.467
WHICH I REALLY LOVED.

00:23:07.467 --> 00:23:09.300
THE OTHER THING THAT I LEARNED
FROM JON SNODDY--

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.701
I COULD DO EASILY
AN HOUR-LONG TALK

00:23:10.701 --> 00:23:12.400
JUST ON WHAT HAVE I LEARNED
FROM JON SNODDY.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.200
ONE OF THE THINGS HE TOLD ME
WAS THAT,

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.033
"WAIT LONG ENOUGH, AND PEOPLE
WILL SURPRISE AND IMPRESS YOU."

00:23:17.033 --> 00:23:18.767
HE SAID, "WHEN YOU'RE PISSED OFF
AT SOMEBODY

00:23:18.767 --> 00:23:20.000
"AND YOU'RE ANGRY AT THEM,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.534
"YOU JUST HAVEN'T GIVEN THEM
ENOUGH TIME.

00:23:22.534 --> 00:23:23.934
"JUST GIVE THEM
A LITTLE MORE TIME,

00:23:23.934 --> 00:23:25.501
AND THEY'LL ALMOST ALWAYS
IMPRESS YOU."

00:23:25.501 --> 00:23:26.868
AND THAT REALLY STUCK WITH ME.

00:23:26.868 --> 00:23:28.868
I THINK HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
ON THAT ONE.

00:23:28.868 --> 00:23:34.567
SO TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT,
WE NEGOTIATED A LEGAL CONTRACT.

00:23:34.567 --> 00:23:35.968
IT WAS GOING TO BE THE FIRST--

00:23:35.968 --> 00:23:38.167
SOME PEOPLE REFERRED TO IT
AS THE FIRST AND LAST PAPER

00:23:38.167 --> 00:23:39.968
EVER PUBLISHED BY IMAGINEERING--

00:23:39.968 --> 00:23:42.901
BUT THE DEAL WAS I GO,
I PROVIDE MY OWN FUNDING,

00:23:42.901 --> 00:23:44.667
I GO FOR SIX MONTHS,
I WORK WITH A PROJECT,

00:23:44.667 --> 00:23:47.667
WE PUBLISH A PAPER.

00:23:47.667 --> 00:23:49.601
AND THEN WE MEET OUR VILLAIN.

00:23:51.901 --> 00:23:53.334
I CAN'T BE ALL SWEETNESS
AND LIGHT,

00:23:53.334 --> 00:23:54.868
BECAUSE I HAVE NO CREDIBILITY.

00:23:54.868 --> 00:23:57.234
SOMEBODY'S HEAD'S GOING TO GO
ON A STICK.

00:23:57.234 --> 00:23:59.367
TURNS OUT THAT THE PERSON
WHO GETS HIS HEAD ON THE STICK

00:23:59.367 --> 00:24:01.601
IS A DEAN BACK
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.

00:24:01.601 --> 00:24:02.667
HIS NAME IS NOT IMPORTANT.

00:24:02.667 --> 00:24:04.467
LET'S CALL HIM DEAN WORMER.

00:24:04.467 --> 00:24:07.400
[laughter]

00:24:09.934 --> 00:24:12.534
AND DEAN WORMER HAS A MEETING
WITH ME WHERE I SAY,

00:24:12.534 --> 00:24:14.033
"I WANT TO DO
THIS SABBATICAL THING,

00:24:14.033 --> 00:24:15.968
"AND I'VE ACTUALLY GOTTEN
THE IMAGINEERING GUYS

00:24:15.968 --> 00:24:17.667
TO LET AN ACADEMIC IN,"
WHICH IS INSANE.

00:24:17.667 --> 00:24:19.267
I MEAN, IF JON HADN'T GONE NUTS,

00:24:19.267 --> 00:24:20.934
THIS WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN
A POSSIBILITY.

00:24:20.934 --> 00:24:22.501
THIS IS A VERY
SECRETIVE ORGANIZATION.

00:24:22.501 --> 00:24:23.801
AND DEAN WORMER LOOKS
AT THE PAPERWORK, AND HE SAYS,

00:24:23.801 --> 00:24:25.200
"WELL, IT SAYS
THEY'RE GOING TO OWN

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.634
YOUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY."

00:24:26.634 --> 00:24:28.934
AND I SAID, "YEAH, WE GOT THE
AGREEMENT TO PUBLISH THE PAPER.

00:24:28.934 --> 00:24:30.968
"THERE IS NO OTHER IP.
I DON'T DO PATENTABLE STUFF."

00:24:30.968 --> 00:24:32.968
AND HE SAYS, "YEAH,
BUT YOU MIGHT, SO DEAL'S OFF.

00:24:32.968 --> 00:24:36.234
"JUST GO AND GET THEM TO CHANGE
THAT LITTLE CLAUSE THERE

00:24:36.234 --> 00:24:39.501
AND THEN COME BACK TO ME."

00:24:39.501 --> 00:24:41.634
I'M LIKE, "EXCUSE ME?"

00:24:41.634 --> 00:24:43.100
AND THEN I SAID TO HIM,

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.033
"I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND
HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS.

00:24:45.033 --> 00:24:46.367
"IF WE CAN'T WORK THIS OUT,

00:24:46.367 --> 00:24:48.767
"I'M GOING TO TAKE
AN UNPAID LEAVE OF ABSENCE,

00:24:48.767 --> 00:24:53.400
AND I'M JUST GOING TO GO THERE,
AND I'M GOING TO DO THIS THING."

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.901
AND HE SAID, "HEY, YOU KNOW,

00:24:55.901 --> 00:24:57.434
"I MIGHT NOT EVEN
LET YOU DO THAT.

00:24:57.434 --> 00:24:59.267
"I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT THE IP
IN YOUR HEAD ALREADY,

00:24:59.267 --> 00:25:01.167
"AND MAYBE THEY'RE GOING
TO SUCK IT OUT OF YOU,

00:25:01.167 --> 00:25:03.601
SO THAT'S NOT GOING
TO FLY EITHER."

00:25:03.601 --> 00:25:06.534
[laughter]

00:25:08.234 --> 00:25:12.367
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW
WHEN YOU'RE IN A PISSING MATCH,

00:25:12.367 --> 00:25:13.467
AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

00:25:13.467 --> 00:25:15.934
TO GET OUT OF IT
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

00:25:15.934 --> 00:25:19.501
SO I SAID TO HIM, "WELL,
LET'S BACK OFF ON THIS.

00:25:19.501 --> 00:25:21.767
DO WE THINK THIS IS
A GOOD IDEA AT ALL?"

00:25:21.767 --> 00:25:24.601
HE SAID, "I HAVE NO IDEA IF THIS
IS A GOOD IDEA, YOU KNOW."

00:25:24.601 --> 00:25:28.133
I WAS LIKE, "OKAY, WELL,
WE'VE GOT COMMON GROUND THERE."

00:25:28.133 --> 00:25:29.934
THEN I SAID, "WELL,
IS THIS REALLY YOUR CALL?

00:25:29.934 --> 00:25:32.300
ISN'T THIS THE CALL OF
THE DEAN OF SPONSORED RESEARCH

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.367
IF IT'S AN IP ISSUE?"

00:25:33.367 --> 00:25:34.734
AND HE SAID,
"YEAH, THAT'S TRUE."

00:25:34.734 --> 00:25:36.434
I SAID, "BUT SO IF HE'S HAPPY,
YOU'RE HAPPY?"

00:25:36.434 --> 00:25:37.434
"YEAH, THEN I'D BE FINE."

00:25:37.434 --> 00:25:38.434
pew!

00:25:38.434 --> 00:25:39.634
LIKE WILE E. COYOTE.

00:25:39.634 --> 00:25:41.234
AND I FIND MYSELF
IN GENE BLOCK'S OFFICE,

00:25:41.234 --> 00:25:42.901
WHO IS THE MOST FANTASTIC MAN
IN THE WORLD,

00:25:42.901 --> 00:25:44.601
AND I START TALKING
TO GENE BLOCK, AND I SAY,

00:25:44.601 --> 00:25:45.868
"LET'S START AT THE HIGH LEVEL,"

00:25:45.868 --> 00:25:47.000
SINCE I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
TO BACK OUT AGAIN.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.334
"SO LET'S START
AT THE HIGH LEVEL.

00:25:48.334 --> 00:25:49.801
DO YOU THINK THIS IS
A GOOD IDEA?"

00:25:49.801 --> 00:25:51.868
HE SAID, "WELL, IF YOU'RE ASKING
ME IF IT'S A GOOD IDEA,

00:25:51.868 --> 00:25:53.334
"I DON'T HAVE
VERY MUCH INFORMATION.

00:25:53.334 --> 00:25:55.234
"ALL I KNOW IS THAT ONE
OF MY STAR FACULTY MEMBERS

00:25:55.234 --> 00:25:56.501
"IS IN MY OFFICE,
AND HE'S REALLY EXCITED,

00:25:56.501 --> 00:25:57.834
SO TELL ME MORE."

00:25:57.834 --> 00:25:59.901
HERE'S A LESSON FOR EVERYBODY
IN ADMINISTRATION.

00:25:59.901 --> 00:26:03.100
THEY BOTH SAID THE SAME THING,

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:07.000
BUT THINK ABOUT
HOW THEY SAID IT, RIGHT?

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.534
"I DON'T KNOW!"

00:26:08.534 --> 00:26:10.100
"WELL, I DON'T HAVE
MUCH INFORMATION,

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:12.067
"BUT ONE OF MY STAR
FACULTY MEMBERS IS HERE,

00:26:12.067 --> 00:26:14.133
AND HE'S ALL EXCITED,
SO I WANT TO LEARN MORE."

00:26:14.133 --> 00:26:15.868
THEY'RE BOTH WAYS OF SAYING
I DON'T KNOW,

00:26:15.868 --> 00:26:18.067
BUT, BOY, THERE'S A GOOD WAY
AND A BAD WAY.

00:26:18.067 --> 00:26:21.000
SO ANYWAY, WE GOT IT
ALL WORKED OUT.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.901
I WENT TO IMAGINEERING,
SWEETNESS AND LIGHT,

00:26:23.901 --> 00:26:25.501
AND ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL.

00:26:29.434 --> 00:26:33.300
SOME BRICK WALLS
ARE MADE OF FLESH.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.400
SO I WORKED ON
THE ALADDIN PROJECT.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:40.567
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR,
I MEAN, JUST UNBELIEVABLE.

00:26:40.567 --> 00:26:41.868
HERE'S MY NEPHEW CHRISTOPHER.

00:26:41.868 --> 00:26:43.200
THIS WAS THE APPARATUS.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.267
YOU WOULD SIT ON THIS SORT
OF MOTORCYCLE-TYPE THING,

00:26:45.267 --> 00:26:47.501
AND YOU WOULD STEER
YOUR MAGIC CARPET,

00:26:47.501 --> 00:26:49.567
AND YOU WOULD PUT ON
THE HEAD-MOUNTED DISPLAY.

00:26:49.567 --> 00:26:51.501
THE HEAD-MOUNTED DISPLAY
WAS VERY INTERESTING.

00:26:51.501 --> 00:26:53.834
IT HAD TWO PARTS, AND IT WAS
A VERY, VERY CLEVER DESIGN.

00:26:53.834 --> 00:26:55.467
TO GET THROUGHPUT THROUGH,
THE ONLY PART

00:26:55.467 --> 00:26:57.467
THAT TOUCHED THE GUEST'S HEAD
WAS THIS LITTLE CAP,

00:26:57.467 --> 00:26:58.934
AND EVERYTHING ELSE
CLICKED ONTO IT,

00:26:58.934 --> 00:27:00.100
ALL THE EXPENSIVE HARDWARE.

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:01.467
SO YOU COULD REPLICATE THE CAPS

00:27:01.467 --> 00:27:03.801
BECAUSE THEY WERE BASICALLY
FREE TO MANUFACTURE.

00:27:03.801 --> 00:27:05.133
THIS IS WHAT I REALLY DID IS,

00:27:05.133 --> 00:27:08.934
I WAS A CAP CLEANER
DURING THE SABBATICAL.

00:27:08.934 --> 00:27:11.501
I LOVED IMAGINEERING.

00:27:11.501 --> 00:27:15.334
IT WAS JUST A SPECTACULAR PLACE,
JUST SPECTACULAR,

00:27:15.334 --> 00:27:16.667
EVERYTHING THAT I HAD DREAMED.

00:27:16.667 --> 00:27:18.000
I LOVED THE MODEL SHOP,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.601
PEOPLE CRAWLING AROUND ON THINGS
THE SIZE OF THIS ROOM

00:27:20.601 --> 00:27:22.067
THAT ARE JUST
BIG PHYSICAL MODELS.

00:27:22.067 --> 00:27:24.767
IT WAS JUST AN INCREDIBLE PLACE
TO WALK AROUND

00:27:24.767 --> 00:27:26.367
AND BE INSPIRED.

00:27:26.367 --> 00:27:29.534
I'M ALWAYS REMINDED OF WHEN
I WENT THERE AND PEOPLE SAID,

00:27:29.534 --> 00:27:31.300
"DO YOU THINK THE EXPECTATIONS
ARE TOO HIGH?"

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.667
AND I SAID, "YOU EVER SEE
THE MOVIE

00:27:32.667 --> 00:27:34.200
"CHARLIE
AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY"--

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.801
"WILLY WONKA
AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY"

00:27:35.801 --> 00:27:37.367
WHERE GENE WILDER SAYS
TO THE LITTLE BOY CHARLIE--

00:27:37.367 --> 00:27:38.767
HE'S ABOUT TO GIVE HIM
THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY.

00:27:38.767 --> 00:27:40.767
HE SAYS, "WELL, CHARLIE,
DID ANYBODY EVER TELL YOU

00:27:40.767 --> 00:27:42.067
"THE STORY OF THE LITTLE BOY

00:27:42.067 --> 00:27:45.667
WHO SUDDENLY GOT EVERYTHING
HE EVER WANTED?"

00:27:45.667 --> 00:27:48.200
CHARLIE'S EYES GET LIKE SAUCERS,
AND HE SAYS,

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.133
"NO, WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?"

00:27:50.133 --> 00:27:54.367
GENE WILDER SAYS,
"HE LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER."

00:27:54.367 --> 00:27:56.767
OKAY, SO WORKING ON
THE ALADDIN VR,

00:27:56.767 --> 00:27:57.968
I DESCRIBED IT AS

00:27:57.968 --> 00:27:59.734
A ONCE-IN-EVERY-FIVE-YEARS
OPPORTUNITY,

00:27:59.734 --> 00:28:01.300
AND I STAND BY THAT ASSESSMENT.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:03.234
IT FOREVER CHANGED ME.

00:28:03.234 --> 00:28:04.834
IT WASN'T JUST THAT IT
WAS GOOD WORK

00:28:04.834 --> 00:28:06.968
AND I GOT TO BE A PART OF IT,

00:28:06.968 --> 00:28:10.067
BUT IT GOT ME INTO THE PLACE
OF WORKING WITH REAL PEOPLE

00:28:10.067 --> 00:28:12.601
AND REAL HCI
USER INTERFACE ISSUES.

00:28:12.601 --> 00:28:15.067
MOST HCI PEOPLE LIVE IN THIS
FANTASY WORLD

00:28:15.067 --> 00:28:18.701
OF WHITE COLLAR LABORERS
WITH PhDs AND MASTER'S DEGREES.

00:28:18.701 --> 00:28:20.667
YOU KNOW, UNTIL YOU GOT
ICE CREAM SPILLED ON YOU,

00:28:20.667 --> 00:28:23.901
YOU'RE NOT DOING FIELD WORK,
ALL RIGHT?

00:28:23.901 --> 00:28:26.334
AND MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE,
FROM JON SNODDY I LEARNED

00:28:26.334 --> 00:28:28.467
HOW TO PUT ARTISTS
AND ENGINEERS TOGETHER,

00:28:28.467 --> 00:28:30.400
AND THAT'S BEEN THE REAL LEGACY.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.601
WE PUBLISHED A PAPER,

00:28:31.601 --> 00:28:33.434
JUST A NICE ACADEMIC
CULTURAL SCANDAL.

00:28:33.434 --> 00:28:35.601
WHEN WE WROTE THE PAPER,
THE GUYS AT IMAGINEERING SAID,

00:28:35.601 --> 00:28:38.234
"WELL, LET'S DO
A NICE BIG PICTURE

00:28:38.234 --> 00:28:39.968
LIKE YOU WOULD IN A MAGAZINE."

00:28:39.968 --> 00:28:42.067
AND THE SIGGRAPH COMMITTEE,
WHICH ACCEPTED THE PAPER,

00:28:42.067 --> 00:28:43.601
IT WAS LIKE THIS BIG SCANDAL.

00:28:43.601 --> 00:28:45.467
"ARE THEY ALLOWED TO DO THAT?"

00:28:45.467 --> 00:28:47.601
[laughter]

00:28:47.601 --> 00:28:50.467
THERE WAS NO RULE.

00:28:50.467 --> 00:28:52.467
SO WE PUBLISHED THE PAPER,
AND AMAZINGLY,

00:28:52.467 --> 00:28:54.467
SINCE THEN, THERE'S A TRADITION
OF SIGGRAPH PAPERS

00:28:54.467 --> 00:28:57.067
HAVING COLOR FIGURES
ON THE FIRST PAGE.

00:28:57.067 --> 00:29:00.767
SO I'VE CHANGED THE WORLD
IN A SMALL WAY.

00:29:00.767 --> 00:29:04.033
AND THEN AT THE END
OF MY SIX MONTHS,

00:29:04.033 --> 00:29:05.334
THEY CAME TO ME,
AND THEY SAID,

00:29:05.334 --> 00:29:08.767
"YOU WANT TO DO IT FOR REAL?
YOU CAN STAY."

00:29:14.567 --> 00:29:16.567
AND I SAID, "NO."

00:29:16.567 --> 00:29:19.000
ONE OF THE ONLY TIMES IN MY LIFE
I HAVE SURPRISED MY FATHER.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.033
HE WAS LIKE, "YOU WHAT?"

00:29:22.033 --> 00:29:24.701
HE SAID, "SINCE YOU WERE,
YOU KNOW, ALL YOU WANTED,

00:29:24.701 --> 00:29:27.667
AND NOW THAT YOU GOT IT,
AND YOU'RE--HUH?"

00:29:27.667 --> 00:29:29.634
THERE WAS A BOTTLE OF MAALOX
IN MY DESK DRAWER.

00:29:29.634 --> 00:29:30.834
BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR.

00:29:30.834 --> 00:29:32.534
IT WAS A PARTICULARLY
STRESSFUL PLACE.

00:29:32.534 --> 00:29:35.534
IMAGINEERING IN GENERAL
IS ACTUALLY NOT SO MAALOX-LADEN,

00:29:35.534 --> 00:29:39.067
BUT THE LAB I WAS IN--
OH, JON LEFT IN THE MIDDLE,

00:29:39.067 --> 00:29:41.667
AND IT WAS A LOT LIKE
THE SOVIET UNION.

00:29:41.667 --> 00:29:44.133
IT WAS A LITTLE DICEY
FOR A WHILE,

00:29:44.133 --> 00:29:45.501
BUT IT WORKED OUT OKAY,

00:29:45.501 --> 00:29:47.601
AND IF THEY HAD SAID,
"STAY HERE

00:29:47.601 --> 00:29:49.067
OR NEVER WALK
IN THE BUILDING AGAIN,"

00:29:49.067 --> 00:29:50.734
I WOULD HAVE DONE IT.

00:29:50.734 --> 00:29:52.467
I WOULD HAVE WALKED AWAY
FROM TENURE.

00:29:52.467 --> 00:29:54.100
I WOULD HAVE JUST DONE IT.

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:55.334
BUT THEY MADE IT EASY ON ME.

00:29:55.334 --> 00:29:57.267
THEY SAID, "YOU CAN HAVE
YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO,"

00:29:57.267 --> 00:29:58.367
AND I BASICALLY BECOME

00:29:58.367 --> 00:30:00.133
A DAY-A-WEEK CONSULTANT
FOR IMAGINEERING,

00:30:00.133 --> 00:30:01.634
AND I DID THAT
FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS,

00:30:01.634 --> 00:30:03.100
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.701
YOU SHOULD ALL
BECOME PROFESSORS,

00:30:05.701 --> 00:30:09.767
BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE YOUR CAKE
AND EAT IT TOO, OKAY?

00:30:09.767 --> 00:30:11.968
I WENT ON AND CONSULTED
ON THINGS LIKE DISNEYQUEST.

00:30:11.968 --> 00:30:13.801
SO THERE WAS
THE VIRTUAL JUNGLE CRUISE

00:30:13.801 --> 00:30:16.834
AND THE BEST INTERACTIVE
EXPERIENCE I THINK EVER DONE--

00:30:16.834 --> 00:30:18.968
AND JESSE SCHELL
GETS THE CREDIT FOR THIS--

00:30:18.968 --> 00:30:23.067
PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN,
WONDERFUL AT DISNEYQUEST.

00:30:23.067 --> 00:30:24.868
AND SO THOSE ARE
MY CHILDHOOD DREAMS,

00:30:24.868 --> 00:30:27.000
AND, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.267
I FELT GOOD ABOUT THAT.

00:30:28.267 --> 00:30:29.968
SO THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES,

00:30:29.968 --> 00:30:33.033
HOW CAN I ENABLE
THE CHILDHOOD DREAMS OF OTHERS?

00:30:33.033 --> 00:30:35.868
AND AGAIN, BOY, AM I GLAD
I BECAME A PROFESSOR.

00:30:35.868 --> 00:30:41.868
WHAT BETTER PLACE
TO ENABLE CHILDHOOD DREAMS?

00:30:41.868 --> 00:30:43.234
MAYBE WORKING AT EA,
I DON'T KNOW.

00:30:43.234 --> 00:30:47.467
THAT'D PROBABLY BE
A GOOD CLOSE SECOND.

00:30:47.467 --> 00:30:52.601
AND THIS STARTED IN
A VERY CONCRETE REALIZATION

00:30:52.601 --> 00:30:54.400
THAT I COULD DO THIS,

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.167
BECAUSE A YOUNG MAN
NAMED TOMMY BURNETTE,

00:30:56.167 --> 00:30:58.200
WHEN I WAS AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF VIRGINIA, CAME TO ME,

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.300
WAS INTERESTED IN JOINING
MY RESEARCH GROUP,

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.300
AND WE TALKED ABOUT IT,
AND HE SAID,

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.534
"OH, AND I HAVE
A CHILDHOOD DREAM."

00:31:04.534 --> 00:31:07.701
IT GETS PRETTY EASY TO RECOGNIZE
THEM WHEN THEY TELL YOU.

00:31:07.701 --> 00:31:10.133
AND I SAID, "YES, TOMMY,
WHAT IS YOUR CHILDHOOD DREAM?"

00:31:10.133 --> 00:31:14.834
HE SAID, "I WANT TO WORK ON
THE NEXT "STAR WARS" FILM."

00:31:14.834 --> 00:31:16.934
NOW, YOU GOT TO REMEMBER
THE TIMING ON THIS.

00:31:16.934 --> 00:31:18.400
WHERE IS TOMMY?
TOMMY IS HERE TODAY.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.734
WHAT YEAR WOULD THIS HAVE BEEN?
YOUR SOPHOMORE YEAR.

00:31:20.734 --> 00:31:21.734
woman: RIGHT THERE.

00:31:21.734 --> 00:31:23.133
man: IT WAS AROUND 1993.

00:31:23.133 --> 00:31:25.434
Pausch: ARE YOU BREAKING
ANYTHING BACK THERE, YOUNG MAN?

00:31:25.434 --> 00:31:27.400
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, SO IN 1993.

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.601
AND I SAID TO TOMMY,
"YOU KNOW

00:31:29.601 --> 00:31:33.067
THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING
TO MAKE THOSE NEXT MOVIES."

00:31:33.067 --> 00:31:36.000
[laughter]

00:31:38.033 --> 00:31:41.667
AND HE SAID, "NO, THEY ARE."

00:31:41.667 --> 00:31:44.601
[laughter]

00:31:45.868 --> 00:31:48.934
AND TOMMY WORKED WITH ME
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS

00:31:48.934 --> 00:31:50.767
AS AN UNDERGRADUATE
AND THEN AS A STAFF MEMBER,

00:31:50.767 --> 00:31:52.534
AND THEN WHEN I MOVED
TO CARNEGIE MELLON,

00:31:52.534 --> 00:31:54.534
EVERY SINGLE MEMBER OF MY TEAM

00:31:54.534 --> 00:31:57.267
CAME FROM VIRGINIA
TO CARNEGIE MELLON

00:31:57.267 --> 00:32:00.901
EXCEPT FOR TOMMY,
BECAUSE HE GOT A BETTER OFFER,

00:32:00.901 --> 00:32:03.534
AND HE DID, INDEED,
WORK ON ALL

00:32:03.534 --> 00:32:07.100
THREE OF THOSE FILMS.

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:08.534
AND THEN I SAID,
"WELL, THAT'S NICE,

00:32:08.534 --> 00:32:11.667
BUT, YOU KNOW, ONE AT A TIME
IS KIND OF INEFFICIENT."

00:32:11.667 --> 00:32:14.334
AND PEOPLE WHO KNOW ME KNOW
THAT I'M AN EFFICIENCY FREAK.

00:32:14.334 --> 00:32:16.534
SO I SAID, "CAN I DO THIS
EN MASSE?

00:32:16.534 --> 00:32:19.200
CAN I GET PEOPLE TURNED
IN SUCH A WAY

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.734
THAT THEY CAN BE TURNED ON
TO THEIR CHILDHOOD DREAMS?"

00:32:21.734 --> 00:32:23.667
AND I CREATED A COURSE,
I CAME TO CARNEGIE MELLON,

00:32:23.667 --> 00:32:25.868
AND I CREATED A COURSE CALLED
"BUILDING VIRTUAL WORLDS."

00:32:25.868 --> 00:32:27.300
IT'S A VERY SIMPLE COURSE.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:30.267
HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE HAVE
EVER BEEN TO ANY OF THE SHOWS?

00:32:30.267 --> 00:32:31.734
OKAY, SO SOME OF YOU HAVE
AN IDEA.

00:32:31.734 --> 00:32:33.801
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T,
THE COURSE IS VERY SIMPLE.

00:32:33.801 --> 00:32:35.133
THERE ARE 50 STUDENTS DRAWN

00:32:35.133 --> 00:32:37.467
FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT
DEPARTMENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY.

00:32:37.467 --> 00:32:39.834
THERE ARE RANDOMLY CHOSEN--

00:32:39.834 --> 00:32:43.200
RANDOMLY CHOSEN TEAMS,
FOUR PEOPLE PER TEAM,

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.767
AND THEY CHANGE EVERY PROJECT.

00:32:44.767 --> 00:32:47.434
A PROJECT ONLY LASTS TWO WEEKS,
SO YOU DO SOMETHING,

00:32:47.434 --> 00:32:49.634
YOU MAKE SOMETHING,
YOU SHOW SOMETHING,

00:32:49.634 --> 00:32:52.067
THEN I SHUFFLE THE TEAMS,
YOU GET THREE NEW PLAYMATES,

00:32:52.067 --> 00:32:55.467
AND YOU DO IT AGAIN,
AND IT'S EVERY TWO WEEKS,

00:32:55.467 --> 00:32:58.834
AND SO YOU DO FIVE PROJECTS
DURING THE SEMESTER.

00:32:58.834 --> 00:33:00.601
THE FIRST YEAR
WE TAUGHT THIS COURSE,

00:33:00.601 --> 00:33:03.000
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.133
HOW MUCH OF A TIGER BY THE TAIL
WE HAD.

00:33:06.133 --> 00:33:07.400
I WAS JUST RUNNING THE COURSE

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.167
BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE
IF WE COULD DO IT.

00:33:09.167 --> 00:33:11.601
WE HAD JUST LEARNED HOW TO DO
TEXTURE MAPPING ON 3D GRAPHICS,

00:33:11.601 --> 00:33:13.501
AND WE COULD MAKE STUFF
THAT LOOKED HALF DECENT.

00:33:13.501 --> 00:33:14.734
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE WERE RUNNING

00:33:14.734 --> 00:33:17.934
ON REALLY WEAK COMPUTERS
BY CURRENT STANDARDS.

00:33:17.934 --> 00:33:19.300
BUT I SAID, "I'LL GIVE IT
A TRY."

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.467
AND AT MY NEW UNIVERSITY,
I MADE A COUPLE OF PHONE CALLS,

00:33:21.467 --> 00:33:23.234
AND I SAID, "I WANT
TO CROSS-LIST THIS COURSE

00:33:23.234 --> 00:33:25.234
TO GET ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE,"
AND WITHIN 24 HOURS,

00:33:25.234 --> 00:33:27.901
IT WAS CROSS-LISTED
IN FIVE DEPARTMENTS.

00:33:27.901 --> 00:33:29.501
I LOVE THIS UNIVERSITY.

00:33:29.501 --> 00:33:32.067
I MEAN, IT'S JUST--
IT'S THE MOST AMAZING PLACE.

00:33:32.067 --> 00:33:34.100
AND THE KIDS SAID, "WELL,
WHAT CONTENT DO WE MAKE?"

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.000
I SAID, "HELL, I DON'T KNOW.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.334
"YOU MAKE WHATEVER YOU WANT.

00:33:37.334 --> 00:33:41.367
TWO RULES: NO SHOOTING VIOLENCE
AND NO PORNOGRAPHY."

00:33:41.367 --> 00:33:43.868
NOT BECAUSE I'M OPPOSED TO THOSE
IN PARTICULAR,

00:33:43.868 --> 00:33:48.968
BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S BEEN DONE
WITH VR, RIGHT?

00:33:48.968 --> 00:33:50.968
AND YOU'D BE AMAZED
HOW MANY 19-YEAR-OLD BOYS

00:33:50.968 --> 00:33:54.534
ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF IDEAS WHEN
YOU TAKE THOSE OFF THE TABLE.

00:33:54.534 --> 00:33:57.467
[laughter]

00:33:59.667 --> 00:34:01.934
ANYWAY, SO I TAUGHT THE COURSE.

00:34:01.934 --> 00:34:04.200
THE FIRST ASSIGNMENT,
I GAVE IT TO THEM,

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:08.200
THEY CAME BACK IN TWO WEEKS,
AND THEY JUST BLEW ME AWAY.

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:12.067
I MEAN, THE WORK WAS SO BEYOND,
LITERALLY, MY IMAGINATION,

00:34:12.067 --> 00:34:14.734
BECAUSE I HAD COPIED THE PROCESS
FROM IMAGINEERING'S VR LAB,

00:34:14.734 --> 00:34:16.234
BUT I HAD NO IDEA

00:34:16.234 --> 00:34:19.367
WHAT THEY COULD OR COULDN'T DO
WITH IT AS UNDERGRADUATES,

00:34:19.367 --> 00:34:20.601
AND THEIR TOOLS WERE WEAKER,

00:34:20.601 --> 00:34:22.300
AND THEY CAME BACK
ON THE FIRST ASSIGNMENT,

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:24.167
AND THEY DID SOMETHING
THAT WAS SO SPECTACULAR

00:34:24.167 --> 00:34:26.300
THAT I LITERALLY DIDN'T--
TEN YEARS AS A PROFESSOR,

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.067
AND I HAD NO IDEA
WHAT TO DO NEXT.

00:34:28.067 --> 00:34:29.801
SO I CALLED UP MY MENTOR.

00:34:29.801 --> 00:34:33.300
I CALLED UP ANDY VAN DAM,
AND I SAID,

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:35.133
"ANDY, I JUST GAVE
A TWO-WEEK ASSIGNMENT,

00:34:35.133 --> 00:34:36.467
"AND THEY CAME BACK
AND DID STUFF

00:34:36.467 --> 00:34:38.133
"THAT IF I HAD GIVEN THEM
A WHOLE SEMESTER,

00:34:38.133 --> 00:34:39.601
"I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM
ALL "A"s.

00:34:39.601 --> 00:34:43.701
SENSEI, WHAT DO I DO?"

00:34:43.701 --> 00:34:47.601
AND ANDY THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE,
AND HE SAID,

00:34:47.601 --> 00:34:49.667
"YOU GO BACK
INTO CLASS TOMORROW,

00:34:49.667 --> 00:34:51.567
"AND YOU LOOK THEM IN THE EYE,
AND YOU SAY,

00:34:51.567 --> 00:34:54.634
'GUYS, THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD,
BUT I KNOW YOU CAN DO BETTER.'"

00:34:54.634 --> 00:34:57.567
[laughter]

00:34:58.734 --> 00:35:00.267
AND THAT WAS EXACTLY
THE RIGHT ADVICE,

00:35:00.267 --> 00:35:01.667
BECAUSE WHAT HE SAID WAS,

00:35:01.667 --> 00:35:05.067
"YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW
WHERE THE BAR SHOULD BE,

00:35:05.067 --> 00:35:07.300
"AND YOU'RE ONLY GOING
TO DO THEM A DISSERVICE

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.067
BY PUTTING IT ANYWHERE."

00:35:10.067 --> 00:35:12.200
AND, BOY,
WAS THAT GOOD ADVICE,

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:16.367
BECAUSE THEY JUST KEPT GOING,
AND DURING THAT SEMESTER,

00:35:16.367 --> 00:35:18.601
IT BECAME
THIS UNDERGROUND THING.

00:35:18.601 --> 00:35:21.467
I'D WALK INTO A CLASS
WITH 50 STUDENTS IN IT,

00:35:21.467 --> 00:35:25.968
AND THERE WERE 95 PEOPLE
IN THE ROOM,

00:35:25.968 --> 00:35:27.934
BECAUSE IT WAS THE DAY
WE WERE SHOWING WORK,

00:35:27.934 --> 00:35:31.601
AND PEOPLE'S ROOMMATES
AND FRIENDS AND PARENTS--

00:35:31.601 --> 00:35:34.901
I'D NEVER HAD PARENTS
COME TO CLASS BEFORE.

00:35:34.901 --> 00:35:37.501
IT WAS FLATTERING
AND SOMEWHAT SCARY.

00:35:37.501 --> 00:35:40.300
AND SO IT SNOWBALLED, AND WE HAD
THIS BIZARRE THING OF,

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:41.734
"WELL, WE'VE GOT TO SHARE THIS."

00:35:41.734 --> 00:35:43.434
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I'VE BEEN RAISED TO DO,

00:35:43.434 --> 00:35:44.801
IT'S TO SHARE,
AND I SAID,

00:35:44.801 --> 00:35:46.734
"WE'VE GOT TO SHOW THIS
AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER.

00:35:46.734 --> 00:35:47.834
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A BIG SHOW."

00:35:47.834 --> 00:35:49.167
AND WE BOOKED THIS ROOM,
MCCONOMY.

00:35:49.167 --> 00:35:50.767
I HAVE A LOT OF GOOD MEMORIES
IN THIS ROOM.

00:35:50.767 --> 00:35:52.934
AND WE BOOKED IT NOT BECAUSE
WE THOUGHT WE COULD FILL IT,

00:35:52.934 --> 00:35:55.734
BUT BECAUSE IT HAD THE ONLY A/V
SETUP THAT WOULD WORK,

00:35:55.734 --> 00:36:00.100
BECAUSE THIS WAS A ZOO,
COMPUTERS AND EVERYTHING.

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:02.934
AND THEN WE FILLED IT,
AND WE MORE THAN FILLED IT.

00:36:02.934 --> 00:36:04.501
WE HAD PEOPLE STANDING
IN THE AISLE.

00:36:04.501 --> 00:36:07.133
I WILL NEVER FORGET THE DEAN
AT THE TIME, JIM MORRIS,

00:36:07.133 --> 00:36:09.801
WAS SITTING ON THE STAGE
RIGHT ABOUT THERE.

00:36:09.801 --> 00:36:12.968
WE HAD TO KIND OF SCOOT HIM
OUT OF THE WAY.

00:36:12.968 --> 00:36:15.267
AND THE ENERGY IN THE ROOM
WAS LIKE NOTHING

00:36:15.267 --> 00:36:17.534
I HAD EVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE,
AND PRESIDENT COHON,

00:36:17.534 --> 00:36:21.234
JERRY COHON WAS THERE,
AND HE SENSED THE SAME THING.

00:36:21.234 --> 00:36:22.567
HE LATER DESCRIBED IT AS LIKE

00:36:22.567 --> 00:36:27.834
AN OHIO STATE FOOTBALL PEP RALLY
EXCEPT FOR ACADEMICS,

00:36:27.834 --> 00:36:30.033
AND HE CAME OVER, AND HE ASKED
EXACTLY THE RIGHT QUESTION.

00:36:30.033 --> 00:36:31.367
HE SAID, "BEFORE YOU START,"

00:36:31.367 --> 00:36:34.100
HE SAID, "I GOT TO KNOW,
WHERE ARE THESE PEOPLE FROM?"

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.400
HE SAID, "THE AUDIENCE,
WHAT DEPARTMENTS ARE THEY FROM?"

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.701
AND WE POLLED THEM,
AND IT WAS ALL THE DEPARTMENTS,

00:36:38.701 --> 00:36:39.834
AND I FELT VERY GOOD,

00:36:39.834 --> 00:36:41.534
BECAUSE I HAD
JUST COME TO CAMPUS.

00:36:41.534 --> 00:36:43.100
HE HAD JUST COME TO CAMPUS,

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:46.567
AND MY NEW BOSS HAD SEEN
IN A VERY CORPORAL WAY

00:36:46.567 --> 00:36:50.534
THAT THIS IS THE UNIVERSITY
THAT PUTS EVERYBODY TOGETHER,

00:36:50.534 --> 00:36:53.801
AND THAT MADE ME FEEL
JUST TREMENDOUS.

00:36:53.801 --> 00:36:55.367
SO WE DID
THIS CAMPUS-WIDE EXHIBITION.

00:36:55.367 --> 00:36:56.801
PEOPLE PERFORMED DOWN HERE.

00:36:56.801 --> 00:36:59.367
THEY'RE IN COSTUME,
AND WE PROJECT JUST LIKE THIS,

00:36:59.367 --> 00:37:00.934
AND YOU CAN SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

00:37:00.934 --> 00:37:02.400
YOU CAN SEE WHAT THEY'RE SEEING

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.400
IN THE HEAD MOUNT.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.734
THERE'S A LOT OF BIG PROPS.

00:37:04.734 --> 00:37:08.200
SO THERE'S A GUY
WHITE WATER RAFTING.

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:13.400
THIS IS BEN IN "E.T."

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.100
AND YES, I DID TELL THEM
IF THEY DIDN'T DO

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.834
THE SHOT OF THE KIDS
BIKING ACROSS THE MOON,

00:37:16.834 --> 00:37:17.834
I WOULD FAIL HIM.

00:37:17.834 --> 00:37:19.400
THAT IS A TRUE STORY.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.501
AND I THOUGHT
I'D SHOW YOU JUST--

00:37:21.501 --> 00:37:25.300
[laughter]

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:26.868
SO I THOUGHT I'D SHOW YOU
JUST ONE WORLD,

00:37:26.868 --> 00:37:29.934
AND IF WE CAN GET THE LIGHTS
DOWN IF THAT'S AT ALL POSSIBLE.

00:37:29.934 --> 00:37:31.200
NO, OKAY, THAT MEANS NO.

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.400
ALL RIGHT.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.334
ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL JUST DO OUR BEST THEN.

TURN THIS ON ITS HEAD.

00:39:13.934 --> 00:39:15.567

00:39:15.567 --> 00:39:17.467
THE WORLD DOESN'T WANT
TO GO ON

00:39:17.467 --> 00:39:19.300
TO THE NEXT THING
IN THE SHOW.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:22.234

AND IT'S NOT.

00:39:30.834 --> 00:39:32.934
YOU CAN'T END THIS NOW.

OTHER WORLDS THAT HAVE TO GO.

IS THE BEST WORLD.

SHUT YOU DOWN.

[laughter]

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.400
Pausch: IT WAS
AN UNUSUAL COURSE

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.167
WITH SOME OF THE MOST BRILLIANT,
CREATIVE STUDENTS

00:41:24.167 --> 00:41:26.701
FROM ALL ACROSS
THE CAMPUS.

00:41:26.701 --> 00:41:29.267
IT JUST WAS A JOY
TO BE INVOLVED.

00:41:29.267 --> 00:41:31.601
AND THEY TOOK THE WHOLE STAGE
PERFORMANCE ASPECT OF THIS

00:41:31.601 --> 00:41:33.133
WAY TOO SERIOUSLY.

00:41:33.133 --> 00:41:36.334
[laughter]

00:41:36.334 --> 00:41:39.234
AND IT BECAME THIS
CAMPUS PHENOMENON EVERY YEAR.

00:41:39.234 --> 00:41:41.400
PEOPLE WOULD LINE UP FOR IT.

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.334
IT WAS VERY FLATTERING,

00:41:43.334 --> 00:41:47.067
AND IT GAVE KIDS
A SENSE OF EXCITEMENT

00:41:47.067 --> 00:41:50.701
OF PUTTING ON A SHOW FOR PEOPLE
WHO WERE THEN EXCITED ABOUT IT,

00:41:50.701 --> 00:41:52.467
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S
ONE OF THE BEST THINGS

00:41:52.467 --> 00:41:53.767
YOU CAN GIVE SOMEBODY,

00:41:53.767 --> 00:41:56.334
THE CHANCE TO SHOW THEM
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE

00:41:56.334 --> 00:41:58.634
TO MAKE OTHER PEOPLE
GET EXCITED AND HAPPY.

00:41:58.634 --> 00:42:00.367
I MEAN,
THAT'S A TREMENDOUS GIFT.

00:42:00.367 --> 00:42:02.234
WE ALWAYS TRIED
TO INVOLVE THE AUDIENCE,

00:42:02.234 --> 00:42:03.767
WHETHER IT WAS PEOPLE
WITH GLOW STICKS

00:42:03.767 --> 00:42:07.133
OR BATTING A BEACH BALL AROUND
OR DRIVING.

00:42:07.133 --> 00:42:08.167
THIS IS REALLY COOL.

00:42:08.167 --> 00:42:09.601
THIS TECHNOLOGY
ACTUALLY GOT USED

00:42:09.601 --> 00:42:11.567
AT THE "SPIDERMAN 3" PREMIERE
IN L.A.

00:42:11.567 --> 00:42:13.834
SO THE AUDIENCE WAS CONTROLLING
SOMETHING ON THE SCREEN,

00:42:13.834 --> 00:42:16.501
SO THAT'S KIND OF NICE.

00:42:16.501 --> 00:42:18.901
AND I DON'T HAVE A CLASS PICTURE
FROM EVERY YEAR,

00:42:18.901 --> 00:42:20.667
BUT I DREDGED ALL THE ONES
THAT I DO HAVE,

00:42:20.667 --> 00:42:22.968
AND ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT
WHAT A PRIVILEGE

00:42:22.968 --> 00:42:24.701
AND AN HONOR IT WAS
TO TEACH THAT COURSE

00:42:24.701 --> 00:42:26.534
FOR SOMETHING LIKE TEN YEARS,

00:42:26.534 --> 00:42:30.734
AND ALL GOOD THINGS
COME TO AN END,

00:42:30.734 --> 00:42:34.567
AND I STOPPED TEACHING
THAT COURSE ABOUT A YEAR AGO.

00:42:34.567 --> 00:42:36.501
PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME
WHAT WAS MY FAVORITE MOMENT.

00:42:36.501 --> 00:42:38.868
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COULD HAVE
A FAVORITE MOMENT,

00:42:38.868 --> 00:42:41.767
BUT, BOY, THERE IS ONE
I'LL NEVER FORGET.

00:42:41.767 --> 00:42:46.234
THIS WAS A WORLD WITH, I BELIEVE
A ROLLER-SKATING NINJA,

00:42:46.234 --> 00:42:48.501
AND ONE OF THE RULES WAS THAT
WE PERFORM THESE THINGS LIVE,

00:42:48.501 --> 00:42:49.801
AND THEY ALL HAD TO REALLY WORK,

00:42:49.801 --> 00:42:51.200
AND THE MOMENT
IT STOPPED WORKING,

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.734
WE WENT TO
YOUR BACKUP VIDEOTAPE,

00:42:52.734 --> 00:42:54.901
AND THIS WAS VERY EMBARRASSING.

00:42:54.901 --> 00:42:56.767
SO WE HAVE THIS NINJA ON STAGE,

00:42:56.767 --> 00:42:58.467
AND HE'S DOING
THIS ROLLER-SKATING THING,

00:42:58.467 --> 00:43:00.834
AND THE WORLD,
IT DID NOT CRASH GENTLY.

00:43:00.834 --> 00:43:02.200
WHOOSH.

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.534
AND I COME OUT,

00:43:03.534 --> 00:43:05.400
AND I BELIEVE
IT WAS STEVE AUDIA, WASN'T IT?

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:07.200
WHERE IS HE?

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.601
OKAY, WHERE IS STEVE?

00:43:08.601 --> 00:43:10.200
AH, MY MAN, STEVE AUDIA.

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:13.467
AND TALK ABOUT
QUICK ON YOUR FEET, ALL RIGHT?

00:43:13.467 --> 00:43:16.267
I SAY, "STEVE, I'M SORRY,
BUT YOUR WORLD HAS CRASHED,

00:43:16.267 --> 00:43:19.000
AND WE'RE GOING TO GO
TO VIDEOTAPE."

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.367
AND HE PULLS OUT HIS NINJA SWORD
AND SAYS,

00:43:22.367 --> 00:43:23.734
"I AM DISHONORED!
WHA!"

00:43:23.734 --> 00:43:25.267
AND JUST DROPS.

00:43:25.267 --> 00:43:28.200
[laughter and applause]

00:43:35.734 --> 00:43:37.100
AND SO I THINK
IT'S VERY TELLING

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:38.267
THAT MY FAVORITE MOMENT

00:43:38.267 --> 00:43:40.067
IN TEN YEARS
OF THIS HIGH-TECHNOLOGY COURSE

00:43:40.067 --> 00:43:42.200
WAS A BRILLIANT AD-LIB.

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.834
AND THEN WHEN THE VIDEOTAPE
IS DONE AND THE LIGHTS COME UP,

00:43:44.834 --> 00:43:49.534
HE'S LYING THERE LIFELESS,
AND HIS TEAMMATES DRAG HIM OFF.

00:43:49.534 --> 00:43:54.467
IT WAS REALLY
A FANTASTIC MOMENT.

00:43:54.467 --> 00:43:56.634
AND THE COURSE
WAS ALL ABOUT BONDING.

00:43:56.634 --> 00:43:57.834
PEOPLE USED TO SAY,
YOU KNOW,

00:43:57.834 --> 00:43:59.400
"WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE
FOR A GOOD WORLD?"

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:00.968
I SAID, "I CAN'T
TELL YOU BEFOREHAND,

00:44:00.968 --> 00:44:02.400
"BUT RIGHT BEFORE
THEY PRESENT IT,

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.734
"I CAN TELL YOU
IF THE WORLD'S GOOD

00:44:03.734 --> 00:44:05.000
"JUST BY THE BODY LANGUAGE.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.667
"IF THEY'RE STANDING
CLOSE TO EACH OTHER,

00:44:06.667 --> 00:44:08.968
THE WORLD IS GOOD."

00:44:08.968 --> 00:44:12.234
AND BVW
WAS A PIONEERING COURSE.

00:44:16.801 --> 00:44:19.334
I WON'T BORE YOU
WITH ALL THE DETAILS,

00:44:19.334 --> 00:44:22.767
BUT IT WASN'T EASY TO DO,

00:44:22.767 --> 00:44:25.634
AND I WAS GIVEN THIS WHEN
I STEPPED DOWN FROM THE ETC,

00:44:25.634 --> 00:44:27.234
AND I THINK IT'S EMBLEMATIC.

00:44:27.234 --> 00:44:29.167
IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO ANYTHING
THAT'S PIONEERING,

00:44:29.167 --> 00:44:30.834
YOU WILL GET THOSE ARROWS
IN THE BACK,

00:44:30.834 --> 00:44:32.200
AND YOU JUST HAVE
TO PUT UP WITH IT.

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.234
I MEAN, EVERYTHING THAT
COULD GO WRONG DID GO WRONG,

00:44:34.234 --> 00:44:35.834
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,

00:44:35.834 --> 00:44:40.033
A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE
HAD A WHOLE LOT OF FUN.

00:44:40.033 --> 00:44:41.434
WHEN YOU'VE HAD SOMETHING FOR

00:44:41.434 --> 00:44:44.133
TEN YEARS THAT YOU HOLD
SO PRECIOUS,

00:44:44.133 --> 00:44:45.567
IT'S THE TOUGHEST THING
IN THE WORLD

00:44:45.567 --> 00:44:47.434
TO HAND IT OVER,

00:44:47.434 --> 00:44:48.868
AND THE ONLY ADVICE
I CAN GIVE YOU IS,

00:44:48.868 --> 00:44:52.067
FIND SOMEBODY BETTER THAN YOU
TO HAND IT TO,

00:44:52.067 --> 00:44:53.434
AND THAT'S WHAT I DID.

00:44:53.434 --> 00:44:57.834
THERE WAS THIS KID
AT THE VR STUDIO WAY BACK WHEN,

00:44:57.834 --> 00:44:59.334
AND YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO SPEND VERY LONG

00:44:59.334 --> 00:45:01.801
IN JESSE SCHELL'S ORBIT TO GO,

00:45:01.801 --> 00:45:04.934
"THE FORCE IS STRONG
IN THIS ONE."

00:45:04.934 --> 00:45:06.667
AND ONE OF MY GREATEST--

00:45:06.667 --> 00:45:09.100
MY TWO GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENTS,
I THINK, FOR CARNEGIE MELLON

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:10.934
WERE THAT I GOT JESSICA HODGINS
AND JESSE SCHELL

00:45:10.934 --> 00:45:12.334
TO COME HERE
AND JOIN OUR FACULTY,

00:45:12.334 --> 00:45:14.501
AND I WAS THRILLED WHEN
I COULD HAND THIS OVER TO JESSE,

00:45:14.501 --> 00:45:16.133
AND TO NO ONE'S SURPRISE,

00:45:16.133 --> 00:45:18.234
HE HAS REALLY TAKEN IT UP
TO THE NEXT NOTCH,

00:45:18.234 --> 00:45:21.501
AND THE COURSE IS
IN MORE-THAN-GOOD HANDS.

00:45:21.501 --> 00:45:24.367
IT'S IN BETTER HANDS.

00:45:24.367 --> 00:45:26.601
BUT IT WAS JUST ONE COURSE,

00:45:26.601 --> 00:45:29.167
AND THEN WE REALLY TOOK IT
UP A NOTCH,

00:45:29.167 --> 00:45:34.200
AND WE CREATED WHAT I WOULD CALL
THE DREAM FULFILLMENT FACTORY.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.834
DON MARINELLI AND I
GOT TOGETHER,

00:45:36.834 --> 00:45:39.634
AND WITH THE UNIVERSITY'S
BLESSING AND ENCOURAGEMENT,

00:45:39.634 --> 00:45:42.100
WE MADE THIS THING
OUT OF WHOLE CLOTH

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:43.834
THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY INSANE,

00:45:43.834 --> 00:45:45.901
SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN TRIED.

00:45:45.901 --> 00:45:50.801
ALL THE SANE UNIVERSITIES DIDN'T
GO NEAR THIS KIND OF STUFF,

00:45:50.801 --> 00:45:55.367
CREATING A TREMENDOUS
OPPORTUNISTIC VOID.

00:45:55.367 --> 00:45:57.000
SO THE ENTERTAINMENT
TECHNOLOGY CENTER

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.601
WAS ALL ABOUT ARTISTS
AND TECHNOLOGISTS

00:45:58.601 --> 00:46:00.834
WORKING IN SMALL TEAMS
TO MAKE THINGS.

00:46:00.834 --> 00:46:03.200
IT WAS A TWO-YEAR PROFESSIONAL
MASTER'S DEGREE,

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:06.100
AND DON AND I WERE
TWO KINDRED SPIRITS.

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:07.234
WE'RE VERY DIFFERENT.

00:46:07.234 --> 00:46:08.267
ANYBODY WHO KNOWS US KNOWS

00:46:08.267 --> 00:46:11.267
THAT WE ARE
VERY DIFFERENT PEOPLE,

00:46:11.267 --> 00:46:13.367
AND WE LIKED TO DO THINGS
IN A NEW WAY,

00:46:13.367 --> 00:46:14.734
AND THE TRUTH
OF THE MATTER IS

00:46:14.734 --> 00:46:17.033
THAT WE ARE BOTH A LITTLE
UNCOMFORTABLE IN ACADEMIA.

00:46:17.033 --> 00:46:18.968
I USED TO SAY THAT I AM
UNCOMFORTABLE AS AN ACADEMIC

00:46:18.968 --> 00:46:20.501
BECAUSE I COME FROM A LONG LINE
OF PEOPLE

00:46:20.501 --> 00:46:25.634
WHO ACTUALLY WORKED
FOR A LIVING, SO...

00:46:25.634 --> 00:46:27.834
[laughter]

00:46:27.834 --> 00:46:31.434
I DETECT NERVOUS LAUGHTER.

00:46:31.434 --> 00:46:32.968
AND I WANT TO STRESS,
CARNEGIE MELLON

00:46:32.968 --> 00:46:34.234
IS THE ONLY PLACE
IN THE WORLD

00:46:34.234 --> 00:46:35.868
THAT THE ETC
COULD HAVE HAPPENED,

00:46:35.868 --> 00:46:37.801
BY FAR THE ONLY PLACE.

00:46:41.367 --> 00:46:46.367
OKAY, THIS PICTURE
WAS DON'S IDEA, OKAY?

00:46:46.367 --> 00:46:47.868
AND WE LIKE TO REFER
TO THIS PICTURE

00:46:47.868 --> 00:46:54.033
AS DON MARINELLI ON GUITAR
AND RANDY PAUSCH ON KEYBOARDS.

00:46:54.033 --> 00:46:56.100
BUT WE REALLY DID PLAY UP
THE LEFT BRAIN, RIGHT BRAIN,

00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:57.868
AND IT WORKED OUT REALLY WELL
THAT WAY.

00:46:57.868 --> 00:47:01.467
DON IS AN INTENSE GUY.

00:47:01.467 --> 00:47:04.400
[laughter and applause]

00:47:07.567 --> 00:47:11.434
AND DON AND I SHARED AN OFFICE,

00:47:11.434 --> 00:47:13.634
AND AT FIRST
IT WAS A SMALL OFFICE.

00:47:13.634 --> 00:47:18.067
WE SHARED AN OFFICE
FOR SIX YEARS, ALL RIGHT?

00:47:18.067 --> 00:47:21.801
NOW, THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW DON
KNOW HE'S AN INTENSE GUY,

00:47:21.801 --> 00:47:23.634
AND, YOU KNOW,
GIVEN MY CURRENT CONDITION,

00:47:23.634 --> 00:47:25.968
SOMEBODY WAS ASKING ME--
THIS IS A TERRIBLE JOKE,

00:47:25.968 --> 00:47:28.634
BUT I'M GOING TO USE IT ANYWAY,

00:47:28.634 --> 00:47:30.400
BECAUSE I KNOW DON
WILL FORGIVE ME.

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.300
SOMEBODY SAID,
"GIVEN YOUR CURRENT CONDITION,

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:33.567
"HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT

00:47:33.567 --> 00:47:35.834
WHETHER YOU'RE GONNA GO
TO HEAVEN OR HELL?"

00:47:35.834 --> 00:47:37.834
AND I SAID, "I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IF I'M GOING TO HELL,

00:47:37.834 --> 00:47:41.734
I'M DUE SIX YEARS
FOR TIME SERVED."

00:47:41.734 --> 00:47:43.501
I KID.

00:47:43.501 --> 00:47:45.067
SHARING AN OFFICE WITH DON

00:47:45.067 --> 00:47:48.067
WAS REALLY LIKE SHARING
AN OFFICE WITH A TORNADO.

00:47:48.067 --> 00:47:49.367
THERE WAS JUST SO MUCH ENERGY,

00:47:49.367 --> 00:47:53.067
AND YOU NEVER KNEW
WHICH TRAILER WAS NEXT, RIGHT?

00:47:53.067 --> 00:47:56.801
BUT YOU KNEW SOMETHING EXCITING
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN,

00:47:56.801 --> 00:47:59.133
AND THERE WAS SO MUCH ENERGY,

00:47:59.133 --> 00:48:02.100
AND I DO BELIEVE IN GIVING
CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE.

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:04.667
SO IN MY TYPICALLY VISUAL WAY,

00:48:04.667 --> 00:48:07.501
IF DON AND I WERE TO SPLIT
THE SUCCESS FOR THE ETC,

00:48:07.501 --> 00:48:09.000
HE CLEARLY GETS
THE LION'S SHARE OF IT.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.167
HE DID THE LION'S SHARE
OF THE WORK, OKAY.

00:48:11.167 --> 00:48:12.901
HE HAD THE LION'S SHARE
OF THE IDEAS.

00:48:12.901 --> 00:48:14.033
IT WAS A GREAT TEAMWORK.

00:48:14.033 --> 00:48:15.667
I THINK IT WAS A GREAT YIN
AND A YANG,

00:48:15.667 --> 00:48:19.234
BUT IT WAS MORE LIKE "YIN"
AND YANG.

00:48:19.234 --> 00:48:21.167
AND HE DESERVES THAT CREDIT,
AND I GIVE IT TO HIM,

00:48:21.167 --> 00:48:23.100
BECAUSE THE ETC
IS A WONDERFUL PLACE,

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:26.100
AND HE'S NOW RUNNING IT,
AND HE'S TAKING IT GLOBAL.

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:27.801
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT
IN A SECOND.

00:48:27.801 --> 00:48:29.667
DESCRIBING THE ETC
IS REALLY HARD,

00:48:29.667 --> 00:48:31.334
AND I FINALLY FOUND
A METAPHOR.

00:48:31.334 --> 00:48:33.367
TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT THE ETC

00:48:33.367 --> 00:48:35.067
IS LIKE DESCRIBING
CIRQUE DU SOLEIL

00:48:35.067 --> 00:48:36.400
IF THEY'VE NEVER SEEN IT.

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.334
SOONER OR LATER YOU'RE GOING
TO MAKE THE MISTAKE.

00:48:38.334 --> 00:48:39.701
YOU'RE GOING TO SAY,
"WELL, IT'S LIKE A CIRCUS."

00:48:39.701 --> 00:48:41.133
AND THEN YOU'RE DRAGGED
INTO THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT,

00:48:41.133 --> 00:48:42.601
"OH, HOW MANY TIGERS;
HOW MANY LIONS;

00:48:42.601 --> 00:48:44.801
ALL RIGHT,
HOW MANY TRAPEZE ACTS?"

00:48:44.801 --> 00:48:46.067
AND THAT MISSES THE WHOLE POINT.

00:48:46.067 --> 00:48:47.634
SO WHEN WE SAY WE'RE
A MASTER'S DEGREE,

00:48:47.634 --> 00:48:48.868
WE'RE REALLY NOT LIKE

00:48:48.868 --> 00:48:50.400
ANY MASTER'S DEGREE
YOU'VE EVER SEEN.

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:52.634
HERE'S THE CURRICULUM.

00:48:58.133 --> 00:48:59.934
THE CURRICULUM ENDED UP
LOOKING LIKE THIS.

00:48:59.934 --> 00:49:01.801
ALL I WANT TO DO
IS VISUALLY COMMUNICATE TO YOU

00:49:01.801 --> 00:49:03.968
THAT YOU DO FIVE PROJECTS
IN BUILDING VIRTUAL WORLDS.

00:49:03.968 --> 00:49:05.367
THEN YOU DO THREE MORE.

00:49:05.367 --> 00:49:08.501
ALL OF YOUR TIME IS SPENT
IN SMALL TEAMS MAKING STUFF,

00:49:08.501 --> 00:49:09.901
NONE OF THAT
BOOK-LEARNING THING.

00:49:09.901 --> 00:49:12.033
DON AND I HAD NO PATIENCE
FOR THE BOOK-LEARNING THING.

00:49:12.033 --> 00:49:13.467
IT'S A MASTER'S DEGREE.

00:49:13.467 --> 00:49:15.434
THEY ALREADY SPENT FOUR YEARS
DOING BOOK LEARNING.

00:49:15.434 --> 00:49:20.667
ALL RIGHT, BY NOW THEY SHOULD
HAVE READ ALL THE BOOKS.

00:49:20.667 --> 00:49:21.868
THE KEYS TO SUCCESS

00:49:21.868 --> 00:49:25.634
WERE THAT CARNEGIE MELLON
GAVE US THE REINS,

00:49:25.634 --> 00:49:27.067
COMPLETELY GAVE US THE REINS.

00:49:27.067 --> 00:49:28.501
WE HAD NO DEANS TO REPORT TO.

00:49:28.501 --> 00:49:29.968
WE REPORTED DIRECTLY
TO THE PROVOST,

00:49:29.968 --> 00:49:31.434
WHICH IS GREAT,
BECAUSE THE PROVOST

00:49:31.434 --> 00:49:34.501
IS WAY TOO BUSY
TO WATCH YOU CAREFULLY.

00:49:34.501 --> 00:49:37.067
WE WERE GIVEN EXPLICIT LICENSE
TO BREAK THE MOLD.

00:49:37.067 --> 00:49:38.334
IT WAS ALL PROJECT BASED.

00:49:38.334 --> 00:49:39.334
IT WAS INTENSE.

00:49:39.334 --> 00:49:41.534
IT WAS FUN,
AND WE TOOK FIELD TRIPS.

00:49:41.534 --> 00:49:43.534
EVERY SPRING SEMESTER
IN JANUARY,

00:49:43.534 --> 00:49:45.701
WE'D TAKE ALL 50 STUDENTS
IN THE FIRST-YEAR CLASS,

00:49:45.701 --> 00:49:47.567
AND WE'D TAKE THEM OUT
TO SHOPS AT PIXAR.

00:49:47.567 --> 00:49:49.534
WE'D TAKE 'EM TO PIXAR,
INDUSTRIAL LIGHT AND MAGIC,

00:49:49.534 --> 00:49:50.901
AND OF COURSE
WHEN YOU'VE GOT GUYS

00:49:50.901 --> 00:49:53.801
LIKE TOMMY THERE ACTING AS HOST,
RIGHT,

00:49:53.801 --> 00:49:56.234
IT'S PRETTY EASY TO GET ENTREE
TO THESE PLACES.

00:49:56.234 --> 00:49:58.968
SO WE DID THINGS VERY,
VERY DIFFERENTLY.

00:49:58.968 --> 00:50:00.601
THE KIND OF PROJECTS
STUDENTS WOULD DO,

00:50:00.601 --> 00:50:03.467
WE DID A LOT OF WHAT WE'D CALL
EDU-TAINMENT.

00:50:03.467 --> 00:50:04.667
WE DEVELOPED
A BUNCH OF THINGS

00:50:04.667 --> 00:50:06.234
WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT
OF NEW YORK,

00:50:06.234 --> 00:50:08.167
A NETWORK SIMULATOR
FOR TRAINING FIREFIGHTERS,

00:50:08.167 --> 00:50:10.167
USING VIDEO GAME-ISH TYPE
TECHNOLOGY

00:50:10.167 --> 00:50:12.133
TO TEACH PEOPLE USEFUL THINGS.

00:50:12.133 --> 00:50:14.334
THAT'S NOT BAD.

00:50:14.334 --> 00:50:15.801
COMPANIES DID
THIS STRANGE THING.

00:50:15.801 --> 00:50:20.467
THEY PUT IN WRITING, "WE PROMISE
TO HIRE YOUR STUDENTS."

00:50:20.467 --> 00:50:22.167
I'VE GOT THE EA
AND ACTIVISION ONES HERE.

00:50:22.167 --> 00:50:25.234
I THINK THERE ARE NOW,
HOW MANY, FIVE?

00:50:25.234 --> 00:50:27.434
DREW KNOWS, I BET.

00:50:27.434 --> 00:50:29.067
SO THERE ARE FIVE
WRITTEN AGREEMENTS.

00:50:29.067 --> 00:50:30.534
I DON'T KNOW OF ANY OTHER SCHOOL

00:50:30.534 --> 00:50:32.734
THAT HAS THIS KIND OF WRITTEN
AGREEMENT WITH ANY COMPANY,

00:50:32.734 --> 00:50:34.267
AND SO THAT'S A REAL STATEMENT.

00:50:34.267 --> 00:50:35.734
AND THESE ARE
MULTIPLE-YEAR THINGS,

00:50:35.734 --> 00:50:37.200
SO THEY'RE AGREEING
TO HIRE PEOPLE

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.834
FOR SUMMER INTERNSHIPS
THAT WE HAVE NOT ADMITTED YET.

00:50:39.834 --> 00:50:41.200
THAT'S A PRETTY STRONG STATEMENT

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:43.167
ABOUT THE QUALITY
OF THE PROGRAM.

00:50:43.167 --> 00:50:45.801
AND DON, AS I SAID, HE'S NOW--
HE'S CRAZY.

00:50:45.801 --> 00:50:48.367
I MEAN THAT IN A WONDERFUL
COMPLIMENTARY WAY.

00:50:48.367 --> 00:50:52.200
HE'S DOING THESE THINGS
WHERE I'M LIKE, "OH, MY GOD."

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:54.734
HE'S NOT HERE TONIGHT,
BECAUSE HE'S IN SINGAPORE,

00:50:54.734 --> 00:50:57.300
BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO BE
AN ETC CAMPUS IN SINGAPORE.

00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:58.734
THERE'S ALREADY ONE
IN AUSTRALIA,

00:50:58.734 --> 00:51:00.167
AND THERE'S GOING TO BE ONE
IN KOREA.

00:51:00.167 --> 00:51:01.901
SO THIS IS BECOMING
A GLOBAL PHENOMENON.

00:51:01.901 --> 00:51:03.501
SO I THINK THIS
REALLY SPEAKS VOLUMES

00:51:03.501 --> 00:51:04.901
ABOUT ALL
THE OTHER UNIVERSITIES.

00:51:04.901 --> 00:51:06.467
IT'S REALLY TRUE
THAT CARNEGIE MELLON

00:51:06.467 --> 00:51:08.067
IS THE ONLY UNIVERSITY
THAT CAN DO THIS.

00:51:08.067 --> 00:51:12.434
WE JUST HAVE TO DO IT
ALL OVER THE WORLD NOW.

00:51:12.434 --> 00:51:14.133
ONE OTHER BIG SUCCESS
ABOUT THE ETC

00:51:14.133 --> 00:51:16.767
IS TEACHING PEOPLE
ABOUT FOCUS--

00:51:16.767 --> 00:51:21.367
OH, I HEAR THE NERVOUS LAUGHTER
FROM THE STUDENTS.

00:51:21.367 --> 00:51:23.367
I HAD FORGOTTEN THE DELAYED
SHOCK THERAPY EFFECT

00:51:23.367 --> 00:51:25.234
OF THESE BAR CHARTS.

00:51:25.234 --> 00:51:27.167
WHEN YOU'RE TAKING
BUILDING VIRTUAL WORLDS,

00:51:27.167 --> 00:51:28.834
EVERY TWO WEEKS
WE GET PEER FEEDBACK.

00:51:28.834 --> 00:51:30.367
WE PUT THAT ALL
INTO A BIG SPREADSHEET,

00:51:30.367 --> 00:51:31.767
AND AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER,

00:51:31.767 --> 00:51:33.501
YOU HAD THREE TEAMMATES
PER PROJECT,

00:51:33.501 --> 00:51:34.567
FIVE PROJECTS.

00:51:34.567 --> 00:51:35.601
THAT'S 15 DATA POINTS.

00:51:35.601 --> 00:51:36.868
THAT'S STATISTICALLY VALID.

00:51:36.868 --> 00:51:39.367
AND YOU GET A BAR CHART
TELLING YOU ON A RANKING

00:51:39.367 --> 00:51:40.634
OF HOW EASY YOU ARE
TO WORK WITH,

00:51:40.634 --> 00:51:43.367
WHERE YOU STACK UP
AGAINST YOUR PEERS.

00:51:43.367 --> 00:51:46.601
BOY, THAT'S HARD FEEDBACK
TO IGNORE.

00:51:46.601 --> 00:51:49.000
SOME STILL MANAGED.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.400
[laughter]

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.501
BUT FOR THE MOST PART,
PEOPLE LOOKED AT THAT AND WENT,

00:51:54.501 --> 00:51:56.634
"WOW, I'VE GOT TO PICK IT UP
A NOTCH.

00:51:56.634 --> 00:51:58.467
"I BETTER START THINKING ABOUT
WHAT I'M SAYING

00:51:58.467 --> 00:51:59.701
TO PEOPLE IN THESE MEETINGS."

00:51:59.701 --> 00:52:02.400
AND THAT IS THE BEST GIFT
AN EDUCATOR CAN GIVE

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:05.467
IS TO GET SOMEBODY
TO BECOME SELF-REFLECTIVE.

00:52:05.467 --> 00:52:06.901
SO THE ETC WAS WONDERFUL,

00:52:06.901 --> 00:52:10.601
BUT EVEN THE ETC AND EVEN AS DON
SCALES IT AROUND THE GLOBE,

00:52:10.601 --> 00:52:14.200
IT'S STILL VERY LABOR INTENSIVE,
YOU KNOW.

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:15.634
IT'S NOT TOMMY
ONE AT A TIME.

00:52:15.634 --> 00:52:18.167
IT'S NOT A RESEARCH GROUP
TEN AT A TIME.

00:52:18.167 --> 00:52:21.834
IT'S 50 OR 100 AT A TIME
PER CAMPUS TIMES FOUR CAMPUSES.

00:52:21.834 --> 00:52:25.734
BUT I WANTED SOMETHING
INFINITELY SCALABLE, ALL RIGHT?

00:52:25.734 --> 00:52:27.400
SCALABLE TO THE POINT
WHERE MILLIONS

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.234
OR TENS OF MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE

00:52:29.234 --> 00:52:31.734
COULD CHASE THEIR DREAMS
WITH SOMETHING.

00:52:31.734 --> 00:52:33.934
AND, YOU KNOW,
I GUESS THAT KIND OF A GOAL

00:52:33.934 --> 00:52:37.067
REALLY DOES MAKE ME
THE MAD HATTER.

00:52:37.067 --> 00:52:42.801
SO ALICE IS A PROJECT THAT WE'VE
WORKED ON FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

00:52:42.801 --> 00:52:45.968
IT'S A NOVEL WAY
TO TEACH COMPUTER PROGRAMMING.

00:52:45.968 --> 00:52:47.400
KIDS MAKE MOVIES AND GAMES,

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:49.601
THE HEAD FAKE--AGAIN,
WE'RE BACK TO THE HEAD FAKES.

00:52:49.601 --> 00:52:51.434
THE BEST WAY
TO TEACH SOMEBODY SOMETHING

00:52:51.434 --> 00:52:54.100
IS TO HAVE THEM THINK
THEY'RE LEARNING SOMETHING ELSE.

00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:55.667
I'VE DONE IT MY WHOLE CAREER.

00:52:55.667 --> 00:52:57.934
AND THE HEAD FAKE HERE IS THAT
THEY'RE LEARNING TO PROGRAM,

00:52:57.934 --> 00:53:00.200
BUT THEY JUST THINK THEY'RE
MAKING MOVIES AND VIDEO GAMES.

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.834
THIS THING
HAS ALREADY BEEN DOWNLOADED

00:53:01.834 --> 00:53:03.234
WELL OVER A MILLION TIMES.

00:53:03.234 --> 00:53:05.534
THERE ARE EIGHT TEXTBOOKS
THAT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT IT.

00:53:05.534 --> 00:53:07.367
10% OF U.S. COLLEGES
ARE USING IT NOW,

00:53:07.367 --> 00:53:09.467
AND IT'S NOT THE GOOD STUFF YET.

00:53:09.467 --> 00:53:14.367
THE GOOD STUFF IS COMING
IN THE NEXT VERSION.

00:53:14.367 --> 00:53:16.868
I, LIKE MOSES, GET TO SEE
THE PROMISED LAND,

00:53:16.868 --> 00:53:19.667
BUT I WON'T GET
TO SET FOOT IN IT,

00:53:19.667 --> 00:53:22.667
AND THAT'S OKAY,
BECAUSE I CAN SEE IT,

00:53:22.667 --> 00:53:25.300
AND THE VISION IS CLEAR:

00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:30.067
MILLIONS OF KIDS HAVING FUN
WHILE LEARNING SOMETHING HARD.

00:53:30.067 --> 00:53:32.000
THAT'S PRETTY COOL.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.200
I CAN DEAL WITH THAT
AS A LEGACY.

00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:35.968
THE NEXT VERSION'S
GOING TO COME OUT IN 2008.

00:53:35.968 --> 00:53:37.667
IT'S GOING TO BE TEACHING
THE JAVA LANGUAGE

00:53:37.667 --> 00:53:39.501
IF YOU WANT THEM TO KNOW
THEY'RE LEARNING JAVA.

00:53:39.501 --> 00:53:40.701
OTHERWISE THEY'LL JUST THINK

00:53:40.701 --> 00:53:42.534
THAT THEY'RE WRITING
MOVIE SCRIPTS.

00:53:42.534 --> 00:53:45.734
AND WE'RE GETTING THE CHARACTERS

00:53:45.734 --> 00:53:48.834
FROM THE BEST-SELLING PC GAME
IN HISTORY, "THE SIMS."

00:53:48.834 --> 00:53:50.901
AND THIS IS ALL ALREADY
WORKING IN THE LAB,

00:53:50.901 --> 00:53:53.367
SO THERE'S NO REAL
TECHNOLOGICAL RISK.

00:53:53.367 --> 00:53:55.367
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO THANK
AND MENTION EVERYBODY

00:53:55.367 --> 00:53:56.601
IN THE ALICE TEAM,

00:53:56.601 --> 00:53:58.334
BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT
DENNIS COSGROVE

00:53:58.334 --> 00:54:00.367
IS GOING TO BE BUILDING THIS,
HAS BEEN BUILDING THIS.

00:54:00.367 --> 00:54:01.868
HE IS THE DESIGNER.

00:54:01.868 --> 00:54:05.167
IT'S HIS BABY, AND FOR
THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE WONDERING,

00:54:05.167 --> 00:54:07.033
"WELL, YOU KNOW,
IN SOME NUMBER OF MONTHS,

00:54:07.033 --> 00:54:09.033
WHO SHOULD I BE EMAILING
ABOUT THE ALICE PROJECT,"

00:54:09.033 --> 00:54:11.634
WHERE'S WANDA DANN?

00:54:11.634 --> 00:54:12.767
OH, THERE YOU ARE.

00:54:12.767 --> 00:54:14.968
STAND UP,
LET THEM ALL SEE YOU.

00:54:14.968 --> 00:54:16.467
EVERYBODY SAY,
"HI, WANDA."

00:54:16.467 --> 00:54:18.434
all: HI, WANDA.

00:54:18.434 --> 00:54:21.167
Pausch: SEND HER THE EMAIL.

00:54:21.167 --> 00:54:23.300
AND I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE
ABOUT CAITLIN KELLEHER,

00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:25.267
BUT SHE'S GRADUATED
WITH HER PhD

00:54:25.267 --> 00:54:26.834
AND IS AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,

00:54:26.834 --> 00:54:28.501
AND SHE'S GOING
TO BE TAKING THIS UP A NOTCH

00:54:28.501 --> 00:54:30.200
AND GOING TO MIDDLE SCHOOLS
WITH IT.

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:33.801
SO GRAND VISION,
AND TO THE EXTENT

00:54:33.801 --> 00:54:35.300
THAT YOU CAN LIVE ON
IN SOMETHING,

00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:37.767
I WILL LIVE ON IN ALICE.

00:54:37.767 --> 00:54:39.501
ALL RIGHT, SO NOW THE THIRD PART
OF THE TALK,

00:54:39.501 --> 00:54:40.834
LESSONS LEARNED.

00:54:40.834 --> 00:54:42.367
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT MY DREAMS.

00:54:42.367 --> 00:54:45.033
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HELPING OTHER
PEOPLE ENABLE THEIR DREAMS.

00:54:45.033 --> 00:54:46.300
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY,

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:47.601
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME ASPECT

00:54:47.601 --> 00:54:51.334
OF WHAT LETS YOU GET
TO ACHIEVE YOUR DREAMS.

00:54:51.334 --> 00:54:54.734
FIRST ONE IS THE ROLE OF
PARENTS, MENTORS, AND STUDENTS.

00:54:54.734 --> 00:54:59.868
I WAS BLESSED TO HAVE BEEN BORN
TO TWO INCREDIBLE PEOPLE.

00:54:59.868 --> 00:55:04.234
THIS IS MY MOTHER
ON HER 70TH BIRTHDAY.

00:55:04.234 --> 00:55:05.734
I AM BACK HERE.

00:55:05.734 --> 00:55:09.467
I HAVE JUST BEEN LAPPED.

00:55:09.467 --> 00:55:13.934
THIS IS MY DAD RIDING A ROLLER
COASTER ON HIS 80TH BIRTHDAY,

00:55:13.934 --> 00:55:17.167
AND HE POINTS OUT THAT,
YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT ONLY BRAVE;

00:55:17.167 --> 00:55:18.567
HE'S TALENTED,

00:55:18.567 --> 00:55:21.934
BECAUSE HE DID WIN THAT BIG BEAR
THE SAME DAY.

00:55:21.934 --> 00:55:25.868
MY DAD WAS SO FULL OF LIFE.

00:55:25.868 --> 00:55:27.467
ANYTHING WITH HIM
WAS AN ADVENTURE.

00:55:27.467 --> 00:55:31.267
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THAT BAG,
BUT I KNOW IT'S COOL.

00:55:31.267 --> 00:55:34.501
MY DAD DRESSED UP
AS SANTA CLAUS,

00:55:34.501 --> 00:55:39.000
BUT HE ALSO DID VERY,
VERY SIGNIFICANT THINGS

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.601
TO HELP LOTS OF PEOPLE.

00:55:40.601 --> 00:55:44.200
THIS IS A DORMITORY IN THAILAND
THAT MY MOM AND DAD UNDERWROTE,

00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:47.467
AND EVERY YEAR, ABOUT
30 STUDENTS GET TO GO TO SCHOOL

00:55:47.467 --> 00:55:48.734
WHO WOULDN'T HAVE OTHERWISE.

00:55:48.734 --> 00:55:50.000
THIS IS SOMETHING

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.901
MY WIFE AND I HAVE
ALSO BEEN INVOLVED IN HEAVILY,

00:55:51.901 --> 00:55:53.400
AND THESE ARE
THE KIND OF THINGS

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:56.834
THAT I THINK EVERYBODY OUGHT
TO BE DOING, HELPING OTHERS.

00:55:56.834 --> 00:55:59.167
BUT THE BEST STORY
I HAVE ABOUT MY DAD IS--

00:55:59.167 --> 00:56:00.601
UNFORTUNATELY
MY DAD PASSED AWAY

00:56:00.601 --> 00:56:01.901
A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO,

00:56:01.901 --> 00:56:03.701
AND WHEN WE WERE GOING
THROUGH HIS THINGS--

00:56:03.701 --> 00:56:05.901
HE HAD FOUGHT IN WORLD WAR II
IN THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE--

00:56:05.901 --> 00:56:07.634
AND WHEN WE WERE GOING
THROUGH HIS THINGS,

00:56:07.634 --> 00:56:11.868
WE FOUND OUT HE HAD BEEN AWARDED
THE BRONZE STAR FOR VALOR.

00:56:11.868 --> 00:56:13.701
MY MOM DIDN'T KNOW IT.

00:56:13.701 --> 00:56:20.200
IN 50 YEARS OF MARRIAGE,
IT HAD JUST NEVER COME UP.

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:21.634
MY MOM.

00:56:21.634 --> 00:56:26.167
MOTHERS ARE PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU
EVEN WHEN YOU PULL THEIR HAIR.

00:56:26.167 --> 00:56:28.267
AND I HAVE TWO
GREAT MOM STORIES.

00:56:28.267 --> 00:56:30.434
WHEN I WAS HERE STUDYING
TO GET MY PhD

00:56:30.434 --> 00:56:33.334
AND I WAS TAKING SOMETHING
CALLED THE THEORY QUALIFIER,

00:56:33.334 --> 00:56:34.968
WHICH I CAN DEFINITIVELY SAY

00:56:34.968 --> 00:56:38.367
IS THE SECOND WORST THING
IN MY LIFE AFTER CHEMOTHERAPY...

00:56:38.367 --> 00:56:41.734
[laughter]

00:56:41.734 --> 00:56:43.534
AND I WAS COMPLAINING
TO MY MOTHER

00:56:43.534 --> 00:56:45.200
ABOUT HOW HARD
THIS TEST WAS

00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:47.767
AND HOW AWFUL IT WAS,
AND SHE JUST LEANED OVER,

00:56:47.767 --> 00:56:49.367
AND SHE PATTED ME ON THE ARM,
AND SHE SAID,

00:56:49.367 --> 00:56:51.567
"WE KNOW HOW YOU FEEL, HONEY,
AND REMEMBER,

00:56:51.567 --> 00:56:54.334
WHEN YOUR FATHER WAS YOUR AGE,
HE WAS FIGHTING THE GERMANS."

00:56:54.334 --> 00:56:57.267
[laughter]

00:57:01.667 --> 00:57:04.234
AFTER I GOT MY PhD,
MY MOTHER TOOK GREAT RELISH

00:57:04.234 --> 00:57:06.033
IN INTRODUCING ME AS,
"THIS IS MY SON.

00:57:06.033 --> 00:57:08.734
HE'S A DOCTOR BUT NOT THE KIND
WHO HELPS PEOPLE."

00:57:08.734 --> 00:57:11.667
[laughter]

00:57:14.133 --> 00:57:15.634
THESE SLIDES
ARE A LITTLE BIT DARK,

00:57:15.634 --> 00:57:17.934
BUT WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL,
I DECIDED TO PAINT MY BEDROOM.

00:57:17.934 --> 00:57:21.667
I'D ALWAYS WANTED A SUBMARINE
AND AN ELEVATOR.

00:57:21.667 --> 00:57:23.834
AND THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS--

00:57:23.834 --> 00:57:26.767
[laughter]

00:57:29.434 --> 00:57:31.868
WHAT CAN I SAY?

00:57:31.868 --> 00:57:33.267
AND THE GREAT THING
ABOUT THIS IS,

00:57:33.267 --> 00:57:35.000
THEY LET ME DO IT,

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.501
AND THEY DIDN'T
GET UPSET ABOUT IT,

00:57:36.501 --> 00:57:38.167
AND IT'S STILL THERE.

00:57:38.167 --> 00:57:40.567
IF YOU GO TO MY PARENT'S HOUSE,
IT'S STILL THERE.

00:57:40.567 --> 00:57:42.434
AND ANYBODY WHO IS OUT THERE
WHO IS A PARENT,

00:57:42.434 --> 00:57:44.767
IF YOUR KIDS WANT TO PAINT
THEIR BEDROOM,

00:57:44.767 --> 00:57:47.200
AS A FAVOR TO ME,
LET THEM DO IT, OKAY?

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:48.934
IT'LL BE OKAY.

00:57:48.934 --> 00:57:52.634
DON'T WORRY ABOUT RESALE VALUE
ON THE HOUSE.

00:57:52.634 --> 00:57:55.667
OTHER PEOPLE WHO HELP US BESIDES
OUR PARENTS: OUR TEACHERS,

00:57:55.667 --> 00:57:58.601
OUR MENTORS, OUR FRIENDS,
OUR COLLEAGUES.

00:57:58.601 --> 00:58:02.400
GOD, WHAT IS THERE TO SAY
ABOUT ANDY VAN DAM?

00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:04.701
WHEN I WAS A FRESHMAN AT BROWN,
HE WAS ON LEAVE,

00:58:04.701 --> 00:58:07.200
AND ALL I HEARD ABOUT
WAS THIS ANDY VAN DAM.

00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:10.100
HE WAS LIKE A MYTHICAL CREATURE,
LIKE A CENTAUR,

00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:13.067
BUT LIKE
A REALLY PISSED OFF CENTAUR,

00:58:13.067 --> 00:58:15.667
AND EVERYBODY WAS, LIKE,
REALLY SAD

00:58:15.667 --> 00:58:20.834
THAT HE WAS GONE
BUT KIND OF MORE RELAXED,

00:58:20.834 --> 00:58:22.000
AND I FOUND OUT WHY,

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.767
BECAUSE I STARTED WORKING
FOR ANDY.

00:58:23.767 --> 00:58:25.701
I WAS A TEACHING ASSISTANT
FOR HIM AS A SOPHOMORE,

00:58:25.701 --> 00:58:27.868
AND I WAS QUITE
AN ARROGANT YOUNG MAN,

00:58:27.868 --> 00:58:30.968
AND I CAME IN
TO SOME OFFICE HOURS,

00:58:30.968 --> 00:58:32.300
AND OF COURSE IT WAS 9:00
AT NIGHT,

00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:33.701
AND ANDY WAS THERE
AT OFFICE HOURS,

00:58:33.701 --> 00:58:34.801
WHICH IS YOUR FIRST CLUE

00:58:34.801 --> 00:58:36.634
AS TO WHAT KIND OF PROFESSOR
HE WAS.

00:58:36.634 --> 00:58:38.701
AND I COME BOUNDING IN,
AND, YOU KNOW,

00:58:38.701 --> 00:58:40.267
I'M JUST--I'M GOING
TO SAVE THE WORLD.

00:58:40.267 --> 00:58:41.934
THERE'RE ALL THESE KIDS
WAITING FOR HELP,

00:58:41.934 --> 00:58:43.501
DA DA, DA DA, DA DA,
DA DA.

00:58:43.501 --> 00:58:46.133
AND AFTERWARDS, ANDY LITERALLY
DUTCH-UNCLED--HE'S DUTCH, RIGHT?

00:58:46.133 --> 00:58:47.267
HE DUTCH-UNCLED ME,

00:58:47.267 --> 00:58:48.801
AND HE PUT HIS ARM
AROUND MY SHOULDERS,

00:58:48.801 --> 00:58:49.968
AND WE WENT FOR A LITTLE WALK,

00:58:49.968 --> 00:58:53.367
AND HE SAID, "RANDY,
IT'S SUCH A SHAME

00:58:53.367 --> 00:58:58.367
"THAT PEOPLE PERCEIVE YOU
AS SO ARROGANT,

00:58:58.367 --> 00:59:00.868
"BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO LIMIT

00:59:00.868 --> 00:59:04.701
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE
TO ACCOMPLISH IN LIFE."

00:59:04.701 --> 00:59:08.667
WHAT A HELL OF A GOOD WAY
TO WORD "YOU'RE BEING A JERK."

00:59:08.667 --> 00:59:09.968
RIGHT?

00:59:09.968 --> 00:59:11.300
HE DOESN'T SAY,
"YOU'RE A JERK."

00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:13.100
HE SAYS, "PEOPLE ARE PERCEIVING
YOU THIS WAY,"

00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:15.033
AND HE SAYS, "THE DOWNSIDE IS,
IT'S GOING TO LIMIT

00:59:15.033 --> 00:59:17.400
WHAT YOU'RE GOING
TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH."

00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:20.901
WHEN I GOT TO KNOW ANDY BETTER,
THE BEATINGS BECAME MORE DIRECT.

00:59:20.901 --> 00:59:24.701
[laughter]

00:59:24.701 --> 00:59:26.434
I COULD TELL YOU ANDY STORIES
FOR A MONTH,

00:59:26.434 --> 00:59:28.801
BUT THE ONE I WILL TELL YOU
IS THAT WHEN IT CAME TIME

00:59:28.801 --> 00:59:30.133
TO START THINKING
ABOUT WHAT TO DO

00:59:30.133 --> 00:59:31.367
AFTER GRADUATING FROM BROWN,

00:59:31.367 --> 00:59:33.133
IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO ME
IN A MILLION YEARS

00:59:33.133 --> 00:59:35.501
TO GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL,
JUST OUT OF MY IMAGINATION.

00:59:35.501 --> 00:59:38.367
IT WASN'T THE KIND OF THING
PEOPLE FROM MY FAMILY DID.

00:59:38.367 --> 00:59:39.801
WE GOT, SAY,
WHAT DO YOU CALL THEM?

00:59:39.801 --> 00:59:42.000
JOBS.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.667
AND ANDY SAID,
"NO, DON'T GO DO THAT.

00:59:44.667 --> 00:59:46.601
GO GET A PhD.
BECOME A PROFESSOR."

00:59:46.601 --> 00:59:48.200
AND I SAID, "WHY?"

00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:52.300
AND HE SAID, "BECAUSE
YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD SALESMAN

00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:53.634
"THAT ANY COMPANY WHO GETS YOU

00:59:53.634 --> 00:59:55.667
"IS GOING TO USE YOU
AS A SALESMAN,

00:59:55.667 --> 00:59:58.200
"AND YOU MIGHT AS WELL
BE SELLING

00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:01.133
SOMETHING WORTHWHILE
LIKE EDUCATION."

01:00:06.067 --> 01:00:09.167
THANKS.

01:00:09.167 --> 01:00:12.367
ANDY WAS MY FIRST BOSS,
SO TO SPEAK.

01:00:12.367 --> 01:00:15.634
I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE
A LOT OF BOSSES.

01:00:15.634 --> 01:00:16.968
THAT RED CIRCLE IS WAY OFF.

01:00:16.968 --> 01:00:19.634
AL IS OVER HERE.

01:00:19.634 --> 01:00:22.167
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED THERE.

01:00:22.167 --> 01:00:24.133
HE'S PROBABLY WATCHING THIS
ON THE WEBCAST GOING,

01:00:24.133 --> 01:00:29.534
"MY GOD, HE'S TARGETING,
AND HE STILL CAN'T AIM!"

01:00:29.534 --> 01:00:31.667
I DON'T WANT TO SAY MUCH
ABOUT THE GREAT BOSSES I'VE HAD

01:00:31.667 --> 01:00:33.467
EXCEPT THAT THEY WERE GREAT,

01:00:33.467 --> 01:00:35.901
AND I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE IN
THE WORLD HAVE HAD BAD BOSSES,

01:00:35.901 --> 01:00:37.901
AND I HAVEN'T HAD TO ENDURE
THAT EXPERIENCE,

01:00:37.901 --> 01:00:39.634
AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL
TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE

01:00:39.634 --> 01:00:41.067
THAT I EVER HAD TO REPORT TO.

01:00:41.067 --> 01:00:42.701
THEY'VE JUST BEEN INCREDIBLE.

01:00:42.701 --> 01:00:44.634
BUT IT'S NOT
JUST OUR BOSSES.

01:00:44.634 --> 01:00:45.834
WE LEARN FROM OUR STUDENTS.

01:00:45.834 --> 01:00:47.734
I THINK THE BEST HEAD FAKE
OF ALL TIME

01:00:47.734 --> 01:00:49.267
COMES FROM CAITLIN KELLEHER--

01:00:49.267 --> 01:00:52.033
EXCUSE ME,
DR. CAITLIN KELLEHER--

01:00:52.033 --> 01:00:53.133
WHO JUST FINISHED UP HERE

01:00:53.133 --> 01:00:54.834
AND IS STARTING
AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,

01:00:54.834 --> 01:00:56.501
AND SHE LOOKED AT ALICE

01:00:56.501 --> 01:00:58.267
WHEN IT WAS AN EASIER WAY
TO LEARN TO PROGRAM,

01:00:58.267 --> 01:01:00.767
AND SHE SAID, "YEAH,
BUT WHY IS THAT FUN?"

01:01:00.767 --> 01:01:03.367
I WAS LIKE, "WELL,
'CAUSE I'M A COMPULSIVE MALE.

01:01:03.367 --> 01:01:05.367
"I LIKE TO MAKE THE LITTLE TOY
SOLDIERS MOVE AROUND

01:01:05.367 --> 01:01:08.501
BY MY COMMAND,
AND THAT'S FUN."

01:01:08.501 --> 01:01:10.501
SHE'S LIKE, "HMM."

01:01:10.501 --> 01:01:11.968
AND SHE WAS THE ONE WHO SAID,

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:14.868
"NO, WE'LL JUST APPROACH IT ALL
AS A STORYTELLING ACTIVITY."

01:01:14.868 --> 01:01:17.667
AND SHE'S DONE WONDERFUL WORK
SHOWING THAT,

01:01:17.667 --> 01:01:19.267
PARTICULARLY WITH
MIDDLE SCHOOL GIRLS,

01:01:19.267 --> 01:01:21.067
IF YOU PRESENT IT
AS A STORYTELLING ACTIVITY,

01:01:21.067 --> 01:01:22.501
THEY'RE PERFECTLY WILLING
TO LEARN

01:01:22.501 --> 01:01:24.033
HOW TO WRITE COMPUTER SOFTWARE.

01:01:24.033 --> 01:01:27.033
SO ALL-TIME BEST
HEAD FAKE AWARD

01:01:27.033 --> 01:01:31.067
GOES TO CAITLIN KELLEHER'S
DISSERTATION.

01:01:31.067 --> 01:01:32.734
PRESIDENT COHON,
WHEN I TOLD HIM

01:01:32.734 --> 01:01:33.934
I WAS GOING TO DO THIS TALK,

01:01:33.934 --> 01:01:37.167
HE SAID, "PLEASE TELL THEM
ABOUT HAVING FUN,

01:01:37.167 --> 01:01:41.133
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
I REMEMBER YOU FOR."

01:01:41.133 --> 01:01:43.167
AND I SAID, "I CAN DO THAT,
BUT IT'S KIND OF LIKE A FISH

01:01:43.167 --> 01:01:46.067
TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE
OF WATER."

01:01:46.067 --> 01:01:48.934
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO NOT HAVE FUN.

01:01:48.934 --> 01:01:52.200
ALL RIGHT, I'M DYING,
AND I'M HAVING FUN,

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:56.934
AND I'M GOING TO KEEP HAVING FUN
EVERY DAY I HAVE LEFT,

01:01:56.934 --> 01:01:59.467
BECAUSE THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
TO PLAY IT.

01:01:59.467 --> 01:02:00.734
ALL RIGHT?

01:02:00.734 --> 01:02:02.868
SO MY NEXT PIECE OF ADVICE IS,

01:02:02.868 --> 01:02:04.767
YOU JUST HAVE TO DECIDE
IF YOU'RE A TIGGER

01:02:04.767 --> 01:02:06.601
OR YOU'RE AN EEYORE.

01:02:06.601 --> 01:02:08.667
I THINK I'M CLEAR WHERE I STAND

01:02:08.667 --> 01:02:13.534
ON THE GREAT
TIGGER-EEYORE DEBATE.

01:02:13.534 --> 01:02:17.033
NEVER LOSE THE CHILDLIKE WONDER.

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:18.634
IT'S JUST TOO IMPORTANT.

01:02:18.634 --> 01:02:20.200
IT'S WHAT DRIVES US.

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.501
HELP OTHERS.

01:02:22.501 --> 01:02:25.601
DENNY PROFFITT KNOWS MORE ABOUT
HELPING OTHER PEOPLE.

01:02:25.601 --> 01:02:27.801
HE'S FORGOTTEN MORE
THAN I'LL EVER KNOW.

01:02:27.801 --> 01:02:29.934
HE'S TAUGHT ME BY EXAMPLE
HOW TO RUN A GROUP,

01:02:29.934 --> 01:02:31.767
HOW TO CARE ABOUT PEOPLE.

01:02:31.767 --> 01:02:32.901
M.K. HALEY--
I HAVE A THEORY

01:02:32.901 --> 01:02:34.534
THAT PEOPLE WHO COME
FROM LARGE FAMILIES

01:02:34.534 --> 01:02:35.834
ARE BETTER PEOPLE,

01:02:35.834 --> 01:02:37.834
BECAUSE THEY'VE JUST HAD
TO LEARN HOW TO GET ALONG.

01:02:37.834 --> 01:02:41.167
M.K. HALEY COMES FROM A FAMILY
WITH 20 KIDS.

01:02:41.167 --> 01:02:43.968
YEAH, UNBELIEVABLE.

01:02:43.968 --> 01:02:46.834
AND SHE ALWAYS SAYS, "IT'S KIND
OF FUN TO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE."

01:02:46.834 --> 01:02:48.234
WHEN I FIRST GOT
TO IMAGINEERING,

01:02:48.234 --> 01:02:50.100
SHE WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE
WHO DRESSED ME DOWN,

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:51.601
AND SHE SAID, "I UNDERSTAND

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.100
"YOU'VE JOINED
THE ALADDIN PROJECT.

01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:54.734
WHAT CAN YOU DO?"

01:02:54.734 --> 01:02:57.567
AND I SAID, "WELL, I'M A TENURED
PROFESSOR OF COMPUTER SCIENCE."

01:02:57.567 --> 01:02:59.801
AND SHE SAID, "WELL,
THAT'S VERY NICE PROFESSOR BOY,

01:02:59.801 --> 01:03:01.300
"BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I ASKED.

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:02.868
I SAID, 'WHAT CAN YOU DO?'"

01:03:02.868 --> 01:03:05.801
[laughter]

01:03:09.901 --> 01:03:15.400
AND, YOU KNOW, I MENTIONED
SORT OF MY WORKING-CLASS ROOTS.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:17.567
WE KEEP WHAT IS VALUABLE TO US,
WHAT WE CHERISH,

01:03:17.567 --> 01:03:19.767
AND I'VE KEPT MY LETTERMAN'S
JACKET ALL THESE YEARS.

01:03:19.767 --> 01:03:22.033
I USED TO LIKE WEARING IT
IN GRAD SCHOOL,

01:03:22.033 --> 01:03:25.934
AND ONE OF MY FRIENDS,
JESSICA HODGINS WOULD SAY,

01:03:25.934 --> 01:03:28.067
"WHY DO YOU WEAR
THIS LETTERMAN'S JACKET?"

01:03:28.067 --> 01:03:30.567
AND I LOOKED AROUND AT ALL
THE NON-ATHLETIC GUYS AROUND ME

01:03:30.567 --> 01:03:35.234
WHO WERE MUCH SMARTER THAN ME,
AND I SAID, "BECAUSE I CAN."

01:03:35.234 --> 01:03:38.133
AND SO SHE THOUGHT
THAT WAS A REAL HOOT,

01:03:38.133 --> 01:03:42.167
SO ONE YEAR SHE MADE FOR ME
THIS LITTLE RAGGEDY RANDY DOLL.

01:03:42.167 --> 01:03:44.567
HE'S GOT A LITTLE
LETTERMAN'S JACKET TOO.

01:03:44.567 --> 01:03:46.300
THAT'S MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE.

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:50.100
IT'S THE PERFECT GIFT FOR
THE EGOMANIAC IN YOUR LIFE.

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:55.334
SO I'VE MET SO MANY
WONDERFUL PEOPLE ALONG THE WAY.

01:03:55.334 --> 01:03:57.200
LOYALTY IS A TWO-WAY STREET.

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.167
THERE WAS A YOUNG MAN
NAMED DENNIS COSGROVE

01:03:59.167 --> 01:04:05.133
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,
AND WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG MAN,

01:04:05.133 --> 01:04:09.000
LET'S JUST SAY THINGS HAPPENED,

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.901
AND I FOUND MYSELF TALKING
TO A DEAN, AND THE DEAN--

01:04:13.901 --> 01:04:17.234
NO, NOT THAT DEAN.

01:04:17.234 --> 01:04:19.167
AND ANYWAY, THIS DEAN
REALLY HAD IT IN FOR DENNIS,

01:04:19.167 --> 01:04:20.167
AND I COULD NEVER
FIGURE OUT WHY,

01:04:20.167 --> 01:04:21.200
BECAUSE DENNIS
WAS A FINE FELLOW,

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.200
BUT FOR SOME REASON,

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:23.567
THIS DEAN REALLY HAD IT
IN FOR HIM.

01:04:23.567 --> 01:04:25.767
AND I ENDED UP BASICALLY SAYING,
"NO, I VOUCH FOR DENNIS."

01:04:25.767 --> 01:04:27.868
AND THE GUY SAYS, "YOU'RE NOT
EVEN TENURED YET,

01:04:27.868 --> 01:04:30.267
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU'RE GOING TO VOUCH

01:04:30.267 --> 01:04:32.067
FOR THIS SOPHOMORE OR JUNIOR
OR WHATEVER?"

01:04:32.067 --> 01:04:33.400
I THINK HE WAS A JUNIOR
AT THE TIME.

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.000
I SAID, "YEAH, I'M GOING
TO VOUCH FOR HIM,

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.300
BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN HIM."

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:38.234
AND THE DEAN SAID,
"AND I'M GOING TO REMEMBER THIS

01:04:38.234 --> 01:04:40.133
WHEN YOUR TENURE CASE
COMES UP."

01:04:40.133 --> 01:04:41.534
AND I SAID, "DEAL."

01:04:41.534 --> 01:04:43.601
I WENT BACK TO TALK TO DENNIS,
AND I SAID,

01:04:43.601 --> 01:04:48.934
"I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE YOU--
THAT WOULD BE GOOD."

01:04:48.934 --> 01:04:50.400
BUT LOYALTY IS A TWO-WAY STREET.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.534
I MEAN, THAT WAS GOD KNOWS
HOW MANY YEARS AGO,

01:04:52.534 --> 01:04:55.033
BUT THAT'S THE SAME
DENNIS COSGROVE

01:04:55.033 --> 01:04:57.033
WHO'S CARRYING ALICE FORWARD.

01:04:57.033 --> 01:04:59.267
HE'S BEEN WITH ME
ALL THESE YEARS, ALL RIGHT.

01:04:59.267 --> 01:05:01.634
AND, YOU KNOW,
IF WE ONLY HAD ONE PERSON

01:05:01.634 --> 01:05:02.968
TO SEND IN
A SPACE PROBE

01:05:02.968 --> 01:05:08.701
TO MEET AN ALIEN SPECIES,
I'M PICKING DENNIS.

01:05:08.701 --> 01:05:10.267
YOU CAN'T GIVE A TALK
AT CARNEGIE MELLON

01:05:10.267 --> 01:05:13.534
WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING
ONE VERY SPECIAL PERSON,

01:05:13.534 --> 01:05:16.067
AND THAT WOULD BE SHARON BURKS.

01:05:16.067 --> 01:05:17.300
I JOKED WITH HER.

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:18.901
I SAID, "WELL, LOOK,
IF YOU'RE RETIRING,

01:05:18.901 --> 01:05:20.701
IT'S JUST NOT WORTH
LIVING ANYMORE."

01:05:20.701 --> 01:05:24.234
[laughter]

01:05:24.234 --> 01:05:26.868
SHARON IS SO WONDERFUL,
IT'S BEYOND DESCRIPTION,

01:05:26.868 --> 01:05:28.901
AND FOR ALL OF US WHO
HAVE BEEN HELPED BY HER,

01:05:28.901 --> 01:05:30.534
IT'S JUST INDESCRIBABLE.

01:05:30.534 --> 01:05:31.567
I LOVE THIS PICTURE,

01:05:31.567 --> 01:05:33.100
BECAUSE IT PUTS
HER TOGETHER WITH SYL,

01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:34.467
AND SYL IS GREAT,

01:05:34.467 --> 01:05:38.300
BECAUSE SYL GAVE THE BEST PIECE
OF ADVICE POUND FOR POUND

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:39.701
THAT I HAVE EVER HEARD,

01:05:39.701 --> 01:05:42.601
AND I THINK ALL YOUNG LADIES
SHOULD HEAR THIS.

01:05:42.601 --> 01:05:44.200
SYL SAID, "IT TOOK ME
A LONG TIME,

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.200
"BUT I'VE
FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT.

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:49.968
"WHEN IT COMES TO MEN THAT ARE
ROMANTICALLY INTERESTED IN YOU,

01:05:49.968 --> 01:05:51.767
"IT'S REALLY SIMPLE.

01:05:51.767 --> 01:05:54.634
"JUST IGNORE EVERYTHING THEY SAY

01:05:54.634 --> 01:05:58.200
"AND ONLY PAY ATTENTION
TO WHAT THEY DO.

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:01.200
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.
IT'S THAT EASY."

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:03.400
AND I THOUGHT BACK
TO MY BACHELOR DAYS,

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:06.000
AND I SAID, "DAMN."

01:06:09.567 --> 01:06:11.200
NEVER GIVE UP.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.934
I DIDN'T GET
INTO BROWN UNIVERSITY.

01:06:12.934 --> 01:06:14.667
I WAS ON THE WAIT LIST.

01:06:14.667 --> 01:06:17.968
I CALLED THEM UP,
AND THEY EVENTUALLY DECIDED

01:06:17.968 --> 01:06:20.234
THAT IT WAS GETTING
REALLY ANNOYING

01:06:20.234 --> 01:06:23.100
TO HAVE ME CALL EVERY DAY,
SO THEY LET ME IN.

01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:25.267
AT CARNEGIE MELLON, I DIDN'T
GET INTO GRADUATE SCHOOL.

01:06:25.267 --> 01:06:26.267
ANDY HAD MENTORED ME.

01:06:26.267 --> 01:06:27.501
HE SAID, "GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL.

01:06:27.501 --> 01:06:28.968
"YOU'RE GOING
TO CARNEGIE MELLON.

01:06:28.968 --> 01:06:31.734
ALL MY GOOD STUDENTS
GO TO CARNEGIE MELLON."

01:06:31.734 --> 01:06:33.601
AND, YEAH,
YOU KNOW WHAT'S COMING.

01:06:33.601 --> 01:06:35.734
AND SO HE SAID, "YOU'RE GOING
TO GO TO CARNEGIE MELLON,

01:06:35.734 --> 01:06:37.067
NO PROBLEM."

01:06:37.067 --> 01:06:39.200
WHAT HE HAD KIND OF FORGOTTEN
WAS THAT THE DIFFICULTY

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:41.601
OF GETTING INTO THE TOP
PhD PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY

01:06:41.601 --> 01:06:43.200
HAD REALLY GONE UP,

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:46.567
AND HE ALSO DIDN'T KNOW
I WAS GOING TO TANK MY GREs,

01:06:46.567 --> 01:06:48.033
BECAUSE HE BELIEVED IN ME,

01:06:48.033 --> 01:06:49.534
WHICH,
BASED ON MY BOARD SCORES,

01:06:49.534 --> 01:06:51.534
WAS A REALLY STUPID IDEA,

01:06:51.534 --> 01:06:53.300
AND SO I DIDN'T
GET INTO CARNEGIE MELLON.

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:54.400
NO ONE KNOWS THIS TILL TODAY.

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.567
I'M TELLING THE STORY.

01:06:55.567 --> 01:06:57.667
I WAS DECLINED ADMISSION
TO CARNEGIE MELLON,

01:06:57.667 --> 01:07:02.767
AND I WAS A BIT
OF AN OBNOXIOUS LITTLE KID.

01:07:02.767 --> 01:07:04.133
I WENT INTO ANDY'S OFFICE,

01:07:04.133 --> 01:07:06.300
AND I DROPPED THE REJECTION
LETTER ON HIS DESK.

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:07.801
AND I SAID, "I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW

01:07:07.801 --> 01:07:09.667
"WHAT YOUR LETTER
OF RECOMMENDATION GOES FOR

01:07:09.667 --> 01:07:10.934
AT CARNEGIE MELLON."

01:07:10.934 --> 01:07:13.868
[laughter]

01:07:18.634 --> 01:07:22.000
AND BEFORE THE LETTER
HAD HIT HIS DESK,

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.234
HIS HAND WAS ON THE PHONE,
AND HE SAID,

01:07:24.234 --> 01:07:26.501
"I WILL FIX THIS."

01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:30.167
[laughter]

01:07:30.167 --> 01:07:31.234
AND I SAID, "NO, NO, NO,

01:07:31.234 --> 01:07:32.501
"I DON'T WANT TO DO IT THAT WAY.

01:07:32.501 --> 01:07:33.801
"THAT'S NOT THE WAY
I WAS RAISED.

01:07:33.801 --> 01:07:35.634
"YOU KNOW, MAYBE SOME OTHER
GRADUATE SCHOOLS

01:07:35.634 --> 01:07:37.968
WILL SEE FIT TO ADMIT ME."
AND HE SAID, "LOOK.

01:07:37.968 --> 01:07:39.868
CARNEGIE MELLON'S
WHERE YOU'RE GONNA BE."

01:07:39.868 --> 01:07:41.767
HE SAID, "I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL.

01:07:41.767 --> 01:07:42.968
GO VISIT THE OTHER SCHOOLS."

01:07:42.968 --> 01:07:44.734
BECAUSE I DID GET INTO
ALL THE OTHER SCHOOLS.

01:07:44.734 --> 01:07:46.200
HE SAID, "GO VISIT
THE OTHER SCHOOLS,

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:48.400
"AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T
FEEL COMFORTABLE AT ANY OF THEM,

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.000
THEN WILL YOU LET ME CALL NICO?"
NICO BEING NICO HABERMANN.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.501
AND I SAID, "OKAY, DEAL."
I WENT TO THE OTHER SCHOOLS.

01:07:53.501 --> 01:07:58.133
WITHOUT NAMING THEM BY NAME--
BERKELEY, CORNELL--

01:07:58.133 --> 01:08:00.300
THEY MANAGED TO BE
SO UNWELCOMING

01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:01.801
THAT I FOUND MYSELF
SAYING TO ANDY,

01:08:01.801 --> 01:08:03.534
"YOU KNOW,
I'M GOING TO GET A JOB."

01:08:03.534 --> 01:08:05.267
AND HE SAID, "NO, YOU'RE NOT,"

01:08:05.267 --> 01:08:08.200
AND HE PICKED UP THE PHONE,
AND HE TALKED IN DUTCH.

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:11.000
[laughter]

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.200
AND HE HUNG UP THE PHONE,
AND HE SAID,

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.934
"NICO SAYS IF YOU'RE SERIOUS,

01:08:14.934 --> 01:08:19.901
BE IN HIS OFFICE
TOMORROW MORNING AT 8:00 A.M."

01:08:19.901 --> 01:08:22.434
AND FOR THOSE OF YOU
WHO KNOW NICO,

01:08:22.434 --> 01:08:24.400
THIS IS REALLY SCARY.

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:25.734
SO I'M IN
NICO HABERMANN'S OFFICE

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:26.968
THE NEXT MORNING
AT 8:00 A.M.,

01:08:26.968 --> 01:08:29.167
AND HE'S TALKING WITH ME,
AND FRANKLY,

01:08:29.167 --> 01:08:31.734
I DON'T THINK HE'S THAT KEEN
ON THIS MEETING.

01:08:31.734 --> 01:08:33.167
I DON'T THINK HE'S
THAT KEEN AT ALL.

01:08:33.167 --> 01:08:39.234
AND HE SAYS, "RANDY,
WHY ARE WE HERE?"

01:08:39.234 --> 01:08:43.734
AND I SAID,
"BECAUSE ANDY PHONED YOU?"

01:08:43.734 --> 01:08:48.167
AND I SAID, "WELL,
SINCE YOU ADMITTED ME,

01:08:48.167 --> 01:08:50.033
"I HAVE WON A FELLOWSHIP.

01:08:50.033 --> 01:08:51.767
"THE OFFICE OF NAVAL RESEARCH,

01:08:51.767 --> 01:08:53.300
"IT'S A VERY PRESTIGIOUS
FELLOWSHIP.

01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:54.501
"I'VE WON THIS FELLOWSHIP,

01:08:54.501 --> 01:08:56.601
AND THAT WASN'T IN MY FILE
WHEN I APPLIED."

01:08:56.601 --> 01:09:00.968
AND NICO SAID, "A FELLOWSHIP,
MONEY, WE HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY."

01:09:00.968 --> 01:09:04.634
THAT WAS BACK THEN.

01:09:04.634 --> 01:09:06.033
HE SAID, "WE HAVE PLENTY
OF MONEY.

01:09:06.033 --> 01:09:07.868
"WHY DO YOU THINK
HAVING A FELLOWSHIP

01:09:07.868 --> 01:09:09.734
MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE TO US?"

01:09:09.734 --> 01:09:10.934
AND HE LOOKED AT ME.

01:09:10.934 --> 01:09:13.367
THERE ARE MOMENTS
THAT CHANGE YOUR LIFE,

01:09:13.367 --> 01:09:14.734
AND TEN YEARS LATER,

01:09:14.734 --> 01:09:17.267
IF YOU KNOW IN RETROSPECT
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS,

01:09:17.267 --> 01:09:18.667
YOU'RE BLESSED,

01:09:18.667 --> 01:09:22.701
BUT TO KNOW IT AT THE MOMENT

01:09:22.701 --> 01:09:27.367
WITH NICO
STARING THROUGH YOUR SOUL...

01:09:27.367 --> 01:09:28.767
AND I SAID, "I DIDN'T MEAN
TO IMPLY

01:09:28.767 --> 01:09:30.133
"ANYTHING ABOUT THE MONEY.

01:09:30.133 --> 01:09:31.367
"IT'S JUST THAT
IT WAS AN HONOR.

01:09:31.367 --> 01:09:32.901
"THERE WERE ONLY
15 GIVEN NATIONWIDE,

01:09:32.901 --> 01:09:34.133
"AND I DID THINK
IT WAS AN HONOR

01:09:34.133 --> 01:09:36.834
"THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING
THAT WOULD BE MERITORIOUS,

01:09:36.834 --> 01:09:41.133
AND I APOLOGIZE
IF THAT WAS PRESUMPTUOUS."

01:09:41.133 --> 01:09:44.834
AND HE SMILED,
AND THAT WAS GOOD.

01:09:44.834 --> 01:09:47.133
SO HOW DO YOU GET PEOPLE
TO HELP YOU?

01:09:47.133 --> 01:09:48.400
YOU CAN'T GET THERE ALONE.

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:51.667
PEOPLE HAVE TO HELP YOU,
AND I DO BELIEVE IN KARMA.

01:09:51.667 --> 01:09:52.667
I BELIEVE IN PAYBACKS.

01:09:52.667 --> 01:09:53.767
YOU GET PEOPLE TO HELP YOU

01:09:53.767 --> 01:09:55.734
BY TELLING THE TRUTH,
BEING EARNEST.

01:09:55.734 --> 01:09:59.133
I'LL TAKE AN EARNEST PERSON
OVER A HIP PERSON EVERY DAY,

01:09:59.133 --> 01:10:00.300
BECAUSE HIP IS SHORT-TERM.

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:02.801
EARNEST IS LONG-TERM.

01:10:02.801 --> 01:10:07.067
APOLOGIZE WHEN YOU SCREW UP
AND FOCUS ON OTHER PEOPLE,

01:10:07.067 --> 01:10:08.167
NOT ON YOURSELF.

01:10:08.167 --> 01:10:10.734
AND I THOUGHT,
HOW DO I POSSIBLY

01:10:10.734 --> 01:10:13.100
MAKE A CONCRETE EXAMPLE
OF THAT?

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:14.634
DO WE HAVE A CONCRETE EXAMPLE

01:10:14.634 --> 01:10:16.734
OF FOCUSING ON SOMEBODY ELSE
OVER THERE?

01:10:16.734 --> 01:10:18.400
COULD WE BRING IT OUT?

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.901
SEE, YESTERDAY
WAS MY WIFE'S BIRTHDAY.

01:10:20.901 --> 01:10:23.601
IF THERE WAS EVER A TIME
I MIGHT BE ENTITLED

01:10:23.601 --> 01:10:24.734
TO HAVE THE FOCUS ON ME,

01:10:24.734 --> 01:10:27.367
IT MIGHT BE
THE LAST LECTURE.

01:10:27.367 --> 01:10:29.100
BUT NO, I FEEL VERY BADLY

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:31.167
THAT MY WIFE DIDN'T REALLY GET
A PROPER BIRTHDAY,

01:10:31.167 --> 01:10:33.934
AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
VERY NICE IF 500 PEOPLE--

01:10:33.934 --> 01:10:36.868
[applause]

01:10:53.434 --> 01:10:56.534
all singing:
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU.

01:10:56.534 --> 01:10:57.601
Pausch: HER NAME IS JAI.

01:10:57.601 --> 01:11:00.968
all singing:
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU.

01:11:00.968 --> 01:11:05.567
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DEAR JAI.

01:11:05.567 --> 01:11:09.734
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU.

01:11:09.734 --> 01:11:12.667
[cheers and applause]

01:11:18.667 --> 01:11:20.601
Pausch: YOU GOT
TO BLOW IT OUT.

01:11:27.367 --> 01:11:28.567
ALL RIGHT.

01:11:28.567 --> 01:11:31.501
[applause]

01:11:37.834 --> 01:11:39.601
AND NOW YOU ALL HAVE
AN EXTRA REASON

01:11:39.601 --> 01:11:43.601
TO COME TO THE RECEPTION.

01:11:43.601 --> 01:11:46.567
REMEMBER, BRICK WALLS LET US
SHOW OUR DEDICATION.

01:11:46.567 --> 01:11:48.300
THEY ARE THERE TO SEPARATE US

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:50.100
FROM THE PEOPLE
WHO DON'T REALLY WANT

01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:51.734
TO ACHIEVE
THEIR CHILDHOOD DREAMS.

01:11:51.734 --> 01:11:53.467
DON'T BAIL.

01:11:53.467 --> 01:11:56.100
THE BEST OF THE GOLD IS AT
THE BOTTOM OF BARRELS OF CRAP.

01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:59.033
[laughter]

01:12:01.234 --> 01:12:07.834
WHAT STEVE DIDN'T TELL YOU
WAS THE BIG SABBATICAL AT EA.

01:12:07.834 --> 01:12:11.200
I HAD BEEN THERE FOR 48 HOURS,
AND THEY LOVED THE ETC.

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:12.334
WE WERE THE BEST.

01:12:12.334 --> 01:12:13.601
WE WERE THE FAVORITES,

01:12:13.601 --> 01:12:15.701
AND THEN SOMEBODY ELSE
PULLED ME ASIDE AND SAID,

01:12:15.701 --> 01:12:16.968
"OH, BY THE WAY,

01:12:16.968 --> 01:12:18.734
"WE'RE ABOUT TO GIVE $8 MILLION
TO USC

01:12:18.734 --> 01:12:20.200
"TO BUILD A PROGRAM
JUST LIKE YOURS.

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:22.234
WE'RE HOPING YOU CAN HELP THEM
GET IT OFF THE GROUND."

01:12:22.234 --> 01:12:25.167
[laughter]

01:12:27.467 --> 01:12:28.868
AND THEN STEVE CAME ALONG
AND SAID,

01:12:28.868 --> 01:12:31.567
"THEY SAID WHAT?
OH, GOD."

01:12:31.567 --> 01:12:35.934
AND TO QUOTE A FAMOUS MAN,
"I WILL FIX THIS."

01:12:35.934 --> 01:12:37.200
AND HE DID.

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:39.133
STEVE HAS BEEN
AN INCREDIBLE PARTNER,

01:12:39.133 --> 01:12:40.567
AND WE HAVE
A GREAT RELATIONSHIP,

01:12:40.567 --> 01:12:42.701
PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL,

01:12:42.701 --> 01:12:44.267
AND HE HAS CERTAINLY
BEEN POINT MAN

01:12:44.267 --> 01:12:48.601
ON GETTING A GAMING ASSET
TO HELP TEACH MILLIONS OF KIDS,

01:12:48.601 --> 01:12:51.067
AND, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S JUST INCREDIBLE.

01:12:51.067 --> 01:12:53.934
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT CERTAINLY
WOULD HAVE BEEN REASONABLE

01:12:53.934 --> 01:12:57.300
FOR ME TO LEAVE 48 HOURS
INTO THAT SABBATICAL,

01:12:57.300 --> 01:13:00.000
BUT IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
THE RIGHT THING TO DO,

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.734
AND WHEN YOU DO
THE RIGHT THING,

01:13:01.734 --> 01:13:05.767
GOOD STUFF HAS A WAY
OF HAPPENING.

01:13:05.767 --> 01:13:07.968
GET A FEEDBACK LOOP
AND LISTEN TO IT.

01:13:07.968 --> 01:13:10.501
YOUR FEEDBACK LOOP CAN BE THIS
DORKY SPREADSHEET THING I DID,

01:13:10.501 --> 01:13:12.033
OR IT CAN JUST BE ONE GREAT MAN

01:13:12.033 --> 01:13:14.000
WHO TELLS YOU
WHAT YOU NEED TO HEAR.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.267
THE HARD PART
IS THE LISTENING TO IT.

01:13:16.267 --> 01:13:18.534
ANYBODY CAN GET CHEWED OUT.

01:13:18.534 --> 01:13:21.334
IT'S THE RARE PERSON WHO SAYS,
"OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE RIGHT,"

01:13:21.334 --> 01:13:23.801
AS OPPOSED TO, "NO WAIT,
THE REAL REASON IS"--

01:13:23.801 --> 01:13:25.267
WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT.

01:13:25.267 --> 01:13:28.801
WHEN PEOPLE GIVE YOU FEEDBACK,
CHERISH IT AND USE IT.

01:13:28.801 --> 01:13:30.667
SHOW GRATITUDE.

01:13:30.667 --> 01:13:33.100
WHEN I GOT TENURE,
I TOOK ALL OF MY RESEARCH TEAM

01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:34.968
DOWN TO DISNEYWORLD FOR A WEEK,

01:13:34.968 --> 01:13:37.000
AND ONE OF THE OTHER PROFESSORS
AT VIRGINIA SAID,

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.067
"HOW CAN YOU DO THAT?"

01:13:39.067 --> 01:13:40.868
I SAID, "THESE PEOPLE
JUST BUSTED THEIR ASS

01:13:40.868 --> 01:13:42.667
"AND GOT ME THE BEST JOB
IN THE WORLD FOR LIFE.

01:13:42.667 --> 01:13:46.033
HOW COULD I NOT DO THAT?"
RIGHT?

01:13:46.033 --> 01:13:49.534
DON'T COMPLAIN;
JUST WORK HARDER.

01:13:49.534 --> 01:13:51.067
THAT'S A PICTURE
OF JACKIE ROBINSON.

01:13:51.067 --> 01:13:52.601
IT WAS IN HIS CONTRACT
NOT TO COMPLAIN,

01:13:52.601 --> 01:13:56.601
EVEN WHEN THE FANS
SPIT ON HIM.

01:13:56.601 --> 01:14:00.267
BE GOOD AT SOMETHING;
IT MAKES YOU VALUABLE.

01:14:00.267 --> 01:14:02.367
WORK HARD.

01:14:02.367 --> 01:14:04.200
I GOT TENURE A YEAR EARLY
AS STEVE MENTIONED.

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:05.801
JUNIOR FACULTY MEMBERS
USED TO SAY TO ME,

01:14:05.801 --> 01:14:07.100
"WOW, YOU GOT TENURE EARLY.

01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:09.267
WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?"

01:14:09.267 --> 01:14:10.567
I SAID, "IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.

01:14:10.567 --> 01:14:12.467
"CALL ME ANY FRIDAY NIGHT
IN MY OFFICE AT 10:00,

01:14:12.467 --> 01:14:15.200
AND I'LL TELL YOU."

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:16.300
FIND THE BEST IN EVERYBODY.

01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:17.634
ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT JON SNODDY,

01:14:17.634 --> 01:14:19.133
AS I SAID, TOLD ME

01:14:19.133 --> 01:14:22.801
IS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT
A LONG TIME, SOMETIMES YEARS,

01:14:22.801 --> 01:14:25.501
BUT PEOPLE WILL SHOW YOU
THEIR GOOD SIDE.

01:14:25.501 --> 01:14:29.934
JUST KEEP WAITING, NO MATTER
HOW LONG IT TAKES.

01:14:29.934 --> 01:14:31.901
NO ONE IS ALL EVIL.

01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:32.901
EVERYBODY HAS A GOOD SIDE.

01:14:32.901 --> 01:14:33.901
JUST KEEP WAITING.

01:14:33.901 --> 01:14:34.934
IT WILL COME OUT.

01:14:34.934 --> 01:14:36.200
AND BE PREPARED.

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:39.868
LUCK IS TRULY WHERE PREPARATION
MEETS OPPORTUNITY.

01:14:39.868 --> 01:14:43.133
SO TODAY'S TALK
WAS ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD DREAMS,

01:14:43.133 --> 01:14:49.167
ENABLING THE DREAMS OF OTHERS,
AND SOME LESSONS LEARNED.

01:14:49.167 --> 01:14:54.033
BUT DID YOU FIGURE OUT
THE HEAD FAKE?

01:14:54.033 --> 01:14:56.501
IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW
TO ACHIEVE YOUR DREAMS.

01:14:56.501 --> 01:14:59.234
IT'S ABOUT HOW
TO LEAD YOUR LIFE.

01:14:59.234 --> 01:15:00.968
IF YOU LEAD YOUR LIFE
THE RIGHT WAY,

01:15:00.968 --> 01:15:02.767
THE KARMA WILL TAKE CARE
OF ITSELF.

01:15:02.767 --> 01:15:05.534
THE DREAMS WILL COME TO YOU.

01:15:05.534 --> 01:15:10.767
HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT
THE SECOND HEAD FAKE?

01:15:10.767 --> 01:15:11.934
THE TALK'S NOT FOR YOU.

01:15:11.934 --> 01:15:13.033
IT'S FOR MY KIDS.

01:15:13.033 --> 01:15:15.601
THANK YOU ALL.
GOOD NIGHT.

01:15:15.601 --> 01:15:18.534
[applause]
