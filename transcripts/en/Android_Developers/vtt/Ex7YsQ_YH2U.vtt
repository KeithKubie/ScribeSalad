&gt;&gt; MIKE: Hi. My name is Mike and I'm an engineer
on the Android team. I'm going to show you

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.299
how you can easily embed web content into
your application. This includes HTML, CSS,

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.510
and JavaScript. In addition to displaying
this content, you can also control it from

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.769
your application. This is done with an embedded
WebView. Now, the Gmail application that's

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.579
included with Android actually uses an embedded
WebView in order to display the contents of

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.660
a conversation. We have all the HTML fragments
for each message in the conversation stored

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.360
in a database and then we put those together
and display them in a WebView. The WebView

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.380
actually looks like it's part of the Gmail
application because it is part of the Gmail

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.330
application. For example, if I bring up the
menu, the menu contains all the menu items

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.050
you'd expect to see in Gmail and not the kind
of menu items you expect to see in the browser.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.440
There's also two-way communication between
the content that's displayed in the WebView

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.900
and the Java application, that's the Gmail
application itself. So, for example, if I

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.799
touch on the first item in the list, you can
see that it expands, and the content for that

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:11.929
comes from the JavaScript that's running inside
the WebView, calling out into my Java code

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:17.640
to get the next fragment for HTML and putting
it back into the DOM. You can also have communication

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.109
going the other way. So if I star a message,
then my Java code is going to push a change

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:29.329
into the DOM by executing some JavaScript.
And you can see that here. Now, if you want

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.909
to use these techniques yourself, we have
some sample code available on the Apps for

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.299
Android site that shows how to embed a WebView
and how to have communication in and out of

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.469
that WebView from your activity. Using a WebView
is a really good option if you all ready have

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.840
a lot of content in HTML and JavaScript, and
it provides a really nice seamless experience

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.310
for the user.
