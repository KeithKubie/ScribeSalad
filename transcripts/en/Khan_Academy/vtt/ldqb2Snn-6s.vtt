00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.240
- [Instructor] If you want
to follow the footsteps

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.570
of Taylor Swift,

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.980
you would need to have
written your first novel

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.870
by age 11, have signed an
artist development deal

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.420
with a record company by age 14

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.840
and be releasing your
first album by age 16.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.330
So, this clause, even
before we think about

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.260
or the sentence even before
we think about the grammar,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.120
it puts a little bit of
undue pressure on you

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.280
if you wanted to be like Taylor Swift.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.410
She's a little bit of a overachiever,

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.510
but anyway, let's focus
on the grammar here.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.830
So, if you wanted to follow
the footsteps of Taylor Swift,

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.190
you would need to

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.710
and then they list three things

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.070
that you would need to do.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.800
You would need to have written

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.600
your first novel by age 11,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.130
have signed an artist development
deal with a record company

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.130
by age 14 and be releasing
your first album by age 16.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.380
So, when you read that,

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.160
have you noticed anything?

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.270
Each of these clauses,

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.420
have written starts with
a certain form of verb,

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.270
have written, in other words,
you could say a verb clause,

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.010
for have written, then you have signed

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.250
which feels parallel to have written,

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.030
it feels like the same form

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.040
but then you say and be releasing.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.500
Be releasing is a different
form than have written

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.700
or have signed, so this
last clause is breaking

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.920
the parallel structure here,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.780
so I definitely don't want no change.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.030
If I wanted it to be parallel,

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.050
I would say and have released,

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.460
and, let me write that down

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.480
before I even look at the choices.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.750
Have, let me write it over here,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.530
and have released

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.610
because it was and have released
your first album by age 16,

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.130
you have have written, have
signed and have released,

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.500
that would be parallel,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.130
so I would knock those out,

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.152
so let's see if any any of
these choices have that.

00:01:52.152 --> 00:01:53.830
Be signing,

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.810
no I don't wanna all of a
sudden make this parallel

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.530
to this and then it breaks
it with have written,

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.020
so I wanna rule that out.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.930
Have signed an artist development deal

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.110
with a record company by age 14

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.020
and have released your
first album by age 16.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.410
Yeah, this is, now it's all,

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.290
we have nice parallel structure.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.320
The same, we have have released,

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.060
we have have signed and have written.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.970
Be signing an artist development deal.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.370
Be signing once again,

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.020
this would break the parallel structure

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.870
with have written, so we wanna
rule that one out as well.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.253
So, feeling really good about this choice.
