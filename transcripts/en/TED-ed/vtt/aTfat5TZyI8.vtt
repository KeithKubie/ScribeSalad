00:00:14.626 --> 00:00:18.137
You believe that the Sun is much larger than the Earth,

00:00:18.137 --> 00:00:20.723
that the Earth is a roughly spherical planet

00:00:20.723 --> 00:00:23.718
that rotates on its axis every 24 hours

00:00:23.718 --> 00:00:28.966
and it revolves around the Sun once every 365 days.

00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:32.194
You believe that you were born on a particular date,

00:00:32.194 --> 00:00:34.779
that you were born to two human parents

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:36.614
and that each of your human parents

00:00:36.614 --> 00:00:38.939
was born on an earlier date.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:40.826
You believe that other human beings

00:00:40.826 --> 00:00:43.037
have thoughts and feelings like you do

00:00:43.037 --> 00:00:46.936
and that you are not surrounded by humanoid robots.

00:00:46.936 --> 00:00:49.667
You believe all of these things and many more,

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:52.606
not on the basis of direct observation,

00:00:52.606 --> 00:00:55.436
which can't, by itself, tell you very much

00:00:55.436 --> 00:00:57.135
about the relative size and motion

00:00:57.135 --> 00:00:58.393
of the Sun and the Earth,

00:00:58.393 --> 00:01:00.888
or about your own family history,

00:01:00.888 --> 00:01:04.269
or about what goes on in the minds of other humans.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.157
Instead, these beliefs are mostly based on

00:01:07.157 --> 00:01:09.147
what you've been told.

00:01:09.147 --> 00:01:11.184
Without spoken and written testimonies,

00:01:11.184 --> 00:01:13.703
human beings could not pass on knowledge

00:01:13.703 --> 00:01:15.240
from one person to another,

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.905
let alone from one generation to another.

00:01:17.905 --> 00:01:19.957
We would know much, much less

00:01:19.957 --> 00:01:22.073
about the world around us.

00:01:22.073 --> 00:01:23.786
So learning about a topic

00:01:23.786 --> 00:01:25.993
by asking an expert on that topic,

00:01:25.993 --> 00:01:28.206
or appealing to authority,

00:01:28.206 --> 00:01:30.413
helps us gain knowledge,

00:01:30.413 --> 00:01:32.784
but, it doesn't always.

00:01:32.784 --> 00:01:34.712
Even the most highly respected authorities

00:01:34.712 --> 00:01:36.629
can turn out to be wrong.

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:38.174
Occasionally this happens

00:01:38.174 --> 00:01:41.466
because a highly respected authority is dishonest

00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:42.940
and claims to know something

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.566
that she or he really doesn't know.

00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:50.304
Sometimes it happens just because they make a mistake.

00:01:50.304 --> 00:01:53.217
They think they know when they don't know.

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:56.970
For example, a number of respected economists

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.599
did not expect the financial collapse of 2008.

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.559
They turned out to be wrong.

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:03.310
Maybe they were wrong

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.276
because they were overlooking some important evidence.

00:02:06.276 --> 00:02:08.618
Maybe they were wrong because they were misinterpreting

00:02:08.618 --> 00:02:10.652
some of the evidence they had noticed.

00:02:10.652 --> 00:02:11.527
Or maybe they were wrong

00:02:11.527 --> 00:02:13.827
simply because they were reasoning carelessly

00:02:13.827 --> 00:02:15.789
from the total body of their evidence.

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:16.957
But whatever the reason,

00:02:16.957 --> 00:02:18.808
they turned out to be wrong

00:02:18.808 --> 00:02:20.787
and many people who trusted their authority

00:02:20.787 --> 00:02:22.944
ended up losing lots of money,

00:02:22.944 --> 00:02:25.268
losing lots of other people's money,

00:02:25.268 --> 00:02:27.926
on account of that misplaced trust.

00:02:27.926 --> 00:02:29.837
So while appealing to authority

00:02:29.837 --> 00:02:32.467
can sometimes provide us with valuable knowledge,

00:02:32.467 --> 00:02:34.432
it also can sometimes be the cause

00:02:34.432 --> 00:02:36.897
of monumental errors.

00:02:36.897 --> 00:02:39.698
It's important to all of us to be able to distinguish

00:02:39.698 --> 00:02:43.434
those occasions on which we can safely and reasonably trust authority

00:02:43.434 --> 00:02:46.499
from those occasions on which we can't.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.093
But how do we do that?

00:02:49.093 --> 00:02:50.458
In order to do that,

00:02:50.458 --> 00:02:52.143
nothing is more useful than

00:02:52.143 --> 00:02:55.827
an authority's track record on a particular topic.

00:02:55.827 --> 00:02:57.715
If someone turns out to perform well

00:02:57.715 --> 00:02:59.875
in a given situation much of the time,

00:02:59.875 --> 00:03:02.293
then it's likely that he or she will continue

00:03:02.293 --> 00:03:04.491
to perform well in that same situation,

00:03:04.491 --> 00:03:06.600
at least in the near term.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.928
And this generalization holds true

00:03:08.928 --> 00:03:12.495
of the testimony of authorities as much as of anything else.

00:03:12.495 --> 00:03:14.852
If someone can consistently pick winners

00:03:14.852 --> 00:03:16.936
in both politics and baseball,

00:03:16.936 --> 00:03:18.997
then we should probably trust him or her

00:03:18.997 --> 00:03:22.491
to keep on picking winners in both politics or baseball,

00:03:22.491 --> 00:03:23.860
though maybe not in other things

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.868
where his or her track record may be less stellar.

00:03:26.868 --> 00:03:29.493
If other forecasters have a poorer track record

00:03:29.493 --> 00:03:31.365
on those same two topics,

00:03:31.365 --> 00:03:33.794
then we shouldn't trust them as much.

00:03:34.978 --> 00:03:36.717
So whenever you're considering whether

00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:39.277
to trust the testimony of some authority,

00:03:39.277 --> 00:03:42.049
the first question to ask yourself is,

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.122
"What's their track record on this topic?"

00:03:45.122 --> 00:03:47.889
And notice that you can apply

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.870
the very same lesson to yourself.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.336
Your instincts tell you that you've just met Mr. Right,

00:03:54.336 --> 00:03:57.265
but what sort of track record do your instincts have

00:03:57.265 --> 00:03:59.363
on topics like this one?

00:03:59.363 --> 00:04:01.486
Have your instincts proven themselves

00:04:01.486 --> 00:04:03.537
to be worthy of your trust?

00:04:03.537 --> 00:04:06.404
Just as we judge other people's testimony

00:04:06.404 --> 00:04:07.991
by their track record,

00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:10.325
so, too, we can judge our own instincts

00:04:10.325 --> 00:04:12.019
by their track record.

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.332
And this brings us one step closer

00:04:14.332 --> 00:04:16.534
to an objective view of ourselves

00:04:16.534 --> 00:04:19.604
and our relation to the world around us.
