00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So the answer is to increase the amount of work required.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Normally, we want to use computation to reduce work,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but here the goal is to make this amount of work to find a bitcoin

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to be stable, to be fairly predictable, and to be about 10 minutes long.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And so, we could do that with just one hash function

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
by reducing the value of the target.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
That would require changing the target more frequently

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and using more zero bits in the target.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The alternative is to make it harder to compute each value of x,

00:00:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and that's what the two hash functions do.
