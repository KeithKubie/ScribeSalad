00:00:00.831 --> 00:00:02.932
- [Instructor] We're told
to complete the ratio table

00:00:02.932 --> 00:00:06.094
to convert the units of
measure from hours to weeks,

00:00:06.094 --> 00:00:08.180
or weeks to hours.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.916
So we see here, they've told us already

00:00:10.916 --> 00:00:14.525
that there's 168 hours for every one week.

00:00:14.525 --> 00:00:17.591
One way to think about
it is the ratio of hours

00:00:17.591 --> 00:00:21.708
for every week is 168 to
one, and then they calculate,

00:00:21.708 --> 00:00:24.041
well if we have 1,176 hours,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.181
how many weeks is that going to be?

00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:30.039
So pause this video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.956
Let's see, to go from 168 to 1,176,

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.921
what do we have to multiply by?

00:00:36.921 --> 00:00:39.977
So, let's see, that looks
like we might be multiplying

00:00:39.977 --> 00:00:40.810
by seven.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:42.893
Let me try that out.

00:00:42.893 --> 00:00:45.643
So 168 times seven is equal to...

00:00:47.386 --> 00:00:49.386
Eight times seven is 56,

00:00:50.806 --> 00:00:53.973
six times seven is 42 plus five is 47,

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:59.361
and then one times seven
plus four is indeed 1,176.

00:00:59.361 --> 00:01:01.949
So we multiplied by seven,
we multiplied the number

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.041
of hours by seven,

00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:06.572
so that means we're gonna have
seven times as many weeks.

00:01:06.572 --> 00:01:10.826
So, one times seven is
just that is seven weeks.

00:01:10.826 --> 00:01:13.146
Now, what about a situation
where we have three weeks,

00:01:13.146 --> 00:01:15.539
how many hours is that going to be?

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.521
Well we are multiplying
our weeks by three,

00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:22.802
so we would wanna multiply our hours.

00:01:22.802 --> 00:01:25.937
We would wanna multiply
our hours times three.

00:01:25.937 --> 00:01:27.604
So, 168 times three,

00:01:29.984 --> 00:01:32.614
eight times three is 24,

00:01:32.614 --> 00:01:35.781
six times three is 18, plus two is 20,

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.997
and then one times three
is three, plus two is five.

00:01:40.997 --> 00:01:43.330
So, that would be 504 hours.

00:01:44.931 --> 00:01:47.014
Let's do another example.

00:01:48.081 --> 00:01:51.501
So, here they tell us the double
number lines show the ratio

00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:53.510
of yards to miles.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.075
So, the ratio of yards to miles.

00:01:56.075 --> 00:02:00.242
It looks like we have 3,520
yards for every two miles.

00:02:02.887 --> 00:02:03.800
For every two miles,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.543
and you see that on this double
number line right over here.

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:09.567
Then they say how may
yards are in five miles?

00:02:09.567 --> 00:02:13.143
So, why don't you pause this
video and try to figure it out.

00:02:13.143 --> 00:02:14.932
Well the way my brain wants to do it is,

00:02:14.932 --> 00:02:18.126
well let's just think about
how many yard are in each mile.

00:02:18.126 --> 00:02:20.376
So, if the ratio's 3,520:2,

00:02:21.677 --> 00:02:25.159
how could I rewrite this
ratio so it is how many yards

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:26.556
for every one mile.

00:02:26.556 --> 00:02:29.642
So, to go from two to
one, I am dividing by two,

00:02:29.642 --> 00:02:32.566
so I would wanna divide
this by two as well.

00:02:32.566 --> 00:02:35.483
So, two goes into 3,520, let's see,

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:43.073
two goes into three one
time, one times two is two,

00:02:43.073 --> 00:02:46.561
you subtract, you bring down the five.

00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:50.146
Two goes into 15 seven
times, seven times two is 14,

00:02:50.146 --> 00:02:54.472
subtract, we have one,
bring down that two,

00:02:54.472 --> 00:02:59.066
two goes into 12 six
times, six times two is 12,

00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:00.973
and we subtract, no remainder,

00:03:00.973 --> 00:03:02.626
but then we're gonna
have one more zero here,

00:03:02.626 --> 00:03:04.494
cuz we bring down that zero.

00:03:04.494 --> 00:03:06.224
We say two goes into zero zero times,

00:03:06.224 --> 00:03:08.659
zero times two is zero,
and we have no remainder,

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.187
and so this is 1,760.

00:03:11.187 --> 00:03:13.698
So, we could put that here
on our double number lines.

00:03:13.698 --> 00:03:17.365
So, if we have one mile
that is 1,760 yards.

00:03:18.577 --> 00:03:20.312
Now, they're asking about five miles,

00:03:20.312 --> 00:03:24.153
so three, four, five,
so we have five miles.

00:03:24.153 --> 00:03:25.985
What is the number of yards?

00:03:25.985 --> 00:03:29.392
Well if you multiply by five here,

00:03:29.392 --> 00:03:33.362
you're also going to multiply
by five right over there.

00:03:33.362 --> 00:03:35.947
So, what's 1,760 times five?

00:03:35.947 --> 00:03:36.873
Well just figure it out.

00:03:36.873 --> 00:03:40.373
1,760 times five, five times zero is zero,

00:03:42.618 --> 00:03:44.368
five times six is 30.

00:03:46.623 --> 00:03:49.093
Regroup that three cuz it's really 300s,

00:03:49.093 --> 00:03:51.459
five times seven is 35,

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.478
plus three is 38, five times one is five,

00:03:55.478 --> 00:03:56.747
plus three is eight.

00:03:56.747 --> 00:03:59.247
So, there you go, 8,800 yards.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.257
Let's do a few more examples.

00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:09.808
Here, we're told there are
914.4 millimeters in a yard.

00:04:10.934 --> 00:04:13.321
There are three feet in a yard.

00:04:13.321 --> 00:04:16.238
How many millimeters are in a foot?

00:04:17.514 --> 00:04:18.834
Okay, so one way to think about it,

00:04:18.834 --> 00:04:22.917
you could say there's
914.4 millimeters per yard,

00:04:26.814 --> 00:04:30.981
or you could say 914.4
millimeters per three feet,

00:04:34.954 --> 00:04:37.828
since three feet and a
yard is the same thing.

00:04:37.828 --> 00:04:39.289
So, if you wanna know per foot,

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.987
you would just divide
both of these by three.

00:04:41.987 --> 00:04:42.820
So, let's do that,

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.125
and I'll just do it in
a different color here.

00:04:45.125 --> 00:04:49.292
Three goes into 914.4, Three
goes into nine three times,

00:04:52.368 --> 00:04:54.462
three times three is nine, subtract,

00:04:54.462 --> 00:04:57.130
we get a zero bring down the one,

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.231
three goes into one zero times,
zero times three is zero,

00:05:01.231 --> 00:05:05.059
subtract, get a one, and
bring down that four,

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:08.199
three goes into 14 four times,

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.427
gonna have this decimal right over here,

00:05:09.427 --> 00:05:13.842
four times three is 12,
you subtract, and then,

00:05:13.842 --> 00:05:16.532
so you get a two, bring down this four,

00:05:16.532 --> 00:05:18.204
you get a 24, and lucky for us,

00:05:18.204 --> 00:05:21.605
three goes perfectly into 24 eight times,

00:05:21.605 --> 00:05:23.605
eight times three is 24,

00:05:25.341 --> 00:05:26.674
24 you subtract,

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:28.815
now we have no remainder.

00:05:28.815 --> 00:05:32.565
So, we have 304.8
millimeters for every foot.

00:05:35.197 --> 00:05:37.364
Let's do one last example.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.264
So pause this video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:05:52.264 --> 00:05:54.193
So, let's just write this out in words.

00:05:54.193 --> 00:05:57.110
So, it's $12 per pound of confetti.

00:05:59.179 --> 00:06:02.762
So, you could do this
as $12 per 16 ounces.

00:06:04.186 --> 00:06:08.353
16 ounces of confetti, and
so if we want it per ounce.

00:06:10.788 --> 00:06:13.458
So, you could do this as a 12 to 16 ratio,

00:06:13.458 --> 00:06:16.071
but we wanna say something to one ratio.

00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:18.488
So, if you say per one ounce,

00:06:21.218 --> 00:06:23.831
well we're dividing by 16 there,

00:06:23.831 --> 00:06:26.976
so we would wanna divide by 16 as well.

00:06:26.976 --> 00:06:30.024
So, this is going to be 12 divided by 16.

00:06:30.024 --> 00:06:31.532
So, 12 divided by...

00:06:31.532 --> 00:06:33.422
Well let me write it over here.

00:06:33.422 --> 00:06:37.589
So 12 divided by 16 is
the same thing as 3/4,

00:06:39.707 --> 00:06:43.874
just divide both of them by
four, and so this is 0.75,

00:06:45.244 --> 00:06:47.911
or 75 cents, 75 cents per ounce,

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:53.143
or 75 hundredths of a dollar per ounce.

00:06:53.143 --> 00:06:55.226
So, 0.75, and we're done.
