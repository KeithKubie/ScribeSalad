00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.340
But the first network file system labelled NFS,

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.610
was built by Sun micro systems, which was

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.020
in the workstation business and it wanted a

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.830
solution. For uses files to be accessible over

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.480
a local area network. And so they built

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.770
the first ever network file system and called it,

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.777
very simply, NFS. And was built in 1985.
