00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.920
In the world of professional gambling, there
is a well documented hot streak of near-mythical

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.780
status referred to by many as “The Run”.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.820
During this streak, a man known as Archie
Karas turned $50 into $40 million by primarily

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.000
shooting pool and playing poker in Vegas.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.630
What makes this run so infamous is that, after
winning more money than most people could

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.599
spend in a lifetime, Karas lost it all in
the span of a few weeks.

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.620
The Run began in 1992 when Karas (aka: Anargyros
Karabourniotis) drove to Las Vegas with approximately

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.100
$50 in his pocket.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.050
The then 41 year old had originally come to
America from Greece via working aboard a cruise

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.160
ship as a waiter.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.370
Before that, he ran away from home at the
age of 15 after his father attacked him with

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.370
a shovel.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.200
Once in America, he developed prodigious skill
at both pool and poker, and several times

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.629
made himself a millionaire via gambling in
California, only to lose much of it shortly

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.629
thereafter.

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.750
Notably, directly before his famous trip to
Vegas, he managed to accumulate over $2 million

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.790
before losing most all of it playing poker.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.160
Rather than quit, he decided to head to Vegas
to try his luck there.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.840
archie-karasKaras’ previous experience playing
high-stakes poker helped him turn his $50

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.570
into $10,000 almost immediately when he bumped
into a high-roller at The Mirage he’d previously

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.190
played with and convinced him to give him
$10,000.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.960
The high-roller, knowing Karas’ skill, happily
lent him the money and watched as he turned

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.130
it into $30,000 in a matter of hours at the
poker tables.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.220
In repayment of the loan, Karas gave the man
$20,000 and headed for the pool halls with

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.260
the remaining $10,000.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.659
There Karas, who’d spent years hustling
people at pool while working next door to

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.530
a pool hall in LA, ran into a fellow pool
shark he has only ever referred to as “Mr.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.430
X” in interviews “out of respect for him
and his position.”

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.040
To quote Karas on he and Mr. X’s first encounter
in Vegas: “We knew each other from the past,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.070
and it took no time at all to agree to play
a game of 9-ball.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.200
We started shooting 9-ball for something pretty
small, like $5,000 per game.”

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.800
Over the course of about two and half months,
Karas and this mystery man met many dozens

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.100
of times to play pool for ever increasing
sums of money, eventually culminating in both

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.979
men agreeing to play for a whopping $40,000
per game, which inevitably resulted in hundreds

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.340
of thousands of dollars changing hands every
night.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:19.019
In one particularly heated set, according
to Karas, he lost $320,000 dollars in “about

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.320
40 seconds” when Mr. X was able to sink
the 9 ball on his break an astounding eight

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.100
times out of ten, something Karas had never
even heard of happening before.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.100
He stated of this,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.980
I don’t rattle easy, but that rattled me,
as I didn’t even get the chance to shoot

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.880
one ball in those games.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.830
It is hard to fade, believe me.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.201
It felt like I was throwing $40,000 at a time,
right out of a car window in seconds, over

00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:47.500
and over again, and my hard-earned money was
flying off into the wind.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.360
That said, Karas was still way ahead, having
netted around $1.2 million from Mr. X at this

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.360
point.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.919
Nonetheless, he decided Mr. X was simply too
good to beat consistently over a large sample

00:02:57.919 --> 00:02:58.919
set.

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:01.400
Knowing his opponent wouldn’t want to let
him walk away with over a million dollars

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.290
of his money, Karas offered to change the
game, telling Mr. X, “If you want to gamble

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.940
with me, let’s go play some poker.”

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.380
Like their pool games, the stakes between
both men quickly became high at upwards of

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.150
$15,000 per hand while playing seven card
stud- an amount Karas describes as “unheard

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.340
of in those days”.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.780
After three weeks of playing poker with Mr.
X and others, Karas had another $3 million

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.250
in his pocket from those games and the same
playing dice in between poker matches, bringing

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.720
his total up to $7 million in about three
months of gambling.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.000
Rather than retiring an living off the interest,
Karas set up shop at Binion’s Gambling Hall

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.250
and Hotel (then known as Binion’s Horseshoe)
and simply sat at the highest stakes poker

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.260
table with $5 million in chips in front of
him.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.880
To psyche out any potential opponents, Karas
would occasionally stand up and go to the

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.870
bar or toilet, leaving the $5 million on the
table like he didn’t even care about it.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.910
In reality, the money was being closely watched
over by casino security, but it did cause

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.840
enough of a stir to pique the interest of
some of the biggest poker stars of the day.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.320
Over the next six months, Karas won an additional
$10 million from some of the best card players

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.079
of all time including Stu Ungar (widely considered
the best Texas Hold ‘Em player ever), Chip

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.410
Reese (one of the youngest players ever inducted
into the poker hall of fame) and Johnny Chan

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.970
(one of only a handful of people in history
to have won the World Series of Poker main

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.000
event consecutively).

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.950
During this particular hot streak, Karas continually
tried to raise the stakes against his opponents

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.570
until he was playing half-million dollar games.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.030
While this earned him an undeniable amount
of kudos from his peers, it had the adverse

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.750
effect of ultimately scaring away nearly every
high-roller in Vegas.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.900
And so it was that after six months of dominating
high-stakes poker, losing only one major game

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.090
to Johnny Chan, Karas got bored of chasing
opponents and decided to take his $17 million

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.640
to the dice tables at the Binion Horseshoe,
as they prided themselves on allowing customers

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.301
to bet more money at once than any other casino
in Vegas.

00:04:51.301 --> 00:04:55.320
In the end, Karas was able to convince the
casino to allow him to bet $100,000 per dice

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.860
roll, 20 times more than any other casino
in the area offered and 5 times what other

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.910
customers at Binion’s could bet.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.650
Briefly, Karas even topped that after convincing
the owner to allow him to bet $200,000 on

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.840
a single roll- a concession that was quickly
rescinded when Karas won nearly a million

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.800
dollars in two consecutive rolls.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.940
On another occasion, Karas won almost every
$5000 chip (the largest at that establishment

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.970
at the time) the casino had and ultimately
walked out carrying $3 million in cash that

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.400
day which he nonchalantly dumped onto his
car’s passenger seat before driving to the

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.400
bank.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.530
(He did later note that he carried a gun with
him when walking around with large sums.)

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.760
At the end of this final streak, Karas had
managed to acquire another $13 million, bringing

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.600
his total winnings over this two and a half
year period to over $40 million (about $65

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.600
million today).

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.470
It’s at this point that his unprecedented
run stopped cold.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.310
Over the course of the next few weeks, Karas
lost about $17 million playing baccarat, $11

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.890
million playing dice and $2 million playing
poker against Johnny Chan.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.880
Just like that, 75% of his fortune was gone.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.690
These losses shook the normally ice cold Karas
enough to prompt him to return to his native

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.880
Greece for a few weeks to catch his breath.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.020
But the allure of Vegas and the highs of gambling
tempted him back and he proceeded to lose

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.510
another $10 million or so almost immediately
upon return, leaving him with about $1 million

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.510
to his name.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.690
Karas briefly regained his luck, winning about
$2 million in a single high-stake poker match

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.420
against Chan, but lost all these winnings
playing dice directly after.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:32.530
After this final losing streak, Karas was
broke; he’d lost just over $40 million in

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:33.740
about a month’s worth of gambling.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.340
By his own estimation, during The Run, Karas
gambled over a billion dollars.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.930
Whether true or not, the better documented
exploits during his streak would seem to indicate

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.610
he’s probably not far off when he states
he’s gambled more money than any single

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.650
human being in history, except for “people
on Wall Street”.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.800
As for why he continued when he could have
easily just walked away one of the richest

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.680
people in the world, Karas stated: “Money
means nothing to me.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.710
I don’t value it.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.470
I’ve had all the material things I could
ever want.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:02.470
Everything.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.130
The things I want, money can’t buy: health,
freedom, love, happiness.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.910
I don’t care about money, so I have no fear.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.110
I don’t care if I lose it.”

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.290
Showing that lack of fear, after losing that
$40 million, Karas continued gambling, managing

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:19.760
to win and lose millions of dollars a few
times over in the two decades since.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.950
Notable in these mini-runs was the time in
1996 when he turned $40,000 into about $5

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.840
million, then promptly lost it all the day
after winning approximately 80% of that sum.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.220
Unfortunately for Karas, he won’t be able
to go on any other such runs in Vegas for

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.490
the foreseeable future.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.490
Why?

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:40.250
In 2015, he was added to Nevada’s infamous
“Black Book” (a list of people banned

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.700
from ever gambling in the state) after being
found guilty of marking cards in a blackjack

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.590
game in 2013.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:51.370
In the end, Karas summed up his view on his
gambling career, “I consider myself the

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:52.600
king of gamblers.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:58.480
I made it, I lost it and like Frank Sinatra
says, I stood tall and I took the punches

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:14.820
and I did it my way.”
