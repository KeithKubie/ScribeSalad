&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The equation should be y equals 5 x plus 10. If you got that right, excellent

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:11.022
algebraic thinking. We know we pay $10, that's our fixed cost, the registration

00:00:11.022 --> 00:00:16.458
fee. The 5 times x comes from the $5 per hour. We pay $5 per every hour we drive

00:00:16.458 --> 00:00:21.976
the car. And, of course, if we add those two parts together we get y, our total

00:00:21.976 --> 00:00:22.411
cost.
