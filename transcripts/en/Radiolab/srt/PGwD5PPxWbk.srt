1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,720
You are listening to radio
lab radio from W N y.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,900
S. C h. N. P. R.

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,480
Hello David. Yes. Hello. This
is pat. Oh, hi pat. All right,

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,100
let's begin with this story from our
producer Pat Walters. Pat, go ahead. Okay.

5
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:24,570
So I heard this one from this guy
named David, Ms. David bus to ss.

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,380
He's a psychology professor at
the University of Texas at Austin.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,160
And this particular story, it comes
from a book that David wrote. Um,

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,660
could you just, just tell me, uh,

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,770
the little story that
you begin your book with?

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,250
Okay. Yes. Um, this is one
of the things that's, uh,

11
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,060
this was one of the things that sparked
my interest in the topic of murder.

12
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,750
The whole thing happened several
years ago. I had a very good friend,

13
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,430
another professor at the university,

14
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,210
and I used to socialize
with him and his wife.

15
00:00:55,211 --> 00:00:59,590
And one evening they were throwing
a party and invited me over.

16
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:02,920
And so, uh, when I went to the party,
a party was already in full swing.

17
00:01:02,921 --> 00:01:06,940
And I got there, uh, walked
in and asked his wife, uh,

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,520
where this friend of mine was. And, uh,

19
00:01:09,521 --> 00:01:14,500
she got a disgusted look on her face
and said that he was up in the bedroom.

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,660
And so I went up to the bedroom
to find them. And he was in a,

21
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,610
in a rage, in a rage.

22
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,980
How, like you walk into
the room, what do you find?

23
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,820
Well, he started, he started fuming
that his wife had, had dissed him.

24
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,840
And what did she do? Uh,

25
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,480
she expressed disapproval about his, uh,

26
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,600
clothing choices. She made
fun of his shirt or something,

27
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,590
but did it in publicly in front of
her friends. So it was a kind of,

28
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,450
he felt publicly humiliated.

29
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,740
And while David's sitting in
the bedroom with this friend,

30
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,580
the guy looks up at him and he
says, I'm going to kill her.

31
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:58,340
How did he say it? Like quietly
or like through his teeth,

32
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,300
you know, uh, I'm going to kill her.

33
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,750
David had always known this
guy to be pretty mild mannered,

34
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,740
but he is a, uh, a large,

35
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,910
very strong man, um,

36
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,970
with a black belt in karate.
I knew what he was capable of.

37
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:23,050
And so I suggested that we go out for a
walk and I basically spent the next half

38
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,530
hour walking around with
him, trying to cool him off.

39
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,660
And eventually he did.

40
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,510
He just calmed down.

41
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,490
And did you go back to the party then
and like continue dinner partying for

42
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,240
awhile? Yeah,

43
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,060
I did too. Yes. And he did too.

44
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,900
And then he seemed fine
when I said goodbye to him,

45
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:47,630
he seemed calm and I left and went home.

46
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,560
And then it was several hours later in
the middle of the night that I got the

47
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:56,240
call and it was his friend and he says,

48
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:01,270
can I come over and sleep on your couch
if I don't leave my house right now,

49
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,950
I'm going to kill her. He was in this, um,

50
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,870
a state of fury, he said, and um,

51
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,210
and instead of hitting his wife,

52
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,360
he smashed his fist into the bathroom
mirror and then realized that he had to

53
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:24,250
leave the house or he was
gonna do damage to her.

54
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,710
And, and so he says that in, you're
like, okay, yes, come over now.

55
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,790
Like, yeah, exactly.

56
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,580
Meanwhile, later that night
and the other side of town,

57
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,180
his wife went into hiding,

58
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,130
literally disappeared for six months
and didn't tell anyone where she was

59
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:43,590
because she was terrified
that he was gonna kill her.

60
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,940
This story made us
wonder, is David's friend,

61
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,420
is he unusual or just everybody at some
point have something dark in them that

62
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:59,590
just tiptoes out just
from time to time. Yeah.

63
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,270
This is Radiolab and today we're
going to get back so to speak.

64
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,340
We've done a good show.
This is the bad show.

65
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,190
So you asked like why
do people do bad things?

66
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,230
It actually mean to be bad anyways.

67
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:15,980
Like how do you tell the real bad ease
from the rest of us that time? Hour.

68
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,180
I'm Jad Abumrad I remember coach,
this is radio lab, the bad show.

69
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:28,370
[inaudible]

70
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,960
back to bed. Okay. Uh, so what happened
to David that night with his friend,

71
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,470
got him really curious about murder
and badness and all these things we're

72
00:04:36,471 --> 00:04:37,304
thinking about.

73
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,420
But it wasn't until a few years later
that he learned something that really put

74
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:44,270
what happened that night into
context. The next by this point,

75
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,080
David's moved on to a new university
and he's teaching an introductory

76
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:49,010
psychology class

77
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:54,090
and I devoted one class session to the
topic of homicide and why people kill.

78
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,330
And I designed a little, um,

79
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,630
questionnaire where I simply
asked the students, you know,

80
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:06,130
have you ever thought about killing
someone? And they would circle yes or no.

81
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,780
Then he left some space at the bottom
for them to elaborate if they said yes,

82
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,830
and, you know,

83
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:15,820
the class ended and I went back to my
office and I just sat at my desk and I

84
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:19,480
started reading these
and I was just astonished

85
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,740
to find page after page of
yeses and not just yeses,

86
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,120
but these very vivid descriptions
about who they would kill,

87
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,300
where they do it, when the precise method,

88
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,270
how many of them went
into that kind of detail?

89
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,810
Uh, I would say 75 or 80%. Wow. Um,

90
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,540
were you a little bit like
horrified? Like, oh my God,

91
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,840
my students are murderers. Alright. Well,

92
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,660
no, I, a horse horrified as
I was. I was pretty stunned.

93
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:53,810
And so I expanded the sample where we
asked about 5,000 people all over the

94
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:58,910
world. Singapore Heru the
UK. That same question,

95
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,830
have you ever thought
about killing someone?

96
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,700
And 91% of the men said yes.

97
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:07,040
And 84% of the women [inaudible]

98
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,660
said, yes, I've thought
about killing someone.

99
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,950
Yes.

100
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,270
If any sizable fraction actually
acted on their homicidal fantasies,

101
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:18,310
the streets would be running,
running red. [inaudible]

102
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,680
yeah, but that's just it.
Those are fantasies. Some
of them actually seem like,

103
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,400
well, here's one, something
more than just fantasies from

104
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,900
uh, a woman. Sure. Okay. This is
a 20 year old female. Uh, we ask,

105
00:06:31,901 --> 00:06:36,750
who did you think about killing?
And she said, my ex boyfriend, um,

106
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,360
we lived together for a couple
months. He was very aggressive.

107
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,960
He started calling me a whore and
told me he didn't love me anymore.

108
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,980
So I broke up with him. Then a few
months later he started calling me,

109
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,140
trying to get back together,
but I didn't want to.

110
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,680
He said that if I ever had a
relationship with another man,

111
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,720
he was going to send the videos of
us having sex to all the people in my

112
00:06:58,721 --> 00:07:02,710
university. The thing is that
I do have a new boyfriend,

113
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,750
but my ex boyfriend doesn't know it
that yet and I'm terrified that he'll do

114
00:07:07,751 --> 00:07:11,590
what he says. Then suddenly the
thought occurred to me that would,

115
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:16,270
my life would be much happier without
him and existence, and then she said,

116
00:07:16,271 --> 00:07:17,470
I actually did this.

117
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,030
I invited him for dinner and as he
was in the kitchen looking stupid,

118
00:07:22,031 --> 00:07:26,110
peeling the carrots to make salad,
I came up to him laughingly,

119
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:28,210
gently so that he
wouldn't suspect anything.

120
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,200
I thought about grabbing a knife
quickly and stabbing him in the chest

121
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:35,680
repeatedly until he was dead.
I actually did the first thing,

122
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,260
but he saw my intentions and ran away.

123
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,080
When asked how close she came to
killing him, she estimated 60%

124
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,300
60 I don't think I've ever had a fantasy
that that anatomically specific where I

125
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:56,150
would see the part of the other person
that I was going to stab or plan it like

126
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:56,840
that. Well.

127
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,410
Have you ever been blackmailed the way
this woman was being blackmailed? No.

128
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:03,920
No one has ever sent about a sex tape
that I've ever, no. So you don't know.

129
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,330
It is a fair question to ask.

130
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:10,480
What are the conditions under which
you or me or any of us could do awful

131
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,360
things. I think they'd have
to be extremely extreme. Well,

132
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,500
you know how my died?
No. And you know what?

133
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:19,090
This actually brings us to
our first top of the hour.

134
00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:21,280
So let me just to set it up. Robert,

135
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:24,580
I'm going to give you this piece
of paper here. What is this?

136
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,360
So these are some word pairs. Read these
words that use these words here. Yep.

137
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:33,130
Nice Day. Fat Neck. Yes. Sad face.

138
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:35,740
What is it? Soft hair. Yeah. I don't
know what this is. You just wear it,

139
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,400
period. I want you to commit them to
memory. Commit them to memory. You know,

140
00:08:39,401 --> 00:08:41,110
and while you're doing that,
just give me your finger.

141
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,730
I'm going to ask that first
little electro test finger.

142
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:48,170
Let me go hard there and just
wait a second. Clear air it.

143
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,770
Give me the paper back.
W already time's up.

144
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,210
So I'm just going to go into
this other room over here.

145
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:02,080
Can you hear me? All right. So I'm gonna
talk to you over this intercom. Okay?

146
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,440
I'm gonna give you a test. I'm not
ready for that attention. Right?

147
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:10,510
To the best of your memory, which
word was gnashed with knife?

148
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:15,150
Was it nice day. Nice sky. Nice job. Oh,

149
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,990
nice chair answer for you.

150
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,910
I don't [inaudible] just push the button
to correspond to the right way to go.

151
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,620
Okay. I'm choosing job. Wrong.

152
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,540
Answer is day hiring map to 185
votes have to give you a little bit.

153
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,240
What did you just hear? Drums.

154
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,780
Obviously no need to be an
alarm. That was not a real shock.

155
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,490
We were just enacting an old,

156
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,570
very famous experiment that you
might've heard about. It is May,

157
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,640
1962 done by this guy.

158
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,230
That experiment is being conducted in the
elegant interaction laboratory at Yale

159
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,550
University.

160
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,590
That's Stanley Milgram talking about the
experiment in the film in case you've

161
00:09:57,591 --> 00:10:00,860
never heard of, this probably happened
in case you haven't. Here's what he did.

162
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:02,210
He recruited a bunch of subjects.

163
00:10:02,211 --> 00:10:06,650
Subjects are 40 males between the ages
of 20 and 50 he's normal everyday dudes.

164
00:10:06,651 --> 00:10:10,400
The subjects range in occupation from
corporation presidents to good humor,

165
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,850
man in plumbers and you ran them through
something like what you and I just did.

166
00:10:13,851 --> 00:10:14,150
Right.

167
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:18,140
He would have each subject sit down
at a table right here in front of this

168
00:10:18,141 --> 00:10:22,590
really impressive looking machine machine
that had lots of switches on it. Oh,

169
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,700
generates electric shocks. When you press
one of the switches all the way down,

170
00:10:25,701 --> 00:10:29,660
the learner gets a shock and in the
other room there was a guy he called the

171
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:33,860
learner who is supposed to have memorized
some words and every time that guy got

172
00:10:33,861 --> 00:10:36,500
a word wrong like you just did. Yep.

173
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:41,530
Tapping Casa volunteer was instructed
to shock that guy with higher and higher

174
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:47,000
voltage. Now the volunteer couldn't
see the guy. He was shocking,

175
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,680
but he could definitely hear him
Milgrom stage. The whole thing,

176
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:54,110
like it was some experiment
about memory and punishment,

177
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:57,800
but of course it wasn't
about that until you please.

178
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,660
It was about how far
would these people go,

179
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:05,020
how many times would they shock that sad
SAP in the next room just because they

180
00:11:05,211 --> 00:11:08,450
were being told Tim guy yelling,

181
00:11:08,451 --> 00:11:10,760
of course was an actor and
the shocks weren't real,

182
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:15,790
but the questions in the air at the
time were very real prosecution.

183
00:11:16,311 --> 00:11:20,390
The attorney general, this is a moment
when human cruelty was on trial.

184
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,440
Quite literally when I stand before
you judges of Israel in this court,

185
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,440
I used to accuse or don't five
from them and any or maybe he did.

186
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,960
I do not stand alone.

187
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,370
The Milgrim actually begins these
experiments the same year that [inaudible]

188
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:43,270
Eichmann goes on trial for Nazi war
crimes. That's radio producer Ben Walker.

189
00:11:43,271 --> 00:11:46,890
He'll be our guide for the segment
and in the trial when the prosecutors

190
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:51,340
essentially ask him how you
came to commit genocide,

191
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,110
he would say over over again,
it was not my Greyson on a fair.

192
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,660
I was just following orders.

193
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:02,500
I had to do what I was
ordered and it's this defense.

194
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:07,830
This is basically what Stanley Milgrom
set out to test 185 volts in a lab at

195
00:12:08,981 --> 00:12:11,140
Yale University. With a
bunch of regular Americans.

196
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,983
Okay.

197
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:17,230
Like is that something that's universal?
Yeah. Or just 10 Eichmann thing. Yeah.

198
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,670
He figured maybe 1% of these men would
keep flicking the switches up to the

199
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:22,540
highest voltage,

200
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,880
but yeah,

201
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,280
that's not what he found.

202
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:31,340
65% were willing to shock their fellow
citizens over and over again even past

203
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:36,450
when they were screaming in pain.

204
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,000
Sounds happened to that man in there.

205
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,380
Even when they stopped screaming.
Yeah. When they were maybe dead.

206
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,770
You better try and get on him. Sir.
You want to answer me or nothing?

207
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,050
Please continue. Go on please.

208
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,880
They continued shocking there

209
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,083
corpses.

210
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,680
His experiment remains one of the most
famous experiments of the 20th century in

211
00:13:01,411 --> 00:13:06,411
1962 Stanley Milgrom shocked the world
because his study on obedience is still

212
00:13:06,601 --> 00:13:11,130
trotted out to explain everything
from hazing to war crimes.

213
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,660
What is there in human nature to gang
behavior allows an individual to act

214
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:20,460
inhumanely genocide harshly. It's
like a downloadable from the Internet.

215
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,730
Instant defense for doing wrong, but

216
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,540
if you look at Milgram's work
closely. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

217
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,720
Like this guy did, oh x,

218
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,000
how's Lim professor of psychology
at the University of Exeter?

219
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,640
Then a different picture will emerge.

220
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,900
Really that story has been told
1,000,001 times for the last 50 years.

221
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:42,490
We've just got to get out.
Got To get out of here.

222
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,870
Now what you need to understand about
Alex Haslam is that he hates it when

223
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:50,380
interviewers only want to
talk about the baseline study.

224
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,310
The one that everybody knows, the
so called baseline, the 65% one,

225
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,690
the one we just talked about. Yeah. So
there's more, there's more to it. Yeah,

226
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,910
because actually he studied between 20
and 40 different variants of this same

227
00:14:03,431 --> 00:14:07,270
paradigm. Stanley Milgrim took
electric shock with very seriously.

228
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:12,280
He did this experiment a bunch of
times and a bunch of different ways,

229
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,250
had all sorts of different things that
you would change where the shocker and

230
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:16,300
the Shaki Sat.

231
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:20,620
Yet women participantcy had an
experimental who wasn't a scientist,

232
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:24,370
but it was a member of the general
public and every scenario produced a

233
00:14:24,371 --> 00:14:29,060
different result. Really? Yup.
Let me, I mean, I'm just, uh,

234
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:32,480
I've got in front of me, I've just got
the, uh, the data from the Milgram study.

235
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:34,400
Let me just get that
out. I mean, so again,

236
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,420
the baseline studies is the one where
65% of the volunteers go all the way,

237
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:42,590
highest dose of electricity x, x,
x. But in experiment number three,

238
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,150
if they put the Shockey in the
same room with the shocker,

239
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:51,500
so the shocker could actually see the
person that he's shocking obedience tropes

240
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:54,770
to about 40% and in
experiment number four,

241
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,130
when the teacher has to hold the
learner's hand down on the plate,

242
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:02,990
in order for him to feel the
shock, it drops to about 30%. Wow.

243
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,250
Experiment 14. If the experiments
are, he is not a scientist,

244
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:12,230
but is an ordinary man not wearing a
white coat, obedience drops to 20%.

245
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,450
Well, how low can we go? Okay,
here's another one. Experiment 17.

246
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,620
There's you and there's two
other participants, both actors.

247
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,230
If those two participants
refuse to go on, like saying,

248
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:29,750
I don't want to kill a guy, boney
10% under those circumstances, go on.

249
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,360
And then the final one,
experiment 15 of course,

250
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,210
normally you just have one experiment
who's giving you these instructions.

251
00:15:35,211 --> 00:15:39,170
But if you put two experimenters in the
room and they start disagreeing with

252
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:44,000
each other and this one you get 0% going
all the way. Zero in that condition.

253
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:48,750
You said Zero Nolan and go right to
the unknown at one person, not assault.

254
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,480
Exactly. 0% well, all right,

255
00:15:51,481 --> 00:15:55,550
I'm starting to feel a little bit better
about my fellow man. One second. Hey,

256
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,920
okay. Where is he?

257
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,390
Am I'm in a closet closet cause this room
is echoey and you know there's nothing

258
00:16:03,391 --> 00:16:07,230
like a closet full of clothes to like
help balance that out. That's true.

259
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,140
That's true. All right,
keep going. So you see,

260
00:16:10,141 --> 00:16:15,090
it's just in that one experiment that
65% of people are willing to go all the

261
00:16:15,091 --> 00:16:18,030
way. But in all of these
other scenarios they don't.

262
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,630
And even when they do say yes, even
when they go along with the experiment,

263
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,050
as you can see in the film, they struggle

264
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,670
using the last switch on the board.
Please. I'm not getting no answer.

265
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,650
Please continue. The next word is white.

266
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,190
They have debates with themselves.

267
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,910
Please debates with the experimenter.

268
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,270
Not once we started the
experiment, something's happened.

269
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,910
Then man attacked or something on that.

270
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,960
The experiment requires that we
continue to go on and put the man's,

271
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,120
help me in anything, whether the
learner likes it or not. We [inaudible].

272
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,930
What's interesting is that
how all of these struggles,

273
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,140
all of them play out the same way.

274
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:59,730
It's the experimenter
prodding the shockers along.

275
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,840
Yeah. Nothing came together on
what? 450 volts every shot now.

276
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,950
Correct. For me, it's all
about the prods connect words.

277
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,750
This is what totally
pulled me into this story.

278
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,140
Prods Stanley Milgrom had four scripted
prods that he wrote out for his

279
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,470
experimenters for when the subjects
didn't want to continue. Yup.

280
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,010
The first one was,

281
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,780
please go on and if they
didn't go on, if they resisted,

282
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,050
he experimented, would break
out prod and number two,

283
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,690
the experiment requires that you continue.

284
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,340
Well, the experiment requires a
lot. I mean, I know it does, sir,

285
00:17:32,341 --> 00:17:35,040
but I mean he's up to 195 o's

286
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:39,340
and if they still were resisting or
struggling, they'd get prod number three.

287
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,520
It's absolutely essential
that you continue.

288
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,800
Absolutely essential. Like you
can tell a little bit more direct.

289
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,220
It's a bit stronger. It's not
an order, but the fourth prod,

290
00:17:48,221 --> 00:17:50,040
really the the critical, the critical

291
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,950
false prod is an absolute
order. The fourth prod is

292
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:57,480
you got to know where the choice
teacher, you have no other choice.

293
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:02,290
Choice teacher, you must continue.
That is definitely an order.

294
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,060
Exactly, but every time the experiment
are pulled out, the fourth prod,

295
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,420
and this was confirmed when the
experiment was redone in 2006

296
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,100
total disobedience, Hodel disobedient.

297
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:19,510
Anytime the experimenter said you
must continue, the shocker would say,

298
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,050
hell no. I've

299
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,170
don't. You have no other choice
teacher. I have a choice.

300
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,040
I'm not going to go ahead with it.

301
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,860
Well, we'll have to discontinue
the experiment then. I'm sorry.

302
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,633
Here's another one.

303
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,950
You have no other choice.
You must go to have a choice.

304
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:41,980
How does, if you don't continue,

305
00:18:41,981 --> 00:18:46,450
what we're going to have to discontinue
the experiment after he says cut it out.

306
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:50,460
After all he knows what he
can stand. That's my opinion.

307
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,610
That's where I'm going to stand on it.

308
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:57,370
So the subjects seem willing
to shock another human being,

309
00:18:57,371 --> 00:19:02,170
but as soon as you say it's an order,
they don't do it. Now that's important.

310
00:19:02,171 --> 00:19:05,530
It's very important because if
you ask university undergraduates,

311
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,180
what does the Milgram study show?

312
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,110
They will invariably say something like
they show that people obey orders. Okay.

313
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:14,500
Well actually the one thing that the
study really doesn't show is that people

314
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:19,400
are, Bay audit is a pretty big thing. To
me. This is a pretty big thing to miss,

315
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,490
isn't it? Really? See, wait,

316
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:26,340
if it doesn't show that people
are just obeying orders. Yeah,

317
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,590
and what does it show? Okay. I think
it looks, it's like this. All right,

318
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,440
let's go into our instruction.
We will begin with this test.

319
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:37,300
The participants are there in the, in
the study, I've got a very plausible,

320
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:41,170
very credible high-status scientist and
as I say, it's a scientific institution.

321
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,470
Yale, who is going to do this
powerful piece of science,

322
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,270
direct your voice toward
that microphone is the room.

323
00:19:46,271 --> 00:19:49,870
So they sit down in the chair thinking,
wow, this is really important.

324
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:54,730
I'm about to help this quest
for knowledge. I really
want to do a good job. Now,

325
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,710
as we sort of know in life,

326
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,550
lots of things that we do if they
worthwhile doing and not always easy.

327
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,150
And you find yourself in a situation
where you've got to do something that's

328
00:20:04,151 --> 00:20:07,420
hard, like shocking, an
innocent stranger over and over.

329
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,340
But if you think that's the right thing,

330
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:13,000
if you think that science is
worth pursuing, you say, okay,

331
00:20:13,001 --> 00:20:13,930
I'll go along with this.

332
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,160
So you're saying they are shocking
these people because they thought it was

333
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:21,280
worthwhile. Look, the participants,
you know, they're not, it's not.

334
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,520
It's not just blind or beaten. So,
oh, you tell me. So yes sir. No Sir.

335
00:20:24,521 --> 00:20:25,360
Three bags full sir.

336
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,340
They're engaged with the task that
trying to be good participants.

337
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,940
They're trying to do the right thing.

338
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,780
They're not doing something
because they have to.

339
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,390
They're doing it because
they think they ought to.

340
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,480
And that's all the
difference in the world.

341
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,100
Suddenly I'm thinking this

342
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,490
is actually a darker interpretations.
Say original. Absolutely darker.

343
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,980
They are doing it. No question
about it. They have the agency. Yup.

344
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,110
And they think it's right.

345
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,760
Although clearly they on
some level they know it isn't

346
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,730
does this sort of chilling comparison,

347
00:21:00,731 --> 00:21:05,731
which is a speech that Himmler gave to
the SS cmss leaders when they were about

348
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:09,280
to commit a range of
atrocities. And he said, look,

349
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:12,250
this is what you're going to do is
of course you don't want to do this.

350
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:16,390
Of course nobody wants to be killing
other people and we realize this is hard

351
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:16,930
work.

352
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:21,250
But what you're doing is for the good of
Germany and this is necessary in order

353
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:23,920
to advance our noble cause.

354
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,293
Wow.

355
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,680
So then, hey wait, I'm almost done
guys. Give me two more minutes.

356
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,110
Two more minutes. So in the mailroom case,

357
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:35,280
[inaudible] with the ideas that people
will do bad if they think it's good,

358
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:39,330
like the good Nobel cause. Well what's
the noble cause in this case? Science.

359
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:40,140
Science.

360
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:44,040
You can see this in the surveys that
the men filled out after the experiments

361
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,950
were over. This was exactly what
was on my mind. If the experiment,

362
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:51,060
if the experiment had to be
successful, it had to be carried on.

363
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,960
The questionnaires they filled out are
part of the Milgrim archive at Yale.

364
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,170
I'm willing to help in
a worthwhile experiment.

365
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,870
And it's Kinda surprising.

366
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:05,520
A lot of them are really positive even
though they've just been told that they

367
00:22:05,521 --> 00:22:09,030
were duped. Research
in any field is a must,

368
00:22:09,031 --> 00:22:10,740
particularly in this day and age.

369
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,520
Do you think that more studies of this
sort should be carried out? Definitely,

370
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,383
yes.

371
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:20,660
We as, as onlookers to this study,
we have this kind of Godlike, uh,

372
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,040
sort of vision of like, well, of
course what they're doing is wrong,

373
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,560
but if it looks at it
from another perspective,

374
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:29,280
there's a sense in which you could
celebrate what they're doing. I mean,

375
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,630
I'm not suggesting one should,

376
00:22:30,631 --> 00:22:34,020
but I'm just saying there is a sense in
which these people are prepared to do

377
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:37,620
something that's very painful to them
and to someone else because they want to

378
00:22:37,621 --> 00:22:40,680
promote science. Well, you know, you
can see that's a good thing. I mean,

379
00:22:40,681 --> 00:22:41,514
you know

380
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:46,870
God cause it's like we started with this
experiment that we all see as evidence

381
00:22:46,911 --> 00:22:51,020
of humans, latent capacity for
evil. You tell us actually no,

382
00:22:51,021 --> 00:22:55,040
under some circumstances we don't do
the bad thing we're told to do because

383
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:58,520
here's another flip. We don't have to
be told, in fact, we hate being told,

384
00:22:58,521 --> 00:23:01,520
but we will do it on our own
if we think it's good. Yeah.

385
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,010
Now you're saying actually
that you could read that,

386
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,480
that very dark fact as being actually
evidence of something quite quite noble.

387
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,120
Well, if you dressed it up and if
you just had some minor variance,

388
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,750
the paradigm, you could presumably
make, you know, make this out these up.

389
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,890
These are people who are
incredibly noble. They are,

390
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,370
I mean it's the fact of course that
they're administering pain to a stranger.

391
00:23:19,371 --> 00:23:20,780
That's what's horrifying about it.

392
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,850
But imagine they were
administering paint themselves.

393
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,490
Imagine they were really where I had
to administer shocks themselves or

394
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:27,230
something. But if they
were prepared to do that,

395
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,930
when I suspect a lot of them
would, um, then we'd say,

396
00:23:29,931 --> 00:23:32,540
these are people who really believe in
Saas and isn't this a good thing that we

397
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:37,541
have people in our society who are
willing to make sacrifices for the greater

398
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:38,684
good?

399
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,813
Hmm.

400
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,510
So in the end, where do you come down?

401
00:23:41,511 --> 00:23:46,060
Do you leave this experiment in a light
mood or an a dark mood? Uh, I, th I,

402
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,530
I overall, I would say in a powerful mood,

403
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,220
we're close to some really fundamental
truths about human nature. And you know,

404
00:23:52,221 --> 00:23:56,780
my views about human nature is that it
affords infinite potentials for lightness

405
00:23:56,781 --> 00:23:59,750
and dark. There's lots and lots of lessons
here, but one is, I think, you know,

406
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:03,020
when you're enjoined to do
something for the greater good,

407
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,200
maybe ask yourself the question,
what is greater and what is good?

408
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,410
Oh, that right there. Slap
some quotations around that.

409
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,420
Yeah. Yeah.

410
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,150
[inaudible]

411
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:23,430
right. Thanks to Ben Walker whose podcast
he has a podcast and it's a good one.

412
00:24:23,431 --> 00:24:26,400
It's called too much information.
Yes, it's awesome. Thank you Ben.

413

Thank you very much.

430
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,200
Oh, okay. They're going
to record it over. I mean,

431
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,050
I'm going to record it here
too. All three, two, one.
Hey, I'm Janna. Boom. Ron,

I'm Robert Krulwich. This
is radio lab and today evil,

433
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,680
although I don't know if that's the
right word for this next thing. Yeah.

434
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,290
Cause it's sort of more complicate
when you call someone evil,

435
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:50,720
then you're kind of done with
them. But there's been a fellow,

436
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,360
I've been thinking about him from
better part of the year as you know,

437
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:58,340
[inaudible] such a puzzle to me.
I can't quite please him though.

438
00:25:58,341 --> 00:26:03,020
It's very fun to try. And uh, I heard
about him from science writers, Sam Keen.

439
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:07,250
Well let's talk about Fritz Haber. So,
so first of all, could you just like, uh,

440
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,790
when did he live and what did he
look like and that kind of stuff?

441
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,050
Uh, he was doing his,

442
00:26:13,051 --> 00:26:18,051
his great science work right around
the turn of the 20th century.

443
00:26:19,051 --> 00:26:24,051
So right around 1900 very distinctive
looking man bald on top trim,

444
00:26:24,391 --> 00:26:28,560
nice mustache. Wore a little, um,
uh, peas Nez. Is that how you say?

445
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,740
Is that [inaudible] so
I'm not sure if, okay.

446
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,720
One of those very tiny old fashioned,

447
00:26:33,721 --> 00:26:35,970
a pair of glasses that
would pinch on your nose.

448
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,890
And he was someone who
had very big ambitions.

449
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:45,480
Just to put that in context, they bring
a few other of our storytellers in.

450
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:48,450
He comes from Breslau, Germany,
that's Fred Kaufman reporter,

451
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:53,210
which is a fairly small, you know,
smaller sort of town. And uh,

452
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,580
so does Clara. That's for topper's wife.
We're going to meet her later, right?

453
00:26:56,581 --> 00:27:00,270
Clara comes from the same town
and they're both secularized Jews.

454
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,010
But this was a moment in German history.

455
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:04,740
He says when Jews had a
decent amount of freedom,

456
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,710
and this is the difference between
Kaiser Wilhelm and of course Hitler's

457
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:11,290
Germany. Yeah, put it in context.
Dan Charles, he's a historian.

458
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,520
His was the first generation when a young
Jewish boy could truly imagine that he

459
00:27:15,521 --> 00:27:18,160
could just be a regular
part of that society.

460
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,710
He could do anything and he
believed it. Fast forward,

461
00:27:22,711 --> 00:27:26,890
10 years for topper is a professor, small
university is working with chemicals.

462
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,790
It's about 1880.

463
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:31,120
And he throws himself with one of the
central issues facing Germany that at that

464
00:27:31,121 --> 00:27:34,790
time Germany has a problem, a big problem.

465
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,850
It has enough what they used to
call then solar energy, you know,

466
00:27:37,851 --> 00:27:42,470
energy from the sun to grow crops
to feed about 30 million people.

467
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,130
However, that leaves
behind 20 million Germans.

468
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,190
Do you mean they're looking at
20 million people going hungry?

469
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,980
That's what we're heading towards. I
mean you have to remember it during the,

470
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,240
during the Crimean war in
the 1850s Europe starves,

471
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,090
so around the turn of the century
for German scientists like hopper,

472
00:28:01,091 --> 00:28:05,010
this was the challenge. He is, he wants
to feed, he wants to feed Germany,

473
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,900
and actually this wasn't
just a German thing.

474
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:10,230
A lot of people were beginning to worry
that with about a billion and a half

475
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:14,940
people on the planet at that point that
maybe we were maxing out that the earth

476
00:28:14,941 --> 00:28:17,190
couldn't support this many people
and everyone thought, well,

477
00:28:17,191 --> 00:28:21,600
we know the solution. Yeah, we just need
a whole lot more of one simple element.

478
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:25,320
Nitrogen, nitrogen, nitrogen,
nitrogen, they needed more nitrogen.

479
00:28:25,321 --> 00:28:29,250
Nitrogen is an essential part
of amino acids and proteins.

480
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,830
And when you stick a seed
like wheat seed in the ground,

481
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,240
one of the reasons that grows is because
it's sucking up all the nitrogen in the

482
00:28:36,241 --> 00:28:39,630
soil to make it cell
walls. Without nitrogen,

483
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,410
you don't have life. Now,

484
00:28:43,411 --> 00:28:46,020
of course you could find it
some nitrogen out in the world.

485
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:49,790
Natural deposits would be like
seaweed or manure was one. You know,

486
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:51,680
you could find it in cow
manure or [inaudible],

487
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:56,580
which was basically poop and seagull
poop, which made that poop valuable.

488
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:00,630
And actually two nations in
South America went to war,

489
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:05,550
literally over bet. You could say
people were crazy, by the way.

490
00:29:05,551 --> 00:29:09,480
That's reporter Latif Nasr you know,
this was like oil is today. This is,

491
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,660
everybody was desperate for
sources, new sources of nitrogen,

492
00:29:12,661 --> 00:29:14,760
and to make the problem
even more annoying,

493
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:19,340
the most common source of
nitrogen is in the air around us.

494
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,493
[inaudible]

495
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:21,990
ah,

496
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:26,980
it makes up four out of every five
or so molecules that we breathe.

497
00:29:26,981 --> 00:29:28,750
So it's very a lot. Yes.

498
00:29:28,751 --> 00:29:32,140
80% of the air is nitrogen atoms.

499
00:29:32,141 --> 00:29:36,010
So all the nitrogen you'd
ever need, what's right there.

500
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:40,660
You can't like throw that air onto
a plant. They couldn't deploy it.

501
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,600
They deploy it, meaning they
couldn't capture it. That's right.

502
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,670
And part of the problem here,

503
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,160
and although once again we're
getting a little ahead of ourselves,

504
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,500
we'll be right back to that. But,
but wait, wait, let's just finish.

505
00:29:50,501 --> 00:29:55,210
This is that is that
nitrogen is try Vaillant try,

506
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,040
try Vaillant. In other words,

507
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:02,130
nitrogen has really strong
attachments to itself.

508
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:05,740
And what he means is that when nitrogen
atoms are just free floating in the air,

509
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:07,450
they will clean to each other.

510
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:11,050
These little nitrogen atoms will
fiercely hold together and it's almost

511
00:30:11,051 --> 00:30:14,680
impossible to pry them apart.
His calculations showed
that it couldn't be done,

512
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,230
at least not without a
tremendous amount of energy,

513
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:22,030
more energy than seem like possible
to make. Yeah. Yes. But you know,

514
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,870
being ambitious harbor starts
thinking, in order to do this,

515
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:30,190
we need to Ah, pressure this. We need
to put it under a lot of pressure.

516
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,660
So he starts experimenting.

517
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,620
He figures out a way to take a lot of
air that's filled with these little

518
00:30:35,621 --> 00:30:40,621
nitrogen bonds clinging to each other
and pump it with big iron pig under

519
00:30:41,351 --> 00:30:46,351
extreme extreme pressure at
high temperature and then
he forces hydrogen into

520
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:50,530
the tech. Get in there and you
have a number of chemical reactions

521
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:58,140
and what happens is that you're elbowing
the nitrogen apart from excel and then

522
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,810
forcing it to on [inaudible]

523
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:09,700
with the hydrogen in a new way. And when
hydrogen and nitrogen bond together,

524
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,580
the thing you get is ammonia,

525
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,470
a liquid that is captured the
nitrogen right out of the air.

526
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:21,010
You literally get a drip, drip,

527
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,130
drip of ammonia.

528
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,270
Oh

529
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,070
it is.

530
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:35,070
It is arguably the most significant
scientific breakthrough of the mall bred

531
00:31:36,941 --> 00:31:41,650
from the air was the phrase cause hopper
had figured out a way to take nitrogen

532
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:46,320
from the air, put it into the
barren ground and grill. Wait,

533
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:51,430
this has allowed the world
to have 7 billion people.

534
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:57,510
This is what's driving the
world towards 10 12 by 2050

535
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,293
[inaudible]

536
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,360
now we're seeing about a hundred million
tons of synthetic fertilizer produced

537
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:08,350
industrially each year.

538
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:11,980
And that tonnage is then
moves into our food source.

539
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:16,660
Our food source then moves into our
bodies and the rough statistics are that

540
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,800
half of each of our
bodies contains nitrogen.

541
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,870
It's from the harbor process. No, really

542
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:29,730
[inaudible]

543
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:34,650
and so in 1918 fritz hopper gets
a Nobel prize, but this is my,

544
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:37,590
this is such an interesting
guy. Around the same time,

545
00:32:37,591 --> 00:32:39,030
officials in the u s government

546
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,200
are calling him a war criminal.

547
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,190
[inaudible]

548
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,870
all right. Just to back up for one
second, after Hopper's nitrogen discovery,

549
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,170
he was promoted. You know,

550
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:56,460
he takes over the leadership of this
institute in Berlin and he starts

551
00:32:56,461 --> 00:33:00,870
hobnobbing with a whole different level
of society that Stan Charles Again,

552
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,850
I mean, it's a pretty
heady thing for, you know,

553
00:33:02,851 --> 00:33:07,851
a Jewish kid from Breslau to be
hobnobbing with the emperor and cabinet

554
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:12,990
ministers. He's part of the club
and he really, really relished it.

555
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,080
And not just because he was vain,
which everyone agrees he was,

556
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:20,550
but because he loves his country. He
loves the fatherland and he loves Germany.

557
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,250
So when World War One begins,

558
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:27,390
he signs up immediately sends a
letter volunteering for duty saying,

559
00:33:27,391 --> 00:33:30,330
you know the process that
I use to make food. Well,

560
00:33:30,331 --> 00:33:33,600
I can use that same
process to make explosives

561
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,780
because the thing that you put into the
ground to grow more food is also the

562
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:40,490
thing you can explode to make a bomb.

563
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,900
That's correct because it takes such
energy and pressure to separate it.

564
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,410
This try Vaillant bond is so strong
that when it comes back together,

565
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,730
that energy that's released,

566
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:57,320
it can be used for life or death.

567
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,880
In any case, back to World War
One, there's trench warfare.

568
00:34:01,881 --> 00:34:05,240
It gets bogged down
and harbor has an idea.

569
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:09,140
It goes straight to the German high
command and he and he pitches this idea.

570
00:34:09,141 --> 00:34:10,040
He says, well,

571
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:14,570
we can drive those enemy soldiers
out of trenches with gas.

572
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:18,530
Chlorine gas will basically bring
it to the front and when the,

573
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,900
when the wind is right,
we'll just spray it.

574
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,740
But the generals were not all that
convinced now. They just didn't like it.

575
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,080
A lot of them were like, this
is not how you fight a war.

576
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,010
It's like playing dirty
sort of unsportsmanlike.
But he organizes soldiers.

577
00:34:32,011 --> 00:34:36,870
He organizes whole gas units and no one
even had to ask takes command of them.

578
00:34:36,871 --> 00:34:41,460
Partially he travels to the
front. And on April 22nd,

579
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,880
1950 and 1915 Hubbard finds
himself in a little town in Belgium

580
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:49,420
called e, y. P. R. E. S. Actually
the Americans called it Yips,

581
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,290
whatever you call it.

582
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:55,290
This was one of the bloodiest
arenas on the western front.

583
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,980
The Germans were on one side, the fringe,

584
00:34:56,981 --> 00:34:58,450
the Canadians and the
British on the other.

585
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:04,110
And there behind the German lines is
our, our friend, our friend of me,

586
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:08,290
uh, for topic, our friend,
he's bald. He has a pot belly.

587
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:13,450
He has these [inaudible] spectacles.
He's chomping on a Virginian Cigar.

588
00:35:13,451 --> 00:35:16,630
He was always smoking these Virginians
cigars and he's wearing a fur coat

589
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,420
really? And what is basically
like the Baghdad of his time.

590
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,690
But nobody had done

591
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,800
what he was about to do on the
scale that he was about to do it.

592
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:32,160
So basically at 6:00 PM on April
22nd when the wind was just right,

593
00:35:32,161 --> 00:35:36,450
he says harbors gas troops on
unscrew, they opened the valve

594
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:44,420
on almost 6,000 tanks
containing 150 tons of chlorine.

595
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,820
That's like an adult
blue whale of chlorine.

596
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,540
Just trying to imagine
that as that like a,

597
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,950
like a green cloud does that some people
describe it as a cloud and then others

598
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:57,951
describe it as this kind of 15 foot wall
kind of hugging the land and it's just

599
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:03,291
sort of approach and it's moving at about
one meter per second and according to

600
00:36:03,451 --> 00:36:06,150
some accounts as it crept
across no man's land,

601
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:11,180
the leaves would just sort of shrivel
and the grass was turning to the color of

602
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:12,114
metal.

603
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:17,840
Birds would just fall from the air
within minutes the gas reached the allied

604
00:36:18,321 --> 00:36:19,520
side and as soon as it did,

605
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:27,510
soldiers began to convulse. They
were gagging, they were choking,

606
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,610
hundreds of them were
falling to the ground.

607
00:36:29,611 --> 00:36:33,810
What is the guest doing to them exactly?
I think what it's doing is it's a,

608
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,980
if you breathe it in,

609
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:38,970
it sort of irritates your lungs to the
extent that they sort of fills up with

610
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,380
fluid so quickly that you sort of drown
in your own flam sitting like actually

611
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,020
drowning, literally drowning on land. Wow.

612
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:48,900
Yellow Mucus was frothing
out of their mouth.

613
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,560
Those who could still
breathe would turn blue.

614
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:57,800
This is the description of hell yeah.

615
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,640
But harbor solid has a
wonderful success and wished,

616
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:06,890
wished that the Germans had been better
prepared to exploit it because he felt

617
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:11,330
like they really could have made a
terrific advance if they had had more

618
00:37:11,331 --> 00:37:12,164
confidence

619
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,720
and he is celebrated for it.

620
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:21,080
He gets promoted to the rank of captain
and he goes home for a few days a hero.

621
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:26,790
But when he gets there, he has to
contend with his wife, Clara Emma Var,

622
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:31,650
Clara also from Breslau office, also from
a Jewish family and also a scientist.

623
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:31,950
Huh.

624
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:36,870
Unusually so in those times she was
actually a sort of a genius herself.

625
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:41,670
She was one of the first women
to earn a phd in her country.

626
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:46,540
And shortly after his return, Clara
allegedly confronts him and says, look,

627
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:50,200
you are morally bankrupt.
How could you? Um,

628
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:54,250
but Haber just kind of ignored
her. And according to legend,

629
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:59,280
he actually threw a dinner party
in celebration of the big victory,

630
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:03,190
invited his friends over. Now we don't
actually know if he threw a party.

631
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,650
Like I consider that apocryphal.
Dan doesn't think so.

632
00:38:05,651 --> 00:38:08,740
But what's clear is that he saw no
reason to question what he had done.

633
00:38:08,741 --> 00:38:13,741
And that infuriated Clara especially
because she found out he was leaving the

634
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:17,350
next day to direct more gas attacks and
they'd probably had an argument. Yeah,

635
00:38:17,351 --> 00:38:19,870
undoubtedly. They had an argument
that's historian Fritz Stern,

636
00:38:19,871 --> 00:38:23,650
who also happens to be fritz Hopper's
Godson. They had a quarrel more than that,

637
00:38:23,651 --> 00:38:24,520
let's call it a fight.

638
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:28,630
And later that night after the party
harbor takes a bunch of sleeping pills and

639
00:38:28,631 --> 00:38:30,550
goes to sleep. Um,

640
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:34,750
and she takes a service revolver,

641
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,800
if it's pistol walks
outside to the garden and

642
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:42,740
pulls the trigger,

643
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:47,270
shoots herself in the chest
and is found by her son,

644
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,740
by her son. Yes. Age to teen, I think. Uh,

645
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:56,330
and he finds her actually still alive
with the life about to run out of her, uh,

646
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:59,600
harbor. It's unknown what happens
for the rest of that evening,

647
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:03,360
but it is a well-documented fact that
the very next morning on schedule,

648
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:06,520
he goes back to the, to the front,
to the eastern front. Leaving. Yeah.

649
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,570
His son, uh,

650
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:14,030
alone with his dead mother. That's

651
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:20,040
cold, Huh? Yeah. Heartless
ed was a terrible moment.

652
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:24,080
Did he run away? Was it duty? The sign?

653
00:39:24,081 --> 00:39:26,780
Eventually after he immigrates to America,

654
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,070
[inaudible] kills himself.

655
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:42,860
[inaudible]

656
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,790
see now around this point,

657
00:39:43,791 --> 00:39:46,480
I just don't want to have anything
to do with this guy. This is a,

658
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:49,130
I just want to take a
shower. Walk away. Yeah.

659
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:50,623
Yeah, me too.

660
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:56,460
You know, on the other hand, I mean, if
you look at the grand calculus people,

661
00:39:56,461 --> 00:39:58,830
he's helped or fed versus
people he's killed. I mean,

662
00:39:58,831 --> 00:40:00,420
he's felt that billions of people.

663
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,210
I don't know that you could
entirely call him bad.

664
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:08,270
I might even tilt towards saying
he's a little good to be honest.

665
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:09,510
You wouldn't though, would you really?

666
00:40:09,511 --> 00:40:12,690
Would you really think that this
guy's a good guy? Honestly, yeah.

667
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:17,460
Just because of a mathematical summing
up. We're talking billions of people.

668
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:22,470
He's standing there on the front pushing
the gas into the lungs or other human

669
00:40:22,471 --> 00:40:26,370
beings. It's merely, it's a war, but
still, then he goes and you know,

670
00:40:26,371 --> 00:40:30,720
and celebrates that and then walks away
from his child and his wife did in the

671
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:33,000
garden and says more of that please. Well,

672
00:40:33,001 --> 00:40:36,660
there's something distasteful about
the fact that he was too into it.

673
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,320
But like I do think on some level you
have to divorce the man from his deeds and

674
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:42,990
you've got to ask, is the world
better with him or without him?

675
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,740
I think you've got to
answer it with him. Right.

676
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,720
Well, to keep going with
the story. Yeah. Alright.

677
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,390
So Sam, what happened to
this guy after World War One?

678
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:03,520
He actually was very humiliated that
Germany had lost and especially humiliated

679
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
over the fact that they
had to pay enormous war
reparations to other countries.

680
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:16,090
So he decided he was going to invent a
process to pay for these reparations by

681
00:41:16,761 --> 00:41:21,080
himself. And what he decided
to do is go into the ocean,

682
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:25,110
into sea water, which contains, um, uh,

683
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,980
very small levels of gold. But you know,

684
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:32,960
over the entire ocean there's a
lot of gold dissolved into the sea.

685
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,100
And he spent five years

686
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,790
in a few tile effort to distill
gold from the ocean's waters.

687
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,430
Sounds insane. On the other
hand, if anyone could do it,

688
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,330
he was trying to repeat this master
stroke. Needless to say, he fails.

689
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,430
It was actually a crushing
blow for, for him.

690
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,440
And then things really take a turn.

691
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,310
1933 comes and Hitler takes over.

692
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:59,640
And one of the first acts that the Nazis
do is to basically issue an order that

693
00:42:01,121 --> 00:42:05,470
says there shall be no Jews in the
civil service. Now harbor was Jewish,

694
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:09,580
but because he'd served in World War
One, he technically would be exempt.

695
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:12,460
But 75% of the people who
worked for him at the institute,

696
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:15,850
they were Jewish and they
would have to be dismissed.

697
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:20,530
So he decides to take a stand
and says, this is intolerable.

698
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,630
I'm going to resign. He says that he's a,

699
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,320
he's always been hiring people based
on how smart they are and not who their

700
00:42:26,321 --> 00:42:30,580
grandparents were. So he sends a letter
to the Ministry of Education, resigning,

701
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:35,950
and he leaves Germany telling a friend.
He felt like he'd lost his homeland.

702
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,390
And then he starts this
a period of roaming.

703
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:43,270
He eventually goes to England.
But in a famous incident,

704
00:42:43,271 --> 00:42:46,960
one of England's leading scientists
refuses to shake his hand.

705
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:51,840
And he is basically homeless
at this point. You know,

706
00:42:51,841 --> 00:42:55,500
he's a man adrift. Meanwhile,
his health is failing.

707
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:59,940
In 1934 he takes a trip to
Switzerland, to a sanatorium,

708
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:04,140
but before he can get there,
his heart fails and he dies.

709
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:06,410
Mm.

710
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:10,490
Now there's a footnote to
this that is very strange.

711
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:15,170
Um, I got a little, uh, my, I,

712
00:43:15,171 --> 00:43:18,710
this is my dorsal hairs stood up
when I read the end of this. Right.

713
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:20,390
So during World War One,

714
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:25,310
harbor's institute had
developed a formulation of, um,

715
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:29,690
insect killing gas called Zyklon Zyklon a,

716
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,930
which was originally just a pesticide.
Once again, another nitrogen compound.

717
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,860
It was developed in his institute.
He knew about it. In fact,

718
00:43:36,861 --> 00:43:39,950
his chemist had given this
particular pesticide, a smell was,

719
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:43,850
it was a warning smell so that people
didn't inadvertently breathe it in and get

720
00:43:43,851 --> 00:43:47,000
sick. But after the Nazis take
over, this is after he died,

721
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:52,210
they reached back to the shelf and they
find this xy clon stuff and they asked

722
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:58,931
for it to be reformulated to take out the
warning smell and it becomes Zyklon B,

723
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:02,390
the killing gas of the
concentration camps.

724
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,160
[inaudible]

725
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,640
did members of Hubbard's family die
in the concentration camps? Yeah.

726
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:12,800
Members of his extended family did.

727
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:16,670
Certainly friends of his
did is something deeply,

728
00:44:16,671 --> 00:44:20,570
deeply wounding, stressing,

729
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:25,660
upsetting at the thought that he
had anything to do with sibling B.

730
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:30,390
But he did the use of it.
He couldn't have imagined

731
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:55,320
[inaudible]

732
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:59,670
so how do you feel about him
now? Because I don't know.

733
00:44:59,671 --> 00:45:02,820
I can't help but feel bad for
the guy despite the chlorine gas.

734
00:45:02,821 --> 00:45:07,050
Like he didn't intend for that to happen.
He could have never imagined that. No,

735
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,080
but, but there's part of
me that says, you know,

736
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:14,400
here's a guy who just wanted
to do everything better
than he had ever been done

737
00:45:14,401 --> 00:45:18,960
before. Whether it was feeding
or killing or any does. He does,

738
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:24,430
but he does it with a kind of
amoral athleticism. You know, he,

739
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:29,210
he does it without humility, without,
without a lot of doubt. And you know,

740
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,083
it's a craft,

741
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:34,590
but it's a craft with consequences and
to approach it with kind of crazy joy.

742
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:36,630
I don't know.

743
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:41,250
I would rather have scientists who
carry doubt with them as they proceed.

744
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:45,210
Yeah, I agree with that. Maybe
it's all about doubt in the end.

745
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:55,820

Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich,

755
00:46:32,901 --> 00:46:35,030
Radiolab and today we're
talking about, well,

756
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:39,080
we're trying to think about what
goes on in the mind of a bad person.

757
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:43,460
What makes a bad person so bad that he's
different from the rest of us and we

758
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:45,840
don't really come to any kind of
agreement with the hopper thing. Yeah,

759
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:48,280
I don't think we quite know, but you know,

760
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:51,950
we ended up walking this question around
different people want to talk about bad

761
00:46:51,951 --> 00:46:53,980
people in Shakespeare.
And oddly enough, we came,

762
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:57,860
got a really interesting take on the true
nature of badness from this Guy James

763
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,820
Shapiro,

764
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:03,110
professor of English at Columbia
University and he said to start,

765
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:06,770
you want to know about bad? I'll
give you bet in Titus Andronicus,

766
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,940
there's a character by the
name of Aaron, the Moore,

767
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:11,330
and there's a moment in the play
where Aaron gets up on stage,

768
00:47:11,331 --> 00:47:12,410
looks at the audience and says,

769
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:16,010
let me just tell you the kinds of
things I've been up to recently,

770
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:21,340
said deadly enmity between two
friends make poor men's cattle,

771
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,190
break their necks, set fire on bonds,

772
00:47:24,191 --> 00:47:27,260
and he stacks in the night
and bid the owners questions,

773
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:29,350
quenched him with the tears off.

774
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:34,410
Have I digged up dead men from their
graves and sit them upright of their dear

775
00:47:34,631 --> 00:47:36,940
friends door? Oh,

776
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:40,300
even even with this sorrows
almost were forgotten.

777
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:45,490
And on their skins is on the bark of
trees have wind my life with my knife

778
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:47,290
carved in Roman letters.

779
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:52,120
Let not your sorrows die though I am dead.

780
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:58,150
So he's bad. Yeah, but see, here's the
interesting thing. According to James,

781
00:47:58,151 --> 00:48:03,151
he's not the baddest no in Shakespeare
or in life because ultimately the play

782
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,800
offers up a reason for his nastiness.

783
00:48:05,801 --> 00:48:09,550
The reason why he's telling all this
stuff is because he has cut a deal.

784
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,760
They will spare his son if he fastest
up and and tells them what they need to

785
00:48:16,121 --> 00:48:19,630
know. So there's a way in which
is a touch of spark of humanity,

786
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:22,660
just a little glimmer. And he
says that's what people wanted.

787
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:28,110
They wanted someone who was
really thrillingly bad but
in the end was a redeemed

788
00:48:28,271 --> 00:48:30,570
a bit. Yeah. This wasn't
just a theater thing. No.

789
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,530
Cause if you couldn't afford
a ticket for a player,

790
00:48:32,531 --> 00:48:36,400
you'd seen all the plays in the 1500 you
could always go to a public hanging and

791
00:48:36,401 --> 00:48:40,480
you'd go for much the same reasons. And
those days if you're a convicted felon,

792
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:45,370
you are, you know, strung up, but you're
not allowed to hang until you die.

793
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:48,880
You're cut down before then warning,
this next part's a little graphic.

794
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:52,000
Then the executioner cast rates,

795
00:48:52,001 --> 00:48:56,830
you cuts you open and takes out your
internal organs and then separate your

796
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:00,640
head, which is put on a post. But even
with all that Gore and horribleness,

797
00:49:00,641 --> 00:49:03,550
there was often a moment
that people waited for.

798
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,680
And in a way we wait
for it still. Even now,

799
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:08,920
we want what Alyssa beef
and Scott at the scaffold,

800
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:13,990
which was a confession before
the guy is cut to shreds.

801
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:17,650
He's allowed to confess. You
know, I, I hardly, you know,

802
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:22,270
regret the fact that I, uh, kill
the young Baden or defame the king,

803
00:49:22,271 --> 00:49:22,990
whatever it is.

804
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:27,990
The expectation is somebody is made to
make his peace with his maker before he

805
00:49:28,901 --> 00:49:33,580
dies. That's what you do. And that's
what Shakespeare did. And all his plays,

806
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:38,080
he would give all his baddies at least
one moment where they could be understood

807
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:41,260
except this one time.

808
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,260
So be like a two

809
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:49,760
in tough. He is a soldier.

810
00:49:49,761 --> 00:49:54,290
He works for a general, the general's
name is a fellow there supposedly chums,

811
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:57,760
but General Othello has
no idea that he Jago

812
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:02,040
hates him.

813
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:07,820
So he plans to destroy a fellow
and then we don't exactly know why.

814
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:11,870
There are hints of reasons like maybe he
thinks a fellow sleeping with his wife,

815
00:50:11,871 --> 00:50:12,704
we're not sure.

816
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,640
But the weird thing is that he decides
not just to take down the fellow,

817
00:50:16,641 --> 00:50:19,220
but everybody, no, no, no. What you did,

818
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:24,680
he stirs up hatred
between friends, friends

819
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,770
between lovers. He even
schemes against his wife.

820
00:50:27,771 --> 00:50:32,771
This is just somebody who's performing
brain surgery without anesthesia on other

821
00:50:34,101 --> 00:50:38,480
people. Uh, he's a master planner.

822
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:44,020
And as for why maybe a fellow
was sleeping with Amelia.

823
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:49,060
But as the play goes on, you begin to
think that maybe that's just another lie.

824
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,600
Eventually Iago convinces a fellow
that his wife has been disloyal,

825
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:56,730
which she hasn't. And then Othello
goes and kills his own wife,

826
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:00,300
smothering her with a pillow.

827
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:05,330
This is just at tsunami of
Eva passes through the plant.

828
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:10,560
[inaudible] is good. And at
the very end of the play,

829
00:51:10,561 --> 00:51:14,520
when everyone finds out what y'all
goes done, fellow asks him, why,

830
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,290
why did you do this?

831
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:21,630
Any Jago he refuses what

832
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:28,720
we fully expect and what everybody on
stage at that moment fully expects from

833
00:51:30,741 --> 00:51:34,850
him. You know, what does he say? Um,

834
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:39,770
demand mean nothing. What you know,

835
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:46,360
no, from this time forth,

836
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:49,360
I never will speak word.

837
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:55,670
I'm not saying a word. I'm not
going to give you what you want.

838
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,840
I'm not going to give you,

839
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:01,550
I'm not going to help restore the sense
that there is a moral order to the

840
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:03,400
world. And a moral norm.

841
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:05,940
[inaudible]

842
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:08,340
what you know, you know,

843
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,690
if this is the singular moment in
Shakespeare where he gives you an

844
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:19,430
understandably evil man.
No Motors, no reason.

845
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:21,710
Hello.

846
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:23,860
Any idea what the hell he was intending?

847
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:27,830
What's she know, you know

848
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:35,490
of it? Meaning, I mean w any
idea where he was in his mind?

849
00:52:35,491 --> 00:52:37,830
Was he trying to make a commentary? So
there was he grappling with something?

850
00:52:37,831 --> 00:52:41,530
Do we know? No, you know, dammit

851
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:48,100
the goody Algos make you want to shower
the minute you leave the theater cause

852
00:52:48,101 --> 00:52:50,020
you are Sally by them.

853
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:54,590
Thank you to James Shapiro who his most
recent book is called contested. Will.

854
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,920
You know what you, unless
you have you there. Yeah.

855
00:52:57,921 --> 00:53:00,920
Well you know what I'm left thinking
though. He's like, if you could somehow,

856
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:01,940
I mean that was make-believe,

857
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:05,870
but if you could somehow get a real Jago
in the room and subject that person to

858
00:53:05,871 --> 00:53:09,560
questioning and really get them to
sort of fess up as to why they did it,

859
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,100
would that make a difference?

860
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:14,950
We should say that this next section of
the program has some references which

861
00:53:14,951 --> 00:53:18,400
are extremely graphic. Yeah. Not to
everybody's taste. So we have kids in the,

862
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:22,090
in the room and maybe this is at a time
they tell them to go brush their teeth

863
00:53:22,091 --> 00:53:25,830
or something. Yeah, yeah. It comes to
us from our reporter parenting. Scott

864
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:31,130
is Jeff Johnson. Nice to meet you. All
right, so who is this guy? We're here.

865
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:36,430
This is Jeff Jensen and he's a reporter
in La and he wrote this graphic novel

866
00:53:36,471 --> 00:53:40,820
that I read about one of the most
prolific serial killers in u s history.

867
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,020
Gary Leon Ridgway, the green river killer.

868
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:47,890
The first victims of the
green river killer were found
in the summer of 1982 the

869
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:52,130
green river murders terrorized
Seattle in the 1980s in Seattle today,

870
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:56,140
a man called the green river killer.
Ridgeway murdered at least 49 women,

871
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:57,640
so called Green River killer.

872
00:53:57,850 --> 00:54:02,850
It's suspected that it could be upwards
of 75 making him the most prolific

873
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:06,850
serial killer in American history.
All the victims were prostitutes.

874
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:11,710
He buried them or left their bodies
in these little clumps in the woods.

875
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:14,260
The kind of seemed to a place to
bodies as if they were mannequins.

876
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,110
And in January of 1984,

877
00:54:17,111 --> 00:54:20,800
the green river task force was formed
and my father was recruited at the task

878
00:54:20,801 --> 00:54:24,130
force. So Jeff wrote this book
because his father, Tom Jensen,

879
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,280
was one of the lead
detectives tracking Gary Way.

880
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:32,190
He ultimately spent 17 years searching
for this man. In December of 2001,

881
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:36,960
my father and his colleagues make the
arrest DNA testing matched him to the

882
00:54:36,961 --> 00:54:40,290
crime they arrest Gary
League, Leon Ridgway. And on

883
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:42,300
June 13th, 2003,

884
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:47,300
Gary was secretly taken out of his
jail cell and brought to a sort of very

885
00:54:47,671 --> 00:54:50,670
nondescript concrete,

886
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:55,800
ugly office building. And
um, over the next six months,

887
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:58,800
from June to early December,

888
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:03,510
it was Tom's job to get Gary to open up
and give up the few details that they

889
00:55:03,511 --> 00:55:06,690
really needed to link him
certifiably to all these crimes.

890
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,870
Today's date is June 17th, 2003,

891
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:15,080
at the time now is zero eight 36 hours.

892
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:19,640
So every day they would bring them into
this conference room is a continuation

893
00:55:19,641 --> 00:55:22,970
of an interview with Gary Leon
Ridgway and interrogate them.

894
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:26,430
What did you remember
since we last talked? You

895
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:32,700
got those all attuned mostly. Um,

896
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:35,530
some that, uh,

897
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:39,200
I remember picking her up and um,

898
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:43,770
it immediately became apparent that there
was going to be difficulties as far as

899
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,910
I know. I don't know if I
did or not. You would deny

900
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:47,190
things. He would obscure,

901
00:55:47,191 --> 00:55:50,430
he would dance around things
you didn't really want a cop to.

902
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,750
Everything that he did.

903
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,730
Did I gotta Tell Ya? Uh, I mean,

904
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:58,390
not totally comfortable that you're
providing all the information,

905
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:02,160
especially when it came
to one particular fact.

906
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:07,220
What my father and his colleagues know
is that something was done to these body,

907
00:56:07,231 --> 00:56:10,590
many of them after they
were murdered. Does he,

908
00:56:10,591 --> 00:56:11,820
is he saying what I think he's saying?

909
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:16,770
Necrophilia Gary is
dancing around this topic.

910
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,790
Gary had denied this to his own lawyers
and that we're not going to be shot.

911
00:56:20,791 --> 00:56:24,940
So my father and the other interviewer
in that room, that morning,

912
00:56:24,941 --> 00:56:29,800
detective John Madson,
they start using a line of,

913
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:33,170
uh, attacked of, uh, of
interviewing him. That was very,

914
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:37,260
it's okay. It's okay
if you did. Stunningly,

915
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:40,320
shockingly empathetic,
nothing to be ashamed.

916
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:44,910
Thousands of people have done it
before. You know, I'm not the first one.

917
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,030
You know, you're not the first
person that's ever done this,

918
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:51,690
not going to be the last
one. You won't be the last.

919
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:55,200
That's one of the things that we really
need to know if father's trying to like

920
00:56:55,201 --> 00:56:58,650
reach out to him. Okay. I know
it was more than marriage.

921
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:02,700
It's okay to admit this. You need
to admit this. Okay. It's all right.

922
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:04,590
We've got to note that.

923
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:08,760
That's one of the things that you have
to know and that's why it's okay to let

924
00:57:08,761 --> 00:57:13,110
him know and he does a yes,

925
00:57:13,111 --> 00:57:17,530
I did lie about that. Potential is a,

926
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:22,320
I would bet one time before that I,

927
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,270
like I said, I've got to give it out.

928
00:57:27,271 --> 00:57:29,850
It can't keep holding
and holding it numbers,

929
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:30,760
building up.

930
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:35,760
This was a major breakthrough so he ends
up admitting it in graphic detail and

931
00:57:36,101 --> 00:57:40,360
it gets even more disturbing for my
father as the conversation suddenly pivots

932
00:57:40,361 --> 00:57:41,920
to another victim

933
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,000
other than one

934
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:49,460
that was real close to me by the name
of Carol Christian said Christian.

935
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:52,630
I dated her several times,
three times, two times.

936
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:57,550
He brings her up as an example of a
of a woman that he actually had strong

937
00:57:57,551 --> 00:57:58,750
feelings for

938
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:02,820
like just like just girl
lecturers. She was skinny,

939
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:04,143
she was good to me

940
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:08,760
and as it happens my father has very
vivid memories of investigating the Carol

941
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,780
Christianson murder. Speaking with
Carol's mom, Carol's little daughter

942
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,430
killed her. She was, I
knew she had a daughter.

943
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:18,840
And so your last,

944
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:23,330
Gary's starts going through this
narrative of what he did to Carol

945
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:28,350
the last time she was in our hurry.

946
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:32,560
She like was allegedly in a rush
and she didn't and like it kind of

947
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,500
[inaudible] hurt his feelings

948
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:38,950
wasn't satisfying me with make me
mad because she very much hurry.

949
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:43,770
She doesn't melt in her mind, and I

950
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:50,410
killed her killer at shelter with my arm
and weight killer cared for because I

951
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:59,500
dated before, but this
tape didn't turn out right

952
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:01,370
up until that point.

953
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:05,270
Gary refused to say that from the
minute I picked these women up,

954
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:09,140
I wanted to kill them. He claimed
they were in the middle of a sex act.

955
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:12,710
He would get distracted, something would
happen. He just kind of went crazy.

956
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:17,860
He had snapped and almost like blaming
the victims and my father wasn't buying

957
00:59:19,581 --> 00:59:22,160
it. Let's hold back up
a little bit. The fact

958
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,400
that he kept on doing it over and over
and over again, it was like, come on.

959
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:29,400
You've been through this a lot of times
before and she's already told you she's

960
00:59:29,401 --> 00:59:32,490
in a hurry. You knew what was going
to happen and you've done this.

961
00:59:32,491 --> 00:59:35,850
How many times? 10 Times,

962
00:59:35,851 --> 00:59:37,710
10 1520 times.

963
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:43,250
You know what's going to happen is she
pisses you off and you like telling this

964
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,633
all,

965
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:50,710
get you go into this knowing full
well that it could end up in her dash

966
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:56,820
and Gary just says, yes. That
is true. When I picked him up,

967
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:02,430
I was going to kill them. Finally
acknowledging. Yeah, that's true.

968
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:08,420
There's a pause and my
father just says, why? Why?

969
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:14,180
Why did you do this? You need the killed.

970
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,900
And that was a question that had
haunted my father for decades.

971
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,830
Why isn't that why and that one
simple why that he asks Gary,

972
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,140
there was a lot of
questions. He was asking,

973
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:28,040
why did you inflict all this
suffering on them? On us?

974
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:31,580
Why did you take these women off the
streets and wanting to destroy them? Why?

975
01:00:31,581 --> 01:00:32,414
Why?

976
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:41,560
The answer is

977
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:46,880
unsatisfying. Yes. I did need to kill,

978
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:49,600
kill her because,

979
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,233
wait, what?

980
01:00:56,340 --> 01:01:01,340
I just needed to kill because of
that and then he just trails off.

981
01:01:01,531 --> 01:01:05,550
I need to kill because of that.
That's it. It just, you know,

982
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:08,130
I just wanted to kill him.
I just needed to kill them

983
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:16,790
in that moment. My father, he
stands up. Then he says, touch me.

984
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:22,270
You've touched me, Gary, you
touched me. You take a break.

985
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:24,340
Okay, we're going off tape now.

986
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:29,710
Is there a nine 24
hours on June 17th year,

987
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:34,290
2004 he walked out of the way a
room and just started weeping.

988
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:39,870
They spent the next six
months interrogating him.

989
01:01:39,871 --> 01:01:43,830
They brought in psychiatrists and
forensic psychologists to try to get an

990
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,400
answer. Gary says, I needed to kill
him. They go, why? And he says,

991
01:01:47,401 --> 01:01:49,440
because of the rage
and well, why the rage?

992
01:01:49,441 --> 01:01:51,840
And because women have stepped
on me all my life. Well,

993
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:54,090
why can't you deal with
it in a normal way?

994
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:59,050
Each answer just begs another why and
even though in the end they got him to

995
01:01:59,051 --> 01:02:01,270
confess to these 49 murders,

996
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:06,250
they never really get any closer
to an answer than this first one.

997
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:09,570
[inaudible]

998
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:12,720
that afternoon he gets
in his car, goes home,

999
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:17,760
he finds my mom on the deck,
he sits down next to her

1000
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:18,700
[inaudible]

1001
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:22,500
she says, what happened
today? My Dad said,

1002
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:23,940
I don't want to talk about it.

1003
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:29,370
And to this day they have not talked
about that day and he hasn't talked about

1004
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:33,330
it with anyone until I
interviewed him for the book.

1005
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:36,053
And

1006
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:40,620
why is it so important do you think,

1007
01:02:40,621 --> 01:02:44,700
to understand the why
behind such an evil act?

1008
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:45,870
Well,

1009
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:48,900
the thing that haunts me about the why
question is that I'm reminded of like one

1010
01:02:48,901 --> 01:02:51,540
of the oldest stories in the
Bible, which is the story of job.

1011
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:56,860
The story of job is that one day God
and Satan are having a conversation and

1012
01:02:56,940 --> 01:03:01,470
they're saying, have you checked out
job? You know, I'm really proud of job.

1013
01:03:01,471 --> 01:03:06,471
He believes in me and he trusts me so
much and he has such great faith in me and

1014
01:03:07,111 --> 01:03:09,960
Satan is like, ah, I bet
I can change his mind.

1015
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:14,730
And so Satan basically
systematically destroys job's life,

1016
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:18,060
takes away his wife, his children,
all his material possessions.

1017
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:22,980
What follows is this ongoing conversation
between Jobe and his friends about why

1018
01:03:22,981 --> 01:03:26,760
does this happen? Why does
God allow this to happen?

1019
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:31,320
Only then does God speak
up and kind of say like,

1020
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:34,950
you're going to question me
like, you know who are you?

1021
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:41,630
My point is sometimes when we ask
the why in the face of profound evil,

1022
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:47,430
I kind of wonder if what we're doing is
that we're daring God to show himself

1023
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:53,040
and I think what we want out of
the y is meaning meaning to life,

1024
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:58,041
to reveal itself in a way that restores
order and gives us hope that all of this

1025
01:03:59,881 --> 01:04:01,680
isn't just meaningless chaos.

1026
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:29,720
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

1027
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:02,660
Jensen's book is the Green River
Killer, a true detective story.

1028
01:05:02,661 --> 01:05:05,870
It's a graphic or an
illustrated novel. Thanks.

1029
01:05:05,871 --> 01:05:09,920
Also to reporter Aaron Scott for
that story. This is Radiolab.

1030
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:10,970
Thanks for listening.
