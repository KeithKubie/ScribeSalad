00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.790
My name is Steve Pinker, and I’m Professor
of Psychology at Harvard University. &nbsp;And

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.680
today I’m going to speak to you about language.
&nbsp;﻿I’m actually not a linguist, but a

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.160
cognitive scientist. &nbsp;I’m not so much interested
as language as an object in its own right,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.490
but as a window to the human mind.﻿
Language is one of the fundamental topics

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.030
in the human sciences. &nbsp;It’s the trait
that most conspicuously distinguishes humans

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:45.030
from other species, it’s essential to human
cooperation; we accomplish amazing things

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.239
by sharing our knowledge or coordinating our
actions by means of words. &nbsp;It poses profound

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.770
scientific mysteries such as, how did language
evolve in this particular species? &nbsp;How does

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.610
the brain compute language? But also, language
has many practical applications not surprisingly

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.020
given how central it is to human life. ﻿
Language comes so naturally to us that we’re

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.420
apt to forget what a strange and miraculous
gift it is. &nbsp;But think about what you’re

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.100
doing for the next hour. &nbsp;&nbsp;You’re going
to be listening patiently as a guy makes noise

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.500
as he exhales. &nbsp;Now, why would you do something
like that? &nbsp;It’s not that I can claim that

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.750
the sounds I’m going to make are particularly
mellifluous, but rather I’ve coded information

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.330
into the exact sequences of hisses and hums
and squeaks and pops that I’ll be making.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.720
&nbsp;You have the ability to recover the information
from that stream of noises allowing us to

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.619
share ideas.
Now, the ideas we are going to share are about

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.330
this talent, language, but with a slightly
different sequence of hisses and squeaks,

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.079
I could cause you to be thinking thoughts
about a vast array of topics, anything from

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.900
the latest developments in your favorite reality
show to theories of the origin of the universe.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.760
&nbsp;This is what I think of as the miracle of
language, its vast expressive power, and it’s

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.440
a phenomenon that still fills me with wonder,
even after having studied language for 35

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:31.540
years. &nbsp;And it is the prime phenomenon that
the science of language aims to explain. &nbsp;﻿

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.410
Not surprisingly, language is central to human
life. &nbsp;The Biblical story of the Tower of

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.760
Babel reminds us that humans accomplish great
things because they can exchange information

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.209
about their knowledge and intentions via the
medium of language. &nbsp;Language, moreover,

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:53.340
is not a peculiarity of one culture, but it
has been found in every society ever studied

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.640
by anthropologists.﻿
There’s some 6,000 languages spoken on Earth,

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:05.320
all of them complex, and no one has ever discovered
a human society that lacks complex language.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.569
&nbsp;For this and other reasons, Charles Darwin
wrote, “Man has an instinctive tendency

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:16.620
to speak as we see in the babble of our young
children while no child has an instinctive

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.020
tendency to bake, brew or write.” ﻿

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.489
Language is an intricate talent and it’s
not surprising that the science of language

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.489
should be a complex discipline.
﻿It includes the study of how language itself

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:38.090
works including: &nbsp;grammar, the assembly of
words, phrases and sentences; phonology, the

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:45.129
study of sound; semantics, the study of meaning;
and pragmatics, the study of the use of language

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.180
in conversation. ﻿
﻿Scientists interested in language also

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.990
study how it is processed in real time, a
field called psycholinguistics; how is it

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.540
acquired by children, the study of language
acquisition. &nbsp;And how it is computed in the

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.220
brain, the discipline called neurolinguistics.
﻿ 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:11.590
Now, before we begin, it’s important to
not to confuse language with three other things

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:18.250
that are closely related to language. &nbsp;One
of them is written language. &nbsp;Unlike spoken

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.520
language, which is found in all human cultures
throughout history, writing was invented a

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.500
very small number of times in human history,
about 5,000 years ago. &nbsp;﻿

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:35.470
And alphabetic writing where each mark on
the page stands for a vowel or a consonant,

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.220
appears to have been invented only once in
all of human history by the Canaanites about

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:47.800
3,700 years ago. &nbsp;And as Darwin pointed out,
children have no instinctive tendency to write,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.850
but have to learn it through construction
and schooling.﻿

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:58.061
A second thing not to confuse language with
is proper grammar. &nbsp;Linguists distinguish

00:04:58.061 --> 00:05:05.140
between descriptive grammar - the rules, that
characterize how people to speak - and prescriptive

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.260
grammar - rules that characterize how people
ought to speak if they are writing careful

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.690
written prose. &nbsp;﻿
A dirty secret from linguistics is that not

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:22.240
only are these not the same kinds of rules,
but many of the prescriptive rules of language

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.640
make no sense whatsoever. &nbsp;Take one of the
most famous of these rules, the rule not to

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.540
split infinitives. &nbsp;﻿
According to this rule, Captain Kirk made

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.930
a grievous grammatical error when he said
that the mission of the Enterprise was “to

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.990
boldly go where no man has gone before.”
&nbsp;He should have said, according to these

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:48.800
editors, “to go boldly where no man has
gone before,” which immediately clashes

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.910
with the rhythm and structure of ordinary
English. &nbsp;In fact, this prescriptive rule

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:00.660
was based on a clumsy analogy with Latin where
you can’t splint an infinitive because it’s

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.910
a single word, as in facary[ph] to do. &nbsp;Julius
Caesar couldn’t have split an infinitive

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:12.940
if he wanted to. &nbsp;That rule was translated
literally over into English where it really

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.260
should not apply. &nbsp;﻿
Another famous prescriptive rule is that,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:23.140
one should never use a so-called double negative.
&nbsp;Mick Jagger should not have sung, “I can’t

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.640
get no satisfaction,” he really should have
sung, “I can’t get any satisfaction.”

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:34.680
&nbsp;Now, this is often promoted as a rule of
logical speaking, but “can’t” and “any”

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.420
is just as much of a double negative as “can’t”
and “no.” &nbsp;The only reason that “can’t

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.600
get any satisfaction” is deemed correct
and “can’t get no satisfaction” is deemed

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:50.140
ungrammatical is that the dialect of English
spoken in the south of England in the 17th

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.730
century used “can’t” “any” rather
than “can’t” “no.” &nbsp;﻿

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.070
If the capital of England had been in the
north of the country instead of the south

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.401
of the country, then “can’t get no,”
would have been correct and “can’t get

00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:03.330
any,” would have been deemed incorrect.
﻿

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:08.410
There’s nothing special about a language
that happens to be chosen as the standard

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:14.890
for a given country. &nbsp;In fact, if you compare
the rules of languages and so-called dialects,

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:20.910
each one is complex in different ways. &nbsp;Take
for example, African-American vernacular English,

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:27.540
also called Black English or Ebonics. &nbsp;There
is a construction in African-American where

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:33.460
you can say, “He be workin,” which is
not an error or bastardization or a corruption

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:38.670
of Standard English, but in fact conveys a
subtle distinction, one that’s different

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:45.680
than simply, “He workin.” &nbsp;“He be workin,”
means that he is employed; he has a job, “He

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:51.180
workin,” means that he happens to be working
at the moment that you and I are speaking.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.320
&nbsp;﻿
Now, this is a tense difference that can be

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:59.480
made in African-American English that is not
made in Standard English, one of many examples

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:05.620
in which the dialects have their own set of
rules that is just as sophisticated and complex

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:10.710
as the one in the standard language. &nbsp;﻿
Now, a third thing, not to confuse language

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:17.210
with is thought. &nbsp;Many people report that
they think in language, but commune of psychologists

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:23.220
have shown that there are many kinds of thought
that don’t actually take place in the form

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.220
of sentences. &nbsp;﻿

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.670
(1.) Babies (and other mammals) communicate
without speech

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:31.980
﻿For example, we know from ingenious experiments
that non-linguistic creatures, such as babies

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:38.720
before they’ve learned to speak, or other
kinds of animals, have sophisticated kinds

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:45.430
of cognition, they register cause and effect
and objects and the intentions of other people,

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.280
all without the benefit of speech. &nbsp;﻿
(2.) Types of thinking go on without language--visual

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.340
thinking﻿
We also know that even in creatures that do

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:56.860
have language, namely adults, a lot of thinking
goes on in forms other than language, for

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:03.190
example, visual imagery. &nbsp;If you look at
the top two three-dimensional figures in this

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:09.110
display, and I would ask you, do they have
the same shape or a different shape? &nbsp;People

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:15.190
don’t solve that problem by describing those
strings of cubes in words, but rather by taking

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:21.630
an image of one and mentally rotating it into
the orientation of the other, a form of non-linguistic

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.630
thinking. &nbsp;﻿
(3.) We use tacit knowledge to understand

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:25.310
language and remember the gist﻿
For that matter, even when you understand

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:31.160
language, what you come away with is not in
itself the actual language that you hear.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:37.770
&nbsp;Another important finding in cognitive psychology
is that long-term memory for verbal material

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:44.870
records the gist or the meaning or the content
of the words rather than the exact form of

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:48.500
the words. &nbsp;﻿
For example, I like to think that you retain

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:53.940
some memory of what I have been saying for
the last 10 minutes. &nbsp;But I suspect that

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:59.770
if I were to ask you to reproduce any sentence
that I have uttered, you would be incapable

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:07.130
of doing so. &nbsp;What sticks in memory is far
more abstract than the actual sentences, something

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:11.790
that we can call meaning or content or semantics.
&nbsp;﻿

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:17.990
In fact, when it even comes to &nbsp;&nbsp;understanding
a sentence, the actual words are the tip of

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:25.150
a vast iceberg of a very rapid, unconscious,
non-linguistic processing that’s necessary

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:30.180
even to make sense of the language itself.
&nbsp;And I’ll illustrate this with a classic

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:37.130
bit of poetry, the lines from the shampoo
bottle. &nbsp;“Wet hair, lather, rinse, repeat.”

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.820
&nbsp;﻿
Now, in understanding that very simple snatch

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:44.610
of language, you have to know, for example,
that when you repeat, you don’t wet your

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:49.070
hair a second time because its already wet,
and when you get to the end of it and you

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:53.880
see “repeat,” you don’t keep repeating
over and over in infinite loop, repeat here

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:59.970
means, “repeat just once.” &nbsp;Now this
tacit knowledge of what the writers **** of

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:06.400
language had in mind is necessary to understand
language, but it, itself, is not language.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.860
﻿
(4.) If language is thinking, then where did

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.710
it come from?﻿
Finally, if language were really thought,

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:15.320
it would raise the question of where language
would come from if it were incapable of thinking

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:20.550
without language. &nbsp;After all, the English
language was not designed by some committee

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:26.600
of Martians who came down to Earth and gave
it to us. &nbsp;Rather, language is a grassroots

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:33.320
phenomenon. &nbsp;It’s the original wiki, which
aggregates the contributions of hundreds of

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:39.710
thousands of people who invent jargon and
slang and new constructions, some of them

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:46.180
get accumulated into the language as people
seek out new ways of expressing their thoughts,

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:51.070
and that’s how we get a language in the
first place. &nbsp;﻿

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:59.160
Now, this not to deny that language can affect
thought and linguistics has long been interested

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:05.670
in what has sometimes been called, the linguistic
relativity hypothesis or the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:09.540
(note correct spelling, named after the two
linguists who first formulated it, namely

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:15.430
that language can affect thought. &nbsp;There’s
a lot of controversy over the status of the

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:20.810
linguistic relativity hypothesis, but no one
believes that language is the same thing as

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:26.600
thought and that all of our mental life consists
of reciting sentences. &nbsp;﻿

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:32.610
Now that we have set aside what language is
not, let’s turn to what language is beginning

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:39.280
with the question of how language works.
In a nutshell, you can divide language into

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:46.040
three topics. &nbsp;﻿
There are the words that are the basic components

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.230
of sentences that are stored in a part of
long-term memory that we can call the mental

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:57.480
lexicon or the mental dictionary. &nbsp;There
are rules, the recipes or algorithms that

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:05.220
we use to assemble bits of language into more
complex stretches of language including syntax,

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:11.130
the rules that allow us to assemble words
into phrases and sentences; Morphology, the

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:17.320
rules that allow us to assemble bits of words,
like prefixes and suffixes into complex words;

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:24.290
Phonology, the rules that allow us to combine
vowels and consonants into the smallest words.

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:30.670
&nbsp;And then all of this knowledge of language
has to connect to the world through interfaces

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:36.070
that allow us to understand language coming
from others to produce language that others

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.650
can understand us, the language interfaces.﻿

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:45.420
Let’s start with words.﻿
The basic principle of a word was identified

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:51.840
by the Swiss linguist, Ferdinand de Saussure,
more than 100 years ago when he called attention

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:57.550
to the arbitrariness of the sign. &nbsp;Take for
example the word, “duck.” &nbsp;The word,

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:02.650
“duck” doesn’t look like a duck or walk
like a duck or quack like a duck, but I can

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:07.240
use it to get you to think the thought of
a duck because all of us at some point in

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:14.610
our lives have memorized that brute force
association between that sound and that meaning,

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:19.580
which means that it has to be stored in memory
in some format, in a very simplified form

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:24.460
and an entry in the mental lexicon might look
something like this. &nbsp;There is a symbol for

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:31.670
the word itself, there is some kind of specification
of its sound and there’s some kind of specification

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:36.600
of its meaning. &nbsp;﻿
Now, one of the remarkable facts about the

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:43.800
mental lexicon is how capacious it is. &nbsp;Using
dictionary sampling techniques where you say,

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:49.490
take the top left-hand word on every 20th
page of the dictionary, give it to people

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:55.070
in a multiple choice test, correct for guessing,
and multiply by the size of the dictionary,

00:14:55.070 --> 00:15:00.440
you can estimate that a typical high school
graduate has a vocabulary of around 60,000

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:07.040
words, which works out to a rate of learning
of about one new word every two hours starting

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:12.680
from the age of one. &nbsp;When you think that
every one of these words is arbitrary as a

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:19.100
telephone number of a date in history, you’re
reminded about the remarkable capacity of

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:23.700
human long-term memory to store the meanings
and sounds of words. &nbsp;﻿

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:32.290
But of course, we don’t just blurt out individual
words, we combine them into phrases and sentences.

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:38.510
&nbsp;And that brings up the second major component
of language; namely, grammar. &nbsp;﻿

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:45.550
Now the modern study of grammar is inseparable
to the contributions of one linguist, the

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:51.690
famous scholar, Noam Chomsky, who set the
agenda for the field of linguistics for the

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:57.310
last 60 years. ﻿
To begin with, Chomsky noted that the main

00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:03.410
puzzle that we have to explain in understanding
language is creativity or as linguists often

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:09.370
call it productivity, the ability to produce
and understand new sentences. &nbsp;﻿

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:15.620
Except for a small number of clichéd formulas,
just about any sentence that you produce or

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:23.000
understand is a brand new combination produced
for the first time perhaps in your life, perhaps

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.660
even in the history of the species. &nbsp;We have
to explain how people are capable of doing

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:35.380
it. &nbsp;It shows that when we know a language,
we haven’t just memorized a very long list

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:43.330
of sentences, but rather have internalized
a grammar or algorithm or recipe for combining

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:49.380
elements into brand new assemblies. &nbsp;For
that reason, Chomsky has insisted that linguistics

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:56.140
is really properly a branch of psychology
and is a window into the human mind. ﻿

00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:01.940
A second insight is that languages have a
syntax which can’t be identified with their

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:07.329
meaning. &nbsp;Now, the only quotation that I
know of, of a linguist that has actually made

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:12.649
it into Bartlett’s Familiar Quotations,
is the following sentence from Chomsky, from

00:17:12.649 --> 00:17:19.850
1956, “Colorless, green ideas sleep furiously.”
&nbsp;Well, what’s the point of that sentence?

00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:25.410
&nbsp;The point is that it is very close to meaningless.
&nbsp;On the other hand, any English speaker can

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:31.490
instantly recognize that it conforms to the
patterns of English syntax. &nbsp;Compare, for

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:38.270
example, “furiously sleep ideas dream colorless,”
which is also meaningless, but we perceive

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:43.500
as a word salad. &nbsp;﻿
A third insight is that syntax doesn’t consist

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:50.570
of a string of word by word associations as
in stimulus response theories in psychology

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:56.040
where producing a word is a response which
you then hear and it becomes a stimulus to

00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:01.510
producing the next word, and so on. &nbsp;Again,
the sentence, “colorless green ideas sleep

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:07.559
furiously,” can help make this point. &nbsp;Because
if you look at the word by word transition

00:18:07.559 --> 00:18:13.950
probabilities in that sentence, for example,
colorless and then green; how often have you

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:21.210
heard colorless and green in succession. &nbsp;Probably
zero times. &nbsp;Green and ideas, those two words

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:27.550
never occur together, ideas and sleep, sleep
and furiously. &nbsp;Every one of the transition

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:33.590
probabilities is very close to zero, nonetheless,
the sentence as a whole can be perceived as

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:39.330
a well-formed English sentence. &nbsp;﻿
Language in general has long distance dependencies.

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:45.370
&nbsp;The word in one position in a sentence can
dictate the choice of the word several positions

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:50.530
downstream. &nbsp;For example, if you begin a
sentence with “either,” somewhere down

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:55.530
the line, there has to be an “or.” &nbsp;If
you have an “if,” generally, you expect

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:59.840
somewhere down the line there to be a “then.”
&nbsp;There’s a story about a child who says

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:04.950
to his father, “Daddy, why did you bring
that book that I don’t want to be read to

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:12.410
out of, up for?” &nbsp;Where you have a set
of nested or embedded long distance dependencies.

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:15.750
&nbsp;﻿
Indeed, one of the applications of linguistics

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:24.559
to the study of good prose style is that sentences
can be rendered difficult to understand if

00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:30.470
they have too many long distance dependencies
because that could put a strain on the short-term

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:35.700
memory of the reader or listener while trying
to understand them. &nbsp;﻿

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:40.990
Rather than a set of word by word associations,
sentences are assembled in a hierarchical

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:46.150
structure that looks like an upside down tree.
&nbsp;Let me give you an example of how that works

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:50.910
in the case of English. &nbsp;One of the basic
rules of English is that a sentence consists

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:57.010
of a noun phrase, the subject, followed by
a verb phrase, the predicate.﻿

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:03.650
A second rule in turn expands the verb phrase.
&nbsp;A very phrase consists of a verb followed

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:09.960
by a noun phrase, the object, followed by
a sentence, the complement as, “I told him

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.500
that it was sunny outside.” &nbsp;﻿
﻿

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:25.580
Now, why do linguists insist that language
must be composed out of &nbsp;phrase structural

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:27.120
rules? &nbsp;﻿
(1.) Rules allow for open-ended creativity

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.760
﻿Well for one thing, that helps explain
the main phenomenon that we want to explain,

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.140
mainly the open-ended creativity of language.
&nbsp;﻿

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.179
(2.) Rules allow for expression of unfamiliar
meaning﻿

00:20:36.179 --> 00:20:41.910
It allows us to express unfamiliar meanings.
&nbsp;There’s a cliché in journalism for example,

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:46.840
that when a dog bites a man, that isn’t
news, but when a man bites a dog, that is

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:54.510
news. &nbsp;The beauty of grammar is that it allows
us to convey news by assembling into familiar

00:20:54.510 --> 00:21:02.350
word in brand new combinations. &nbsp;Also, because
of the way phrase structure rules work, they

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:05.080
produce a vast number of possible combinations.
﻿

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.080
(3.) Rules allow for production of vast numbers
of combinations﻿

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.810
Moreover, the number of different thoughts
that we can express through the combinatorial

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:15.250
power of grammar is not just humongous, but
in a technical sense, it’s infinite. &nbsp;Now

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:20.020
of course, no one lives an infinite number
of years, and therefore can shell off their

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:24.590
ability to understand an infinite number of
sentences, but you can make the point in the

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:30.799
same way that a mathematician can say that
someone who understands the rules of arithmetic

00:21:30.799 --> 00:21:35.490
knows that there are an infinite number of
numbers, namely if anyone ever claimed to

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:40.420
have found the longest one, you can always
come up with one that’s even bigger by adding

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:45.140
a one to it. &nbsp;And you can do the same thing
with language. &nbsp;﻿

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:50.270
Let me illustrate it in the following way.
&nbsp;As a matter of fact, there has been a claim

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:53.030
that there is a world’s longest sentence.
&nbsp;﻿

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:57.160
Who would make such a claim? &nbsp;Well, who else?
&nbsp;The Guinness Book of World Records. &nbsp;You

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:03.340
can look it up. &nbsp;There is an entry for the
World’s Longest Sentence. &nbsp;It is 1,300

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:08.060
words long. &nbsp;And it comes from a novel by
William Faulkner. &nbsp;Now I won’t read all

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.560
1,300 words, but I’ll just tell you how
it begins. &nbsp;﻿

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:16.929
“They both bore it as though in deliberate
flatulent exaltation…” and it runs on

00:22:16.929 --> 00:22:20.231
from there. ﻿
But I’m here to tell you that in fact, this

00:22:20.231 --> 00:22:25.140
is not the world’s longest sentence. &nbsp;And
I’ve been tempted to obtain immortality

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:30.460
in Guinness by submitting the following record
breaker. &nbsp;"Faulkner wrote, they both bore

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:36.320
it as though in deliberate flatulent exaltation.”
&nbsp;But sadly, this would not be immortality

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:42.660
after all but only the proverbial 15 minutes
of fame because based on what you now know,

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:47.850
you could submit a record breaker for the
record breaker namely, "Guinness noted that

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:53.790
Faulkner wrote" or "Pinker mentioned that
Guinness noted that Faulkner wrote", or "who

00:22:53.790 --> 00:23:08.870
cares that Pinker mentioned that Guinness
noted that Faulkner wrote…" &nbsp;﻿

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:14.150
Take for example, the following wonderfully
ambiguous sentence that appeared in TV Guide.

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:18.900
&nbsp;“On tonight’s program, Conan will discuss
sex with Dr. Ruth.” &nbsp;﻿

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:24.190
Now this has a perfectly innocent meaning
in which the verb, “discuss” involves

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:29.870
two things, namely the topic of discussion,
“sex” and the person with who it’s being

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:35.500
discussed, in this case, with Dr. Ruth. &nbsp;But
is has a somewhat naughtier meaning if you

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:40.380
rearrange the words into phrases according
to a different structure in which case “sex

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:46.700
with Dr. Ruth” is the topic of conversation,
and that’s what’s being discussed. &nbsp;﻿

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:51.090
Now, phrase structure not only can account
for our ability to produce so many sentences,

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:57.320
but it’s also necessary for us to understand
what they mean. &nbsp;The geometry of branches

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:02.740
in a phrase structure is essential to figuring
out who did what to whom.﻿

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:07.610
Another important contribution of Chomsky
to the science of language is the focus on

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:17.820
language acquisition by children. Now, children
can’t memorize sentences because knowledge

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:23.230
of language isn’t just one long list of
memorized sentences, but somehow they must

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:30.570
distill out or abstract out the rules that
goes into assembling sentences based on what

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:36.220
they hear coming out of their parent’s mouths
when they were little. &nbsp;And the talent of

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:43.340
using rules to produce combinations is in
evidence from the moment that kids begin to

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:47.620
speak. &nbsp;﻿
Children create sentences unheard from adults﻿

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:52.640
At the two-word stage, which you typically
see in children who are 18 months or a bit

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:58.790
older, kids are producing the smallest sentences
that deserve to be counted as sentences, namely

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:02.860
two words long. &nbsp;But already it’s clear
that they are putting them together using

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:09.950
rules in their own mind. &nbsp;To take an example,
a child might say, “more outside,” meaning,

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:14.800
take them outside or let them stay outside.
&nbsp;Now, adults don’t say, “more outside.”

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:20.970
&nbsp;So it’s not a phrase that the child simply
memorized by rote, but it shows that already

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:25.919
children are using these rules to put together
new combinations. &nbsp;﻿

00:25:25.919 --> 00:25:32.930
Another example, a child having jam washed
from his fingers said to his mother 'all gone

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:39.700
sticky'.﻿&nbsp;Again, not a phrase that you
could ever have copied from a parent, but

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:43.470
one that shows the child producing new combinations.
&nbsp;﻿

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:50.980
Past tense rule﻿
An easy way of showing that children assimilate

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:57.309
rules of grammar unconsciously from the moment
they begin to speak, is the use of the past

00:25:57.309 --> 00:26:00.750
tense rule. ﻿
For example, children go through a long stage

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:05.940
in which they make errors like, “We holded
the baby rabbits” or “He teared the paper

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:11.630
and then he sticked it.” &nbsp;Cases in which
they over generalize the regular rule of forming

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:16.950
the past tense, add ‘ed’ to irregular
verbs like “hold,” “stick” or “tear.”

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:21.179
&nbsp;And it’s easy to show… it’s easy to
get children to flaunt this ability to apply

00:26:21.179 --> 00:26:28.100
rules productively in a laboratory demonstration
called the Wug Test. &nbsp;You bring a kid into

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:33.790
a lab. &nbsp;You show them a picture of a little
bird and you say, “This is a wug.” &nbsp;And

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:37.270
you show them another picture and you say,
“Well, now there are two of them.” &nbsp;There

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:42.450
are two and children will fill in the gap
by saying “wugs.” &nbsp;Again, a form they

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:47.700
could not have memorize because it’s invented
for the experiment, but it shows that they

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:53.330
have productive mastery of the regular plural
rule in English. &nbsp;﻿

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:58.320
And famously, Chomsky claimed that children
solved the problem of language acquisition

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:04.559
by having the general design of language already
wired into them in the form of a universal

00:27:04.559 --> 00:27:09.990
grammar. &nbsp;﻿
A spec sheet for what the rules of any language

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:14.660
have to look like. &nbsp;﻿

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:19.450
What is the evidence that children are born
with a universal grammar? &nbsp;Well, surprisingly,

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:25.110
Chomsky didn’t propose this by actually
studying kids in the lab or kids in the home,

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:30.080
but through a more abstract argument called,
“The poverty of the input.” &nbsp;Namely,

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:37.020
if you look at what goes into the ears of
a child and look at the talent they end up

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:43.500
with as adults, there is a big chasm between
them that can only be filled in by assuming

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:48.490
that the child has a lot of knowledge of the
way that language works already built in.

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:51.570
&nbsp;﻿
Here’s how the argument works. &nbsp;One of

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:56.470
the things that children have to learn when
they learn English is how to form a question.

00:27:56.470 --> 00:28:03.030
&nbsp;Now, children will get evidence from parent’s
speech to how the question rule works, such

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:08.650
as sentences like, “The man is here,”
﻿and the corresponding question, “Is the

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:13.720
man here?”﻿&nbsp;
&nbsp;Now, logically speaking, a child getting

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:19.140
that kind of input could posit two different
kinds of rules. ﻿There’s a simple word

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:25.190
by word linear rule. &nbsp;In this case, find
the first “is” in the sentence and move

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:30.070
it to the front. &nbsp;“The man is here,”
“Is the man here?” Now there’s a more

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:35.950
complex rule that the child could posit called
a structure dependent rule, one that looks

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:41.460
at the geometry of the phrase structure tree.
&nbsp;In this case, the rule would be: &nbsp;find

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:46.520
the first “is” after the subject noun
phrase and move that to the front of the sentence.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.660
&nbsp;A diagram of what that rule would look like
is as follows: &nbsp;you look for the “is”

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:48.731
that occurs after the subject noun phrase
and that’s what gets moved to the front

00:28:48.731 --> 00:28:51.010
of the sentence.&nbsp;
Now, what’s the difference between the simple

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:56.400
word-by-word rule and the more complex structured
dependent rule? &nbsp;Well, you can see the difference

00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:01.539
when it comes to performing the question from
a slightly more complex sentence like, “The

00:29:01.539 --> 00:29:10.540
man who is tall is 
in the room.” &nbsp;﻿

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:30.220
But how is the child supposed to learn that?
&nbsp;How did all of us end up with the correct

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:36.250
structured dependent of the rule rather than
the far simpler word-by-word version of the

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:39.030
rule? ﻿
“Well,” Chomsky argues, “if you were

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:44.799
actually to look at the kind of language that
all of us hear, it’s actually quite rare

00:29:44.799 --> 00:29:50.520
to hear a sentence like, “Is the man who
is tall in the room? &nbsp;The kind of input that

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:57.039
would logically inform you that the word-by-word
rule is wrong and the structure dependent

00:29:57.039 --> 00:30:03.169
rule is right. &nbsp;Nonetheless, we all grow
up into adults who unconsciously use the structure

00:30:03.169 --> 00:30:09.990
dependent rule rather than the word-by-word
rule. &nbsp;Moreover, children don’t make errors

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:16.610
like, “is the man who tall is in the room,”
as soon as they begin to form complex questions,

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:22.970
they use the structure dependent rule. &nbsp;And
that,” Chomsky argues, “is evidence that

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:29.309
structure dependent rules are part of the
definition of universal grammar that children

00:30:29.309 --> 00:30:32.309
are born with.” &nbsp;﻿

00:30:32.309 --> 00:30:40.650
Now, though Chomsky has been fantastically
influential in the science of language that

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:45.110
does not mean that all language scientists
agree with him. &nbsp;And there have been a number

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:50.799
of critiques of Chomsky over the years. &nbsp;For
one thing, the critics point out, Chomsky

00:30:50.799 --> 00:30:58.179
hasn’t really shown principles of universal
grammar that are specific to language itself

00:30:58.179 --> 00:31:05.970
as opposed to general ways in which the human
mind works across multiple domains, language

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:11.610
and vision and control of motion and memory
and so on. &nbsp;We don’t really know that universal

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:15.010
grammar is specific to language, according
to this critique. ﻿

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:20.059
Secondly, Chomsky and the linguists working
with him have not examined all 6,000 of the

00:31:20.059 --> 00:31:27.730
world’s languages and shown that the principles
of universal grammar apply to all 6,000. &nbsp;They’ve

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:34.190
posited it based on a small number of languages
and the logic of the poverty of the input,

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:38.559
but haven’t actually come through with the
data that would be necessary to prove that

00:31:38.559 --> 00:31:44.500
universal grammar is really universal. &nbsp;﻿
Finally, the critics argue, Chomsky has not

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:52.659
shown that more general purpose learning models,
such as neuro network models, are incapable

00:31:52.659 --> 00:31:57.360
of learning language together with all the
other things that children learn, and therefore

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:03.360
has not proven that there has to be specific
knowledge how grammar works in order for the

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.370
child to learn grammar. &nbsp;&nbsp;﻿

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:13.790
&nbsp;Another component of language governs the
sound pattern of language, the ways that the

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:20.919
vowels and consonants can be assembled into
the minimal units that go into words. &nbsp;Phonology,

00:32:20.919 --> 00:32:27.730
as this branch of linguistics is called, consists
of formation rules that capture what is a

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:34.110
possible word in a language according to the
way that it sounds. &nbsp;&nbsp;To give you an example,

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:40.240
the sequence, bluk, is not an English word,
but you get a sense that it could be an English

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.460
word that someone could coin a new form…
that someone could coin a new term of English

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:50.430
that we pronounce “bluk.” &nbsp;But when you
hear the sound ****, you instantly know thatthat

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:55.030
not only isn’t it an English word, but it
really couldn’t be an English word. &nbsp;****, by

00:32:55.030 --> 00:33:02.059
the way, comes from Yiddish and it means kind
of to sigh or to moan. &nbsp;Oi. &nbsp;That’s to

00:33:02.059 --> 00:33:05.860
****. &nbsp;﻿
The reason that we recognize that it’s not

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:12.400
English is because it has sounds like **** and
sequences like ****, which aren’t part of

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:17.750
the formation rules of English phonology.
&nbsp;But together with the rules that define

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:23.280
the basic words of a language, there are also
phonological rules that make adjustments to

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:30.059
the sounds, depending on what the other words
the word appears with. &nbsp;Very few of us realize,

00:33:30.059 --> 00:33:35.169
for example, in English, that the past tense
suffix “ed” ﻿is actually pronounced

00:33:35.169 --> 00:33:41.559
in three different ways. &nbsp;When we say, “He
walked,” ﻿we pronounce the “ed” like

00:33:41.559 --> 00:33:48.350
a “ta,” walked. &nbsp;When we say “jogged,”
﻿we pronounce it as a “d,” jogged. &nbsp;And

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:54.860
when we say “patted,”﻿&nbsp;we stick in
a vowel, pat-ted, showing that the same suffix,

00:33:54.860 --> 00:34:00.870
“ed” can be readjusted in its pronunciation
according to the rules of English phonology.

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:04.909
&nbsp;﻿
Now, when someone acquires English as a foreign

00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:10.669
language or acquires a foreign language in
general, they carry over the rules of phonology

00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:15.390
of their first language and apply it to their
second language. &nbsp;We have a word for it;

00:34:15.390 --> 00:34:20.780
we call it an “accent.” &nbsp;When a language
user deliberately manipulates the rules of

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:25.539
phonology, that is, when they don’t just
speak in order to convey content, they pay

00:34:25.539 --> 00:34:37.719
attention as to what phonological structures
are being used; we call it poetry and rhetoric.

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:38.719
&nbsp;﻿

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:42.629
So far, I’ve been talking about knowledge
of language, the rules that go into defining

00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:48.609
what are possible sequences of language. &nbsp;But
those sequences have to get into the brain

00:34:48.609 --> 00:34:53.399
during speech comprehension and they have
to get out during speech production. &nbsp;And

00:34:53.399 --> 00:34:56.409
that takes us to the topic of language interfaces.
&nbsp;﻿

00:34:56.409 --> 00:35:01.539
And let’s start with production. &nbsp;﻿

00:35:01.539 --> 00:35:09.650
This diagram here is literally a human cadaver
that has been sawn in half. &nbsp;An anatomist

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:16.989
took a saw and [sound] allowing it to see
in cross section the human vocal tract. &nbsp;And

00:35:16.989 --> 00:35:22.640
that can illustrate how we get out knowledge
of language out into the world as a sequence

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:27.119
of sounds. &nbsp;﻿
Now, each of us has at the top of our windpipe

00:35:27.119 --> 00:35:33.700
or trachea, a complex structure called the
larynx or voice box; it’s behind your Adam’s

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:41.829
Apple. &nbsp;And the air coming out of your lungs
have to go passed two cartilaginous flaps

00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:50.349
that vibrate and produce a rich, buzzy sound
source, full of harmonics. &nbsp;Before that vibrating

00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:55.670
sound gets out to the world, it has to pass
through a gauntlet or chambers of the vocal

00:35:55.670 --> 00:36:03.990
tract. &nbsp;The throat behind the tongue, the
cavity above the tongue, the cavity formed

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:09.690
by the lips, and when you block off airflow
through the mouth, it can come out through

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:13.710
the nose. &nbsp;﻿
Now, each one of those cavities has a shape

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:19.469
that, thanks to the laws of physics, will
amplify some of the harmonics in that buzzy

00:36:19.469 --> 00:36:25.920
sound source and suppress others. &nbsp;We can
change the shape of those cavities when we

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:31.069
move our tongue around. &nbsp;When we move our
tongue forward and backward, for example,

00:36:31.069 --> 00:36:37.759
as in “eh,” “aa,” “eh,” “aa,”
we change the shape of the cavity behind the

00:36:37.759 --> 00:36:44.309
tongue, change the frequencies that are amplified
or suppressed and the listener hears them

00:36:44.309 --> 00:36:49.390
as two different vowels. &nbsp;﻿
Likewise, when we raise or lower the tongue,

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:55.329
we change the shape of the resonant cavity
above the tongue as in say, “eh,” “ah,”

00:36:55.329 --> 00:37:02.009
“eh,” “ah.” &nbsp;Once again, the change
in the mixture of harmonics is perceived as

00:37:02.009 --> 00:37:08.950
a change in the nature of the vowel. &nbsp;﻿
When we stop the flow of air and then release

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:16.019
it as in, “t,” “ca,” “ba.” &nbsp;Then
we hear a consonant rather than a vowel or

00:37:16.019 --> 00:37:23.170
even when we restrict the flow of air as in
“f,” “ss” producing a chaotic noisy

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:30.579
sound. &nbsp;Each one of those sounds that gets
sculpted by different articulators is perceived

00:37:30.579 --> 00:37:34.680
by the brain as a qualitatively different
vowel or consonant. &nbsp;﻿

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:42.059
Now, an interesting peculiarity of the human
vocal track is that it obviously co-ops structures

00:37:42.059 --> 00:37:47.749
that evolved for different purposes for breathing
and for swallowing and so on. &nbsp;And it’s

00:37:47.749 --> 00:37:52.630
an… And it’s an interesting fact first
noted by Darwin that the larynx over the course

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:59.109
of evolution has descended in the throat so
that every particle of food going from the

00:37:59.109 --> 00:38:04.989
mouth through the esophagus to the stomach
has to pass over the opening into the larynx

00:38:04.989 --> 00:38:11.299
with some probability of being inhaled leading
to the danger of death by choking. &nbsp;And in

00:38:11.299 --> 00:38:16.880
fact, until the invention of the Heimlich
Maneuver, several thousand people every year

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:23.650
died of choking because of this maladaptive
of the human vocal tract. ﻿

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:28.829
Why did we evolve a mouth and throat that
leaves us vulnerable to choking? &nbsp;Well, a

00:38:28.829 --> 00:38:34.270
plausible hypothesis is that it’s a compromise
that was made in the course of evolution to

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:41.390
allow us to speak. &nbsp;By giving range to a
variety of possibilities for alternating the

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:47.790
resonant cavities, for moving the tongue back
and forth and up and down, we expanded the

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:53.680
range of speech sounds we could make, improve
the efficiency of language, but suffered the

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:59.809
compromise of an increased risk of choking
showing that language presumably had some

00:38:59.809 --> 00:39:05.960
survival advantage that compensated for the
disadvantage in choking. &nbsp;﻿

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:10.790
What about the flow of information in the
other direction, that is from the world into

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:17.019
the brain, the process of speech comprehension?
&nbsp;﻿

00:39:17.019 --> 00:39:23.630
Speech comprehension turns out to be an extraordinarily
complex computational process, which we're

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:31.579
reminded of every time we interact with a
voicemail menu on a telephone or you use a

00:39:31.579 --> 00:39:39.230
dictation on our computers. &nbsp;For example,
One writer, using the state-of-the-art speech-to-text

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:46.589
systems dictated the following words into
his computer. &nbsp;He dictated “book tour,”

00:39:46.589 --> 00:39:51.859
and it came out on the screen as “back to
work.” &nbsp;Another example, he said, “I

00:39:51.859 --> 00:39:58.230
truly couldn’t see,” and it came out on
the screen as, “a cruelly good MC.” &nbsp;Even

00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:03.940
more disconcertingly, he started a letter
to his parents by saying, “Dear mom and

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:08.079
dad,” and what came out on the screen, “The
man is dead.” &nbsp;﻿&nbsp;﻿

00:40:08.079 --> 00:40:12.849
Now, dictation systems have gotten better
and better, but they still have a way to go

00:40:12.849 --> 00:40:16.619
before they can duplicate a human stenographer.
&nbsp;﻿

00:40:16.619 --> 00:40:21.739
What is it about the problem of speech understanding
that makes it so easy for a human, ﻿but

00:40:21.739 --> 00:40:28.400
so hard for a computer? Well, there are two
main contributors. &nbsp;One of them is the fact

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:34.619
that each phony, each vowel or consonant actually
comes out very differently, depending on what

00:40:34.619 --> 00:40:39.390
comes before and what comes after. &nbsp;A phenomenon
sometimes called co-articulation. &nbsp;﻿

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:46.270
Let me give you an example. &nbsp;The place called
Cape Cod has two “c” sounds. &nbsp;﻿

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:52.130
 Each of them symbolized by the letter “C,”
the hard “C.” &nbsp;Nonetheless, when you

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:55.910
pay attention to the way you pronounce them,
you notice that in fact, you pronounce them

00:40:55.910 --> 00:41:02.109
in very different parts of the mouth. &nbsp;Try
it. &nbsp;Cape Cod, Cape Cod… “c,” “c”.

00:41:02.109 --> 00:41:08.609
&nbsp;In one case, the “c” is produced way
back in the mouth; the other it’s produced

00:41:08.609 --> 00:41:13.780
much farther forward. &nbsp;We don’t notice
that we pronounce “c” in two different

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:20.019
ways depending whether it comes before an
“a” or an “ah,” but that difference

00:41:20.019 --> 00:41:25.240
forms a difference in the shape of the resonant
cavity in our mouth which produces a very

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:31.680
different wave form. &nbsp;And unless a computer
is specifically programmed to take that variability

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:37.989
into account, it will perceive those two different
“c’s,” as a different sound that objectively

00:41:37.989 --> 00:41:44.560
speaking, they really are: &nbsp;“c-eh” “c-oa”.
&nbsp;They really are different sounds, but our

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:48.829
brain lumps them together. &nbsp;﻿
The other reason that speech recognition is

00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:55.359
such a difficult problem is because of the
absence of segmentation. &nbsp;Now we have an

00:41:55.359 --> 00:42:02.319
illusion when we listen to speech that consists
of a sequence to sounds corresponding to words.

00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:07.450
&nbsp;But if you actually were to look at the
wave form of a sentence on a oscilloscope,

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:11.200
there would not be little silences between
the words the way there are little bits of

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:17.339
white space in printed words on a page, but
rather a continuous ribbon in which the end

00:42:17.339 --> 00:42:21.029
of one word leads right to the beginning of
the next. &nbsp;﻿

00:42:21.029 --> 00:42:22.569
It’s something that we’re aware of…
It’s something that we’re aware of when

00:42:22.569 --> 00:42:27.519
we listen to speech in a foreign language
when we have no idea where one word ends and

00:42:27.519 --> 00:42:33.209
the other one begins. &nbsp;In our own language,
we detect the word boundaries simply because

00:42:33.209 --> 00:42:38.589
in our mental lexicon, we have stretches of
sound that correspond to one word that tell

00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:44.329
us where it ends. &nbsp;But you can’t get that
information from the wave form itself. &nbsp;﻿

00:42:44.329 --> 00:42:49.490
In fact, there’s a whole genre of wordplay
that takes advantage of the fact that word

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:55.930
boundaries are not physically present in the
speech wave. &nbsp;Novelty songs like Mairzy doats

00:42:55.930 --> 00:43:00.969
and dozy doats and liddle lamzy divey﻿&nbsp; A
kiddley divey too, wooden shoe? ﻿  Now,

00:43:00.969 --> 00:43:06.690
it turns out that this is actually a grammatical
sequence in words in English… Mares eat

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:16.059
oats and does eat oats and little lambs eat
ivy, a kid'll eat ivy too, wouldn’t you?﻿

00:43:16.059 --> 00:43:23.989
When it is spoken or sung normally, the boundaries
between words are obliterated and so the same

00:43:23.989 --> 00:43:29.530
sequence of sounds can be perceived either
as nonsense or if you know what they’re

00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:35.279
meant to convey, as sentences. &nbsp;﻿
Another example familiar to most children,

00:43:35.279 --> 00:43:40.589
﻿Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear, Fuzzy Wuzzy had
no hair. &nbsp;Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn’t very fuzzy,

00:43:40.589 --> 00:43:49.099
was he? &nbsp;And the famous dogroll, I scream,
you scream, we all scream for ice cream. ﻿

00:43:49.099 --> 00:43:55.519
We are generally unaware of how unambiguous
language is. &nbsp;In context, we effortlessly

00:43:55.519 --> 00:44:02.479
and unconsciously derive the intended meaning
of a sentence, but a poor computer not equipped

00:44:02.479 --> 00:44:08.609
with all of our common sense and human abilities
and just going by the words and the rules

00:44:08.609 --> 00:44:14.280
is often flabbergasted by all the different
possibilities. &nbsp;Take a sentence as simple

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:19.680
as “Mary had a little lamb,” ﻿you might
think that that’s a perfectly simple unambiguous

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:24.709
sentence. &nbsp;But now imagine that it was continued
with “with mint sauce.” &nbsp;You realize

00:44:24.709 --> 00:44:30.359
that “have” is actually a highly ambiguous
word.﻿&nbsp;As a result, the computer translations

00:44:30.359 --> 00:44:34.869
can often deliver comically incorrect results.
&nbsp;﻿

00:44:34.869 --> 00:44:39.630
According to legend, one of the first computer
systems that was designed to translate from

00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:45.400
English to Russian and back again did the
following given the sentence, “The spirit

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:50.900
is willing, but the flesh is weak,” it translated
it back as “The vodka is agreeable, but

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:59.680
the meat is rotten.” ﻿
So why do people understand language so much

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:05.380
better than computers? &nbsp;What is the knowledge
that we have that has been so hard to program

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:11.140
into our machines? &nbsp;Well, there’s a third
interface between language and the rest of

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:17.509
the mind, and that is the subject matter of
the branch of linguistics called Pragmatics,

00:45:17.509 --> 00:45:25.440
namely, how people understand language in
context using their knowledge of the world

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:29.229
and their expectation about how other speakers
communicate. &nbsp;﻿

00:45:29.229 --> 00:45:34.059
The most important principle of Pragmatics
is called “the cooperative principle,”

00:45:34.059 --> 00:45:40.209
namely; assume that your conversational partner
is working with you to try to get a meaning

00:45:40.209 --> 00:45:46.359
across truthfully and clearly. &nbsp;And our knowledge
of Pragmatics, like our knowledge of syntax

00:45:46.359 --> 00:45:53.660
and phonology and so on, is deployed effortlessly,
but involves many intricate computations.

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:58.880
&nbsp;For example, if I were to say, “If you
could pass the guacamole, that would be awesome.”

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:05.499
&nbsp;You understand that as a polite request
meaning, give me the guacamole. &nbsp;You don’t

00:46:05.499 --> 00:46:12.579
interpret it literally as a rumination about
a hypothetical affair, you just assume that

00:46:12.579 --> 00:46:18.469
the person wanted something and was using
that string of words to convey the request

00:46:18.469 --> 00:46:23.529
politely. &nbsp;﻿
Often comedies will use the absence of pragmatics

00:46:23.529 --> 00:46:29.740
in robots as a source of humor. &nbsp;As in the
old “Get Smart” situation comedy, which

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:35.630
had a robot named, Hymie, and a recurring
joke in the series would be that Maxwell Smart

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:41.819
would say to Hymie, “Hymie, can you give
me a hand?” &nbsp;And then Hymie would go, {sound},

00:46:41.819 --> 00:46:47.599
remove his hand and pass it over to Maxwell
Smart not understanding that “give me a

00:46:47.599 --> 00:46:53.719
hand,” in context means, help me rather
than literally transfer the hand over to me.

00:46:53.719 --> 00:46:56.010
&nbsp;﻿
Or take the following example of Pragmatics

00:46:56.010 --> 00:47:01.329
in action. &nbsp;Consider the following dialogue,
Martha says, “I’m leaving you.” &nbsp;John

00:47:01.329 --> 00:47:07.989
says, “Who is he?” &nbsp;Now, understanding
language requires finding the antecedents

00:47:07.989 --> 00:47:14.829
pronouns, in this case who the “he” refers
to, and any competent English speaker knows

00:47:14.829 --> 00:47:20.940
exactly who the “he” is, presumably John’s
romantic rival even though it was never stated

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:28.289
explicitly in any part of the dialogue. &nbsp;This
shows how we bring to bear on language understanding

00:47:28.289 --> 00:47:35.890
a vast store of knowledge about human behavior,
human interactions, human relationships. &nbsp;And

00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:43.720
we often have to use that background knowledge
even to solve mechanical problems like, who

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:49.619
does a pronoun like “he” refer to. &nbsp;It’s
that knowledge that’s extraordinarily difficult,

00:47:49.619 --> 00:47:58.150
to say the least to program into a computer.
&nbsp;﻿

00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:03.369
Language is a miracle of the natural world
because it allows us to exchange an unlimited

00:48:03.369 --> 00:48:11.890
number of ideas using a finite set of mental
tools. &nbsp;Those mental tools comprise a large

00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:19.719
lexicon of memorized words and a powerful
mental grammar that can combine them. &nbsp;Language

00:48:19.719 --> 00:48:26.229
thought of in this way should not be confused
with writing, with the prescriptive rules

00:48:26.229 --> 00:48:31.940
of proper grammar or style or with thought
itself. &nbsp;﻿

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:36.819
Modern linguistics is guided by the questions,
though not always the answers suggested by

00:48:36.819 --> 00:48:43.459
the linguist known as Noam Chomsky, namely
how is the unlimited creativity of language

00:48:43.459 --> 00:48:50.670
possible? &nbsp;What are the abstract mental structures
that relate word to one another? How do children

00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:54.529
acquire them? &nbsp;﻿
What is universal across languages? &nbsp;And

00:48:54.529 --> 00:49:04.209
what does that say about the human mind? &nbsp;﻿
The study of language has many practical applications

00:49:04.209 --> 00:49:10.160
including computers that understand and speak,
the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders,

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:17.019
the teaching of reading, writing, and foreign
languages, the interpreting of the language

00:49:17.019 --> 00:49:22.760
of law, politics and literature.﻿
But for someone like me, language is eternally

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:29.479
fascinating because it speaks to such fundamental
questions of the human condition. &nbsp;﻿[Language]

00:49:29.479 --> 00:49:35.130
is really at the center of a number of different
concerns of thought, of social relationships,

00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:41.390
of human biology, of human evolution, that
all speak to what’s special about the human

00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:45.049
species. ﻿
Language is the most distinctively human talent.

00:49:45.049 --> 00:49:49.509
&nbsp;Language is a window into human nature,
and most significantly,﻿&nbsp;the vast expressive

00:49:49.509 --> 00:49:55.869
power of language is one of the wonders of
the natural world. &nbsp;Thank you.﻿
