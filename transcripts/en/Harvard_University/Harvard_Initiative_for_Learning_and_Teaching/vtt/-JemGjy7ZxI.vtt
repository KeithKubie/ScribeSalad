00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.330
With each of these
projects, we'll

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.250
introduce the set
of questions that

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.310
motivate the work and
the key constituencies.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.790
So here, what are the student
patterns of course choice

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.630
within the gov department?

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.870
How do they change for
subgroups of students?

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.420
What are the relationships
between courses?

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.850
What are the learning
objectives for each course?

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.230
And then, the key
constituencies,

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.000
undergraduate students
and the gov department.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.140
Where do we want to be with
this project one year from now?

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.680
All FAS departments
actively using

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.922
a version of Enrollment
View, faculty discovering

00:00:44.922 --> 00:00:45.880
their nearest neighbor.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.940
And here, we get to another
curriculum mapping project--

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.370
Andrew Ho, who-- we'll talk
about this in a minute.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.140
The Nearest Neighbor
Project has now

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.620
sort of integrated a little
bit with the Enrollment View

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.520
project.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.280
And that's where we
hope these things go,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.800
is we begin to think that the
synergies and the integrations.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.850
And then the hope from
the particular point

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.270
of view of this project for
curriculum mapping at Harvard

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.900
broadly--

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.360
surface enrollment
patterns within departments

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.950
and across departments,
teaching your class

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.944
mindful of other classes
that your students are in.

00:01:23.944 --> 00:01:25.360
And there's a
pretty picture here.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.040
And I'm not going to talk
about the pretty picture,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.985
because Dustin's going to talk
about the pretty picture now.

00:01:34.597 --> 00:01:37.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.550
Thank you, Erin, for
the introduction.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.820
If I'm a jumpstarter, I hope
I'm on the positive side

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.110
of the lead.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.300
So my name's Dustin Tingley.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.980
I am a professor of government.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.239
I'm also the faculty
director of VPAL research.

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:51.780
This is kind of a little bit of
an explanation of what we do.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.290
And we have a really fortunate
role in the university--

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.680
to straddle the online space
and working with our partners

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.910
in Harvard X, but
also residential.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.340
And that gives us
an opportunity to be

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.110
aware of a variety of different
approaches to education,

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.790
a variety of different
types of data

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.040
streams that come out
of those approaches,

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.080
and really trying to
leverage insights that

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.040
come from both sides.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.500
How do we help Harvard
X with what we learn

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.910
from the residential space?

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.430
And how do we enhance the
residential space given

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.860
what we know from Harvard X?

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.130
I should say that this is
framed around VPAL research,

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.880
but in doing so, we definitely
work very closely with folks

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.330
over in HUIT who,
control a lot of the data

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.370
systems and whatnot.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.690
They're a huge partner.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.665
I'm just really glad to see
some folks from HUIT here today.

00:02:42.665 --> 00:02:44.040
So what I'm going
to do, briefly,

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.150
is to just kind of
layout that Harvard

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.400
has this huge, rich array of
different sources of data that

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.880
touch on teaching and learning,
ranging from the student

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.530
information system,
the course catalog,

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.307
the Canvas Learning
Management System.

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:03.890
This is where you're
running a course,

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:04.973
you have a course website.

00:03:04.973 --> 00:03:08.400
This is where you go
to find a syllabus

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.670
or engage in a discussion forum
or find readings, et cetera.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.370
We have student evaluation data.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.580
I'm not going to talk
about any of that,

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.910
but that's a really
rich source of data.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.380
We have a whole range of
Harvard YouTube channels.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.810
So these are official
Harvard YouTube channels,

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.240
and there's a lot of
great content on it.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.610
We have Harvard X. And
then, we have a whole layer

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.450
of really just being mindful of
who should get access to what

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.010
data and what information.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.710
I don't need to get access
to all of the information

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.710
that someone in institutional
research can get access to.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:41.640
I don't need that.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.660
And so we're very mindful of
thinking through authentication

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.220
and just sort of permissions.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.160
And here, HarvardKey,
which has really

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.340
come online in a major way
in the past couple years,

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.000
has been really helpful
for a variety of projects.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.580
So the student information
system, many of you

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.430
might think about this is
something like my.harvard.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.242
And this is a place
where students go.

00:04:04.242 --> 00:04:06.450
It's where they're going to
do different registration

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.950
operations, et cetera.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.960
And this is kind of not just
an interface for students

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.570
and for faculty and
for staff, but it also

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.060
has a big data layer
behind it, right?

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.234
And that data layer
is very valuable.

00:04:21.234 --> 00:04:22.650
I'll showcase a
couple of the ways

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.190
that we've been
thinking about it.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.770
And it's not just some
projects that I've worked on.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.270
But there's also
been other projects

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.490
that have benefited
from the nice work

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.210
that HUIT has put into
architecting the database back

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.360
end for my.harvard.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.000
So one example of this
is the Enrollment View.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.750
So this is literally just asking
a question of, what courses--

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.900
if someone has taken a
course in the gov department,

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.600
what were the other
courses that they took?

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.200
What sequence of
courses did they take?

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.150
Or, to get to Andrew
Ho's brilliant idea

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.060
about nearest neighbors,
if I'm teaching a course,

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.380
what are the other courses that
my students are enrolled in?

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.240
That's actually really
valuable information.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.970
What are they experiencing as
they are going through what

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.789
I want them to experience?

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:13.080
And we'll talk a little bit
more about nearest neighbor

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.200
in a second.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.320
And you can think
about these things.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.990
So this is going to be for
the physics department,

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.790
so we've been working
with them, as well.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.140
So I'm teaching a class.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.780
There are these other classes
that students are enrolled in.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.460
You can even see the second
order nearest neighbor.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.990
This is like not your neighbor,
but the neighbor down street.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.260
And what classes that
overlap are happening there?

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.350
Or what's the sequence of
classes that people are taking?

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.120
What have people
taken before my class,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.426
and what do people statistically
tend to take afterwards?

00:05:42.426 --> 00:05:43.800
And then, finally,
there's always

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.080
questions about, like, are
there trends in enrollment

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.420
that we sort of, within the
department, administratively

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.560
look at?

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.110
And so this is something
that we will be rolling out

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.170
to a whole range
of FAS departments,

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.150
working quite closely
with Harvard's

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.120
institutional research and
our friends over in HUIT

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.470
to be able to do.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.300
Another project was just saying,
let's bring together easy ways

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.100
to just search
course descriptions.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.130
And this was an effort that
arose out of our friends

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.590
in the Safra Center
for Ethics just wanting

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.920
to know where are
people teaching ethics.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.860
And so we were able to,
again, work with folks at HUIT

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.640
to be able to import all of the
course description information

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.690
that we could get.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.400
Also, grab some of
that information

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.190
for some of the other schools
that aren't on my.harvard

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.660
and put it in one place.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.030
Make it searchable
and do all sorts of--

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.780
be able to make nice
plots of different things.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.960
You know, a challenge of--

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.220
this is not really a challenge.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.120
It's just sort of a
reality, is that we

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.317
are a little bit spread out
in terms of our data systems.

00:06:48.317 --> 00:06:48.900
And that's OK.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:49.720
That's changing.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.930
This is a little bit of
a moving target, as well.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.310
This is not sort
of fixed in stone.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.760
It might change in the coming
months and year and whatnot,

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.030
but there are some different
data systems out there.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.250
We have been working
a lot with sort

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.090
of the my.harvard
kind of back end,

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.710
but there are some
others out there.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.040
And one of the
things that we do is

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.670
to try to think about kind
of common underlying things.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.010
So that even if people have
different data systems,

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.530
we can bring that
data together and have

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.430
it be meaningful to be
co-located together.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.260
A final piece that
really, I think,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.890
highlights the opportunities
for merging data

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.230
from a whole variety
of systems, this

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.940
is the syllabus
exploration tool.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.690
This is something that is now
available to anyone in FAS.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:38.010
You can go to
syllabus.hmdc.harvard.edu,

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:42.600
and you can search across
most of the syllabi that

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.460
are used in the FAS.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.180
So how do we do that?

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:51.310
So what's one thing that
you're supposed to do,

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.730
if you're an instructor,
on your Canvas site?

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:55.563
What's one thing that
you're supposed to do?

00:07:55.563 --> 00:07:57.070
What should you do?

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.150
You should post your syllabus.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:04.260
Now, you're going to do that
in a variety of different ways,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.690
because I can see that data.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.740
There are particular ways
we prefer you to do it,

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:09.281
but whatever.

00:08:09.281 --> 00:08:11.170
We'll figure it out.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.780
And so what we did is we--

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.030
working very closely
with Dean Mike Smith--

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.990
went out and got
syllabi from across all

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.820
of these different courses.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.570
Took those files, extracted
the text from them,

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.580
and then essentially
made it searchable.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.860
So you can go in, and you
can find people's syllabi

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.130
and actually get the actual
file that was their syllabus.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:36.210
And think of these syllabi
as being, essentially,

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:37.990
like a curated reading list.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.620
So if you're writing
a senior thesis

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.570
and you're interested
in some topic,

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.480
well, one thing you could do is
you could go to Google and type

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.650
in that topic.

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.560
And then who knows where
you're going, right?

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.720
But why not, if you
could, in a sense,

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.290
Google the inside of some of the
most brilliant people's minds

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.600
in the world and see what
they would suggest reading,

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.480
given your topic, that would
be a much greater opportunity.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.970
So the syllabus project
took information

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.040
from Canvas, the learning
management system,

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.160
on the one hand,
brought it together

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.220
with some other information from
the operational data storage

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.600
system in HUIT, and put
those things together.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.480
And now we have this
as a product for FAS.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.580
And furthermore, it's
been written in a way

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.162
that we hope some of our
friends from other schools

00:09:23.162 --> 00:09:24.870
would be interested
in joining the party.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.880
So at some point, this
could be something

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.600
like syllabus.harvard.edu
and really scale

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.870
across the institution.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.870
That's a dream right now,
but I'm a jumpstarter,

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.710
so I'll leave it there.
