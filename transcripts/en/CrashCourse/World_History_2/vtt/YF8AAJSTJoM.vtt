00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.110
Hi. I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World
History and today we're going to talk about

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:04.780
climate change.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.600
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, that's not history;
that's science, and also, I don't think that's even happening.

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.099
Yeah, two things, Me From the Past: One, uh,
contemporary climate change is real. Uh, two,

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.200
this isn't the first time the world has experienced
disruptive climate change, believe it or not.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.539
So, climate change, of course, can be a very
controversial topic, at least here in the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.000
US, but we're not discussing today whether
contemporary climate change is caused by human

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.180
activity, although it is. We're talking about
history, and history is never controversial.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.890
We know that climate change can happen because
it has happened. In fact, although we're living

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.790
in an age of global warming today, for most
of the early modern period, the globe experienced

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.790
cool temperatures. Some historians have called
this the Little Ice Age, which would make

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.670
a great animated movie. Someone should get
on that. Anyway, good job, historians, giving

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.900
something an evocative name for once. I'm
picturing a tiny little ice ball, like a snow globe.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.750
Apparently, the Earth was regular-sized back
then, but anyway, the Little Ice Age lasted

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.110
from the thirteenth through the nineteenth
centuries and it was a period when average

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.990
temperatures were cooler than they are now.
This doesn't mean that it was always cold,

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.280
though; there were volatile shifts between
bitterly cold winters and wet summers and

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.420
long droughts. Also, weather conditions were
not always the same in all parts of the world,

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.920
kind of like how the winter of 2014 was terribly
cold in the United States but still one of

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.510
the warmest on record worldwide. Climate is
not weather.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.000
So, we know temperatures were colder partly
because of science but also because of history.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.600
Science has shown through the study of stuff
like tree rings and ice cores that it really

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.060
was colder back then. But we also know this
from history. I mean, records kept at the

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.460
time by monks, and wine-makers, and others
also reported cold weather and bad harvests.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.020
Bad harvests are crucial to our understanding
of the Little Ice Age because they were catastrophic

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.650
events, bringing hunger and, in some cases,
starvation to millions of people. And because

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.590
they were so catastrophic, people wrote about
them, which leaves us a historical record.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.319
Less food meant more disease and also more
crime. Poor harvests often led to civil unrest,

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.810
especially bread riots. For some, a sensible
strategy was to hit the road or, in the case

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.340
of the Norseman, hit the sea. In fact, sometime
during this period, their search for better

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.170
fishing grounds led them to America.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.280
And humans also prove very innovative when
adapting to new climate extremes. One example

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.220
near to my heart is the Netherlands, where
people developed water control systems and

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.900
experimented with new agricultural technology
to make farms less vulnerable to terrible

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.010
weather events like floods.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.090
But the Little Ice Age led to unpredictable
harvests around the world and without, like,

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.879
Spam to fall back on, a couple bad harvests
in a row was fatal.

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.379
So, the whole Little Ice Age was pretty bad
but the seventeenth century was the worst.

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.020
Some historians even refer to it as a period
of global crisis. I mean, here are just a

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.540
few examples of the political instability
in the seventeenth century: the English revolutions

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.420
of 1640 and 1689, Spain's European Wars and
debt problems, peasant and urban worker uprisings

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.069
in Italy, the fall of the Ming and the rise
of the Qing Dynasties in China, a succession

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.239
crisis in the Ottoman Empire, wars between
colonists and Native Americans that nearly

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.379
destroyed Britain's colonies, the Mughal Wars
of Succession, oh, and the Thirty Years War.

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.019
And that's not even to mention Shakespeare.
No Little Ice Age, no Shakespeare. That's

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.739
what I would argue. Totally a climate-dependant
writer. I would be just as good as him if

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.810
only we were in a period of climate change.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.019
Now, obviously, we can't say that all of these
upheavals were caused by cooler temperatures,

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.540
but they did correlate with them, and in many
cases, weather contributed to them. Unrest

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.250
was often linked to food shortages and taxes.
The taxes were high and the food was short

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.989
because the harvests were bad.

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.750
Now, for many people in the seventeenth century,
the cause of the calamitous bad weather was

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.459
obvious: human sinfulness. As Welsh historian
James Howell wrote in 1647, "God Almighty

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.159
has a quarrel lately with all mankind, and
given the reins to the ill spirit to compass

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:58.690
the whole Earth." Others blamed bad weather
on witches, always a safe bet, or on natural

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.530
phenomena like eclipses, earthquakes, comets,
or sunspots. And they might not have been

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.140
totally wrong. Well, they were totally wrong
about the witches, but- but there were fewer

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.870
recorded sunspots, especially in 1617 and
1618, when the Thirty Years War began. Oh,

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.169
and there were twelve volcanic eruptions between
1638 and 1644, which produced dust veils that

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.099
might have made the whole planet cooler.

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:21.869
The weather in the middle of the seventeenth
century, right around the time of the English

00:04:21.869 --> 00:04:27.680
Revolution, was especially bad, like in Massachusetts,
1642 was so cold that the bay froze, while

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.270
in Indonesia, the droughts caused rice harvests
to fail. Much of Africa faced droughts between

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.050
1640 and 1644 and in 1643, flooding in the
Low Countries was so bad that cows and chickens

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.099
ended up in trees. And Scandinavia recorded
its coldest winter ever in 1641. And these

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:49.419
changes in weather were profoundly disruptive
because much more than today, people depended

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.389
directly on agriculture, and thus the weather,
for their livelihoods.

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.339
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:59.919
So, according to historian Thomas C. Smith,
"Farming, with its allied tasks, was the principal

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.969
occupation and nearly the sole source of income
for most families, and its rhythms defined

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:10.729
the annual cycle of work, rest and worship.
Severe annual variations in the harvest reverberated

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.949
through family life..." According to Geoffrey
Parker, a fall of two degrees Celsius during

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:19.860
the growing season, precisely the scale of
global cooling in the 1640s, reduces rice

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.939
harvest yields by between thirty and fifty
percent. "In latitudes north of the temperate

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:29.099
zone,' each fall of 0.5 degrees Celsius in
mean summer temperature decreases the number

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:34.969
of days on which crops ripen by 10 per cent,
doubles the risk of a single harvest failure,

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:39.939
and increases the risk of a double failure
six fold." Harvest failures led to food shortages

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:45.409
which led to everything from stunting via
malnutrition to rising food prices. A 30 percent

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:49.770
reduction in the grain harvest often doubled
the price of bread, whereas a fifty percent

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.930
reduction quintupled it. And when people have
to spend more on food, they don't have money

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.129
to spend on other stuff, which means the people
who make that other stuff are suddenly unemployed

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:03.270
and hungry. And then, hunger itself reduced
the amount of available food by diminishing

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:09.279
people's capacity to work, since a decrease
from 2,500 to 2,000 calories halves our ability

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:14.699
to work efficiently because the body's basic
metabolism still requires 1,500 calories.

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:19.029
And hungry people are also more susceptible
to disease. Add together floods, droughts,

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:23.080
harvest failures, and disease, and you get
a vicious cycle leading to population decline,

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.149
which is exactly what happened in the seventeenth
century.

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:30.189
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So, all of that is
pretty horrible, but human suffering in the

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:34.679
seventeenth century wasn't just caused by
cold and drought. There was also a lot of

00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:39.669
war going on. And these wars between and within
states multiplied the effects of hunger as

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:44.520
soldiers looted wherever they went. Like the
Chinese even coined a word for soldiers' bad

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:50.580
behavior: binghuo, which means "soldier calamity".
And then, to add injury to injury, the costs

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.369
of most of these wars were borne by the peasants,
who suffered doubly as their taxes went to

00:06:55.369 --> 00:07:00.289
pay for the king's wars, which brought soldier
calamity. These taxes were often on staples

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:05.309
like bread, and so they often led to bread
riots, which were not great for morale.

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:10.779
And yes, terrible weather could even contribute
to the fall of dynasties. The 1641 drought

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:16.409
in China was so bad that the Grand Canal began
to dry up for the only time in history, which

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:20.499
reduced rice shipments to China's capitol.
Unable to feed the people, the Ming emperor

00:07:20.499 --> 00:07:25.889
surrendered to the Qing in 1644. Drought and
cold had also encouraged the Qing to overthrow

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:30.149
the Ming in the first place as poor harvests
in Manchuria convinced their leaders that

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:35.349
invading China was the only way to avoid catastrophe.
And then the Qing got to China and they were

00:07:35.349 --> 00:07:38.899
like, "Where's all your food?" and they were
like, "Yeah, the whole planet is colder, not

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:42.199
just Korea." But then they were already there
so they decided to have a dynasty for a while.

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:43.610
I am your history teacher.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:47.309
So, obviously, protests and rebellions were
public responses to the hunger and war, but

00:07:47.309 --> 00:07:51.479
many people confronted the problem of hunger
by trying to reduce the number of mouths they

00:07:51.479 --> 00:07:55.770
had to feed. They could do this by reducing
the number of births through postponed marriage

00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:00.300
or, in more extreme cases, through infanticide.
And the most desperate resorted to suicide.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.909
Now, we don't have many records of suicide
rates, but a Qing decree of 1688 forbidding

00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:08.439
widows from killing themselves suggests that
it was widespread.

00:08:08.439 --> 00:08:13.319
And speaking of widows, wars compounded the
problem by creating lots of them, like in

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:17.239
Europe, the Thirty Years War led to a rise
in the number of households headed by women.

00:08:17.239 --> 00:08:21.779
Women also took the lead in reducing the number
of mouths to feed by delaying marriage. Like,

00:08:21.779 --> 00:08:25.059
whenever bread prices rise, rates of marriage
fall.

00:08:25.059 --> 00:08:27.989
And the last thing that I'll mention here
is that bad weather and poor harvests also

00:08:27.989 --> 00:08:32.120
prompted migration. Like, in the first half
of the seventeenth century, perhaps one half

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:38.100
of all adult Scotsmen left Scotland. Many
Chinese left for the Philippines, Indonesia, and Taiwan.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:42.339
So, we have a world that's dramatically different
because of the climate change of the Little

00:08:42.339 --> 00:08:46.959
Ice Age. Women head more households, many
communities are more ethnically diverse, population

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:51.350
growth slowed dramatically, and there was
widespread political unrest and wars and starvation.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:55.180
And, of course, looking at the history of
the Little Ice Age is relevant for us today

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:59.420
as we face a change in climate and the extreme
weather that comes with it.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.690
Sometimes, we like to imagine that math and
science don't really have much to do with

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:07.329
the humanities, that, like, how we live in
the world isn't really shaped by our environment.

00:09:07.329 --> 00:09:12.400
But, of course, it is. We are shaping our
environment. Our environment is also shaping us.

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:16.730
To end on a hopeful note, the agricultural
innovations that developed in the face of

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:21.480
tremendous weather-related challenges should
remind us that it is possible to adapt to

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.600
changing climates if we make the effort and
take the time. We don't know what the cast

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.519
iron plows of the future are going to be,
but we do know that we're going to need them.

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:32.600
Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.
