00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.719
Whenever there is a list released of the world’s
most dangerous jobs, tree loggers, steelworkers,

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.280
electrical power-line installers, and fisherman
usually are the professions that populate

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.670
the list.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.270
But none of those things are nearly as dangerous
as being propelled out of a long cylinder

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.040
tube, flown through the air completely untethered,
and attempting to land safely on the ground.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.160
As you’ll soon see, when the Bureau of Labor
Statistics recently listed logging as the

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:41.430
most dangerous job in America at 127.8 deaths
per 100,000… well, let’s just say that’s

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.960
laughable compared to the death rates of the
human cannonballers.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.160
The human cannonball first entered the public
consciousness in the late 19th century.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.790
In 1871, an Englishman named George Farini
developed a mechanism he called a “projector.”

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.030
Made out of heavy springs and Indian rubber,
it was simply a platform with the springs.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.580
It looked nothing like a cannon; but when
released, it shot the person (or whatever

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.260
was on the platform) forward.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.150
He applied and a received a patent for his
contraption on June 13, 1871.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.090
Two years later, in 1873, the “projector”
made it’s first appearance to the American

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.810
public (it’s unknown when/if he showed it
to an English audience) at the well-known

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.560
Broadway theatre, Niblo’s Garden, in New
York City.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.929
Due to Farini’s own girth, he himself was
not the person who went flying into the air

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:32.929
that night.

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:37.009
Instead, “Lulu,” a petite young man dressed
in woman’s clothes who George had trained,

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:38.119
was the performer.

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.509
When George let go of the latch holding the
spring, Lulu shot thirty feet into the air

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.539
and grabbed the bars of trapeze hanging down
from the ceiling.

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:46.939
The crowd went wild.

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:54.549
George and Lulu were a hit and took to the
road with their circus act . By 1875, Lulu

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:00.490
was known as the “Queen of the Trapezists,”
but their act would be eclipsed by a new innovation

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.840
in the human projectile industry.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.729
There are conflicting accounts of who performed
the first human cannonball act- “The Australian

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.720
Marvels” Ella Zuila and George Loyal, or
14 year old Rossa Matilda Richter, also known

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.720
as “Zazel.”

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.280
According to circushistory.org, the Aussies
first began doing their act in Sydney in 1872

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.950
with George being shot out of a large cylinder
and Ella catching him as she hung from a trapeze

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:27.950
bar.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.310
Other sources claim that Zazel was the first
human cannonball when she performed the same

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.660
type of stunt in front of a live audience
at the Royal Aquarium in London in 1877.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.040
She would later be recruited and become part
of P.T.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.040
Barnum’s show.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.580
But, of course, if the dates are to be believed,
Zazzle appears to have been second, contrary

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.980
to many reports.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.460
Either way, the human cannonball thrilled
audiences.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.810
The danger, the excitement, and the bravery
grabbed the attention of everyone watching.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.270
The best circuses of the time, including PT
Barnum’s and Yankee Robinson Circus (where

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.670
Zuila and Loyal eventually performed their
act in America), saw this and knew it had

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.370
to become a staple of their show.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.760
The mechanics of shooting a human from a cannon
are actually not that complicated.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.980
In fact, the so-called “cannon” is technically
not a cannon at all.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.180
Gunpowder, commonly found in normal cannons,
has historically never been the impetus for

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.270
the human cannonball act (though sometimes,
for dramatic effect, gunpowder is used on

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.120
the outside to give it more “visual intrigue”).

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.180
Instead, compressed air or, less often, bungee
cords are used to shoot off the living projectile.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.090
Like any act, secretive performers are often
hesitant to reveal the exact science behind

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.990
their own mechanism, but the devices tend
to work more like a catapult or push sled.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.260
Quite simply, someone crawls into the barrel
and compressed air pushes the platform under

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.960
them up at a force of 3,000 to 6,000 pounds
per square inch (psi) of pressure.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.080
The platform stops at the muzzle of the cannon,
but the human inside keeps going, high into

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.080
the air.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:09.290
Traveling upwards of 70 miles per hour (the
world record is 74.6 mph or 120.057 km/hr),

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.430
these human missiles can be shot to as far
200 feet away and reach an altitude of upwards

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.430
of 75 feet.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.519
It has even been reported that human cannonballs
have been known to blackout in mid-air, due

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.310
to the extreme G-force (as much as nine times
normal gravity).

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.590
And if all of this doesn’t quite meet your
danger quota, landing is actually the most

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.340
hazardous part of being a human cannonball.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.789
Prior to launch, the stunt men and women have
already meticulously and carefully set up

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.919
nets or inflatable targets to catch them.

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:46.210
Despite these targets measuring usually around
50 by 25 feet, they still are frighteningly

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.469
small to a person flying 200 feet through
the air.

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:53.999
Before any audience members have arrived,
the crews test these targets by placing stuffed

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:58.330
dummies (the same weight as their human counterpart)
into the cannon and shoot them off to see

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.460
where they land and if the target can hold
them.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.460
They adjust accordingly.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.690
If all the tests go well, the act proceeds
as usual.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.180
If not, performers will cancel their performance.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.249
Unfortunately, it’s when the tests don’t
reveal a potential flaw or when a performer

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:17.540
doesn’t cancel despite uncertainty that
a tragedy happens.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.640
The late British historian, A.H. Coxe, once
estimated that of the 50 people who had made

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.259
human cannonballing their profession up to
that point, 30 died doing the act — most

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:29.819
due to target issues.

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:32.449
Others have been severely hurt.

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:37.520
Rossa Matilda Richter, our 14-year-old cannonball
pioneer, broke her back while working for

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.050
PT Barnum when she missed her target.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.090
On June 8, 1987, Elvin Bale, while performing
for the Barnum &amp; Bailey circus, overshot his

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.660
landing target due to the dummy they tested
being wet and, therefore, heavier.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.430
He ended up paralyzed in both legs.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.289
Others were not so lucky.

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:59.949
In front of two thousand spectators in 2011,
Matt Cranch was performing as a human cannonball

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:01.050
for the first time.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.909
He was shot into the air and had reached approximately
40 feet high, but on the way down his netting

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:07.909
collapsed.

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.749
He landed head first, dying on impact.

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:14.960
Despite the dangers, there have been plenty
of successful and famous human cannonballs.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.220
And, often, it was a family affair.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.620
The Zacchini family, usually working under
a contract with Ringling Circus, became the

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.029
name in human cannonballing for most of the
20th century.

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:30.360
Beginning in the 1920s, five of the family’s
seven brothers took to the skies and the family

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.289
would continue to perform until the 1990s.

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:38.590
Brothers Victor and Hugo developed a double-barrelled
version of their act.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.949
Brother Mario once flew over two Ferris Wheels.

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:47.159
Today, the biggest names in human cannonballing
belong to the Smith family, mainly David “Cannonball”

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:49.559
Smith and his son, David “The Bullet”
Smith Jr.

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:54.090
In fact, David Sr. held the world record for
longest human cannonball flight until May

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.129
2011 when his son broke it,

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:02.569
Hugo Zacchini, of the famous Zacchini brothers,
holds a distinction in US Supreme Court history

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:03.569
as well.

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:07.979
In 1972, Hugo was performing his act at a
county fair in Ohio when a Scripps-Howard

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:13.050
reporter filmed fifteen seconds of his act,
enough to capture nearly the entirety of the

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.280
launch and landing.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:19.039
It was shown on the evening news, but Zacchini
sued, saying that they had no right to show

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:22.939
the entirety of his act, his intellectual
property, without fairly compensating him.

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:27.389
After the Ohio Supreme Court ruled in favor
of Scripps-Howard, Zacchini took it to the

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:29.009
United States Supreme Court.

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:34.150
In 1977, the Supreme Court ruled in favor
of Zacchini five to four with the majority

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:39.850
opinion reading that Zacchini not only deserved
to be compensated for the time and effort

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:44.509
involved in his act, but the “economic incentive
for him to make the investment required to

00:07:44.509 --> 00:07:56.889
produce a performance of interest to 

00:07:56.889 --> 00:08:00.829
the public.”
