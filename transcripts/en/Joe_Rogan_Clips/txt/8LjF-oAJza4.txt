Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. So you, you guys are dealing with Brexit, right? Yeah. We've got a how's that changed the climate of England? Well, it's made, it's made a very toxic, very, I'm like, come on, like what's happening over here? You know, it's all gone polarized. Um, like with the build the wall stuff. Yeah. Yeah. And it's one side of the, other than this, no one in the middle in a way, if, if you look at succession and a, um, American civil war that was bound to happen at some time. If you go back to the constitution, um, 17, seven and 87 that was, was happening, happened. I think once you, European Union, no one's ever tried from countries that have hundreds of years of, of, uh, history, choose to try and lend to live together, work together some shape or form. This tricky thing we're trying to do. It's the hottest thing politically that's ever been done in the history of the world.

Speaker 1:          00:54          Um, and I th cause I'm saying the American muddle with native American lands and rolling over manifest destiny is a different model. It's a different way of things happen. It's a different time as well. Yeah. Different time. And native Americans didn't have this idea of, oh, we mark this off in when we've registered this land. So the idea that people are learning to work together is, um, it's tricky. At some point someone was going to say, I think we, we'd like to change this or we'd like to move out. So this fight was bound to happen. And, uh, so it's, it's very toxic. It's, I'm, I'm not getting too in right at the center of it cause you could just, you know, probably like you have a New York, um, news broadcasts, you can listen to people talking hours and hours and hours or what do you think about, what do you think about, and it doesn't seem to get anyway, so I worked out when my worldview is this view that everyone's got to have a fair chance in life.

Speaker 1:          01:53          I know the automation is happening right now. So there's going to be a whole load of, uh, people who won't be able to get jobs because of the unskilled labor force that job's going to get automated. That's going to get tricky. So the universal wage is probably going to have to come in the idea of universal basic income, universal basic income, which everyone's gonna have to get, and it's not going to be a negative thing. It's gotta be something. Okay, then you can go off and you can retrain or you can live your life. And uh, and then there's artificial intelligence parity by 2050 next 30 years. And that's what is that mean? We can't even work out what that means. Right. Um, I think it's going to get harder before it gets easier. And so I'm going to just, I always play the long game.

Speaker 1:          02:31          I always do the long game. So, you know, I came out and it back in 85 and I just thought we'll, hopefully it'll get better over time. And now this world up in 2019 and it's definitely better than that was where he can go backwards, phones back. But I just, I ain't going to try and shoot for that. And the, the, everyone has a fair chance in life and as to Brexit, where that goes when they, you know, positive, negative, you know, I'm against it so I was just going to find it. I don't need to think about whether I'm against it. I just know that I want, the younger people are coming online to vote now they're old enough to vote and they, 78% of them want to be part of Europe. And the older people who are passing away, probably 70 80% of them wanting to be out of Europe.

Speaker 1:          03:11          And it's a fear thing like immigration, fear of well is the thing you've gotta we have to be brave and curious rather than fearful and suspicious. And these are the two ways I think people can go. If we're brave enough, we can be curious and say, hi, how are you? Where are you from and what do you do? Can we learn for you? Can you learn from us? I think that is the way for humanity to go forward. Or You could be fearful and suspicious, what? Hang on, they'll back off outside. Don't, I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to know about you. And that's the fearful and suspicious way. And um, I think we have to be brave and curious, otherwise we're not going to make it. So for us in America, what you're essentially dealing with a bunch of different countries that speak a bunch of different languages, whereas we're dealing with a bunch of different states that speak the same language, but it's kind of doesn't make any difference.

Speaker 1:          03:57          Yeah. It's interesting because I thought if everyone could get the hang, because English has become a Lingua Franca for the world, hasn't made much difference. And as America shows, you can be completely at loggerheads, whether you're saying the same words or not. I think if you're not saying the same words, it's easier for people to say, who are these people? We hate them because they can't understand a single word. They're saying that's easier. But yeah, it's an easier way to be xenophobic slash racist on it. And I've always said the xenophobia is just a racist, where the xylophone check, which I got to somewhere to political situation. Um, but
