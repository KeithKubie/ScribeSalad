00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Okay, so for your first homework, what I'd like you to do is get a basic web app online.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is going to be the foundation for what we're doing in the rest of this class.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So step 1 will be install Google App Engine.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We'll include documentation in the course notes for how to do this,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and you can also use Google's own instructions online.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And we want to install the Python version.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Put online a basic app. All it has to do is print out the words, "Hello, Udacity!"

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Nothing fancy.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Just basically get this thing online, and when you've got that working,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
submit the URL here.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'll show you what it looks like on my browser, or my version of it.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Here we are. This is what I've installed.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
You can see it's running on appspot.com, which is Google App Engine's domain by default.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
All it does is has a simple webpage that prints out, Hello, Udacity!

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This is the entire homework. If you get this working, you have succeeded.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
For some of you, this should only take 15 minutes or so,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
but I realize that installing web apps and packages and things like this

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
can sometimes be troublesome.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So once we've got this working, we'll have a good foundation to build on

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
for the rest of the course. Okay, good luck!
