Did I notice a little,
like, spark

00:00:08.774 --> 00:00:10.309 size:59% position:70%
between you
and Miss Cheri?

00:00:10.342 --> 00:00:12.078
-You saw that, too?
-Yeah.

00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:13.746 size:78% position:39% line:78%
I totally felt something.

I think there was something
between you two.

When we go back in
to give the verdict,

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:18.117 align:end position:100%
see if you can get some --
like, try to wink at her.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.219 align:start position:0%
I can't. I am physically
incapable of winking.

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:21.687 align:start size:50% position:50%
Try winking.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.688 align:start size:88% position:13%
I have to...

[ Laughs ]

00:00:24.223 --> 00:00:25.925 size:69% position:34%
I could shut them both

[ Coughs ]
I mean, did you see

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:38.604 size:75% position:63%
how mad the daughter was
at the mother

00:00:38.637 --> 00:00:41.140 size:78% position:61%
for just going out
and taking out that loan?

00:00:41.173 --> 00:00:43.042 size:63% position:31%
Yeah, payday loans
should just be

00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:45.845 size:66% position:33%
for, like,
a ransom situation.

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:48.381
That's the only time you should
ever go to a payday loan place.

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:49.682 size:72% position:64%
What did you write down
in there?

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:51.150 align:start size:63% position:38%
What are your notes?

00:00:51.183 --> 00:00:53.319
This says "Costco," and I just
underlined it a couple times.

[ Laughs ]

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.022 align:start position:0%
'Cause I like Costco,

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:57.290 size:63% position:31%
and I could go
to Costco right now.

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:59.325 size:72% position:64%
So that's your solution
to their problem

00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:01.494 size:63% position:69%
is just you'll
drive her to Costco?

00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:04.163 align:start position:0%
I could take Miss Cheri
to Costco occasionally.

Try winking.

00:01:11.303 --> 00:01:14.974 align:end position:100%
See if maybe, like,
in the moment, you can wink.

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:18.144 size:75% position:38% line:78%
Oh, you think because --

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:18.144 size:66% position:67%
Try winking at her
when we get in there.

00:01:18.177 --> 00:01:21.547 align:end position:100%
Just 'cause I want to see you
double blink at her.

-When?

When you -- Past tense.
Like, if I were to wink.

-"Wunk" is never a word.
-"Wunk"?

00:01:28.053 --> 00:01:30.022
-"Wunk" is never --
-So it's "winked."

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:31.691 size:63% position:31%
Also, when would you
ever tell a story

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.159
where you winked in the past?

00:01:33.192 --> 00:01:35.094 align:end position:100%
Let me tell you a story
where someone winked at me.

00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:36.362 align:start size:84% position:16%
Yeah, okay.
