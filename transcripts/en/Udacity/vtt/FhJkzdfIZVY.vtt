00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.090
Here's my decimal. I know I need to move it to the left side of 1, so I have to

00:00:04.102 --> 00:00:08.207
move it this way. My decimal definitely moves left. Let's make sure it keeps

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:12.179
going. Now that I have it on the other side of 1, on the left side of 1, I can

00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:16.580
move the decimal again. When I move the decimal to the left, I create a 0 in

00:00:16.592 --> 00:00:21.345
that place value. So I move from tenths to hundredths. And here, when I move the

00:00:21.357 --> 00:00:25.878
decimal again, I'm going to go from hundredths to thousandths. When I move the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.354
decimal left, I create a 0 for a place holder, and I move from hundredths to

00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.509
thousandths. Nice work on that quiz.
