00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.389
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:02.780
You're ready, boss.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.120
ROSS BEYER: All right,
my name's Ross Beyer.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.120
I'm with the Carl Sagan Center
at the SETI Institute and NASA

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.470
Ames Research Center.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.145
You'll notice my name at the end
of the author list there

00:00:10.145 --> 00:00:11.560
instead of the beginning.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.120
And NASA has a large amount of
geospatial data, not only of

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.980
the Earth, but, of course, of
many of the other planets in

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.130
our solar system.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.470
And this talk is going to be
about how to visualize some of

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.230
that data for Mars and the
moon in Google Earth.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.930
In fact, you can do
that right now.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.080
You may not know, but the--

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.119
this little button here, this
Saturn-shaped button, it used

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.964
to be the switch to sky.

00:00:32.964 --> 00:00:36.020
It's actually now a drop-down
menu, and you can also go to

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.760
Mars and the moon with it.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.090
So let's do that.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.230
So this is Mars.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.375
And the first thing you see
come up when you switch to

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:48.110
Mars mode is this butterscotch
planet.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.570
And if you zoom in, the data
comes from a couple of

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.660
different sources.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.646
And this slide kind of
shows all of them

00:00:53.646 --> 00:00:55.820
and also looks pretty.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.430
This kind of low-resolution
imagery and topography here on

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.030
the left is actually the--

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.120
imagery is from the Viking
spacecraft from the '70s, the

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.270
color imagery from Viking.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.280
And the topography there is from
a lower-resolution global

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.250
topography data set.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.020
This kind of patch here on the
right, both imagery and

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.180
topography, is from a camera
called the high-resolution

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.530
stereo camera on board the
European Space Agency's Mars

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.600
Express spacecraft.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.880
And that topography is much
better as is the color data,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.160
although it's not completely
perfect.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.720
Because as you can see here
where my pointer is, there's

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.140
kind of this band where the
pushbroom sensor kind of stuck

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.620
a little bit.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.170
And so you'll see these little
errors from time to time.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.190
They're not NASA-- or covering
anything up.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.610
It's just sometimes
data goes bad.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.750
But in addition to what you see
to begin with, there are a

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.120
number of other basemaps
that you can browse.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.310
Of course, there's the complete
Viking global data

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.460
set there in upper left from the
'70s, the global colorized

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.680
Mars orbital laser altimeter
data set that we use for

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.810
topography.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.760
It has a pleasing rainbow color
shade that you can look

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.370
at, if you like that
sort of thing.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:13.480
On the right are two kinds of
data from an infrared camera

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.680
at Mars that's gotten a global
data set, both daytime and

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.750
nighttime infrared data, and a
host of others that you can

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.320
see there in the Global Maps
pane in the Layers menu.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.950
In addition to just maps that
are wrapped around the planet,

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.630
there's also of variety of
spacecraft imagery that's been

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.870
taken of Mars.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.980
And this has a couple of
those layers turned on.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.850
But basically, all those little
polygons and placemarks

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.190
is a spot where an orbital
imager has taken some kind of

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.290
data of Mars.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.170
The yellow squares, yellow
plug-ins are from the Mars

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.390
orbital camera on the Mars
Surveyor spacecraft that

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.600
started operating in '98 and
has now since been lost.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.270
The red polygons are from the
HiRISE on MRO and the blue

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.890
hourglass-shaped are from CRISM,
an infrared mapping

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:02.940
spectrometer.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.020
In addition to just these
polygons and outlines, each

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.770
one of those placemarks links to
the full data for each one

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.570
of those images out
to the various

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.450
data providers websites.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.685
And some HiRISE images are also
embedded into the global

00:03:16.685 --> 00:03:20.550
layer, as we'll see
in a moment.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.290
Here's one of them.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.340
This is actually the area where
the Mars Exploration

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.090
Rover Spirit is currently
driving around.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.920
And this perspective view
a HiRISE image.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.420
HiRISE images are collected
at about a quarter

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.970
of a meter per pixel.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.040
And we can build terrain out of
stereo pairs of this data.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.340
And so the posting on this
particular trend is about one

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.230
meter per pixel.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.610
And you can see that
Spirit started out.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.500
It landed over there, and it
drove across the plains, and

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.880
towards Husband Hill, and drove
up one side and down the

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.320
other, and is now currently
exploring this area called

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.460
Home Plate.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.210
That's the traversed
path in red.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.390
But the little camera icons
are where the rover has

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.410
stopped to take color
panoramas.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.770
Now, here's another view of that
with a colored panorama

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.350
there floating in space above
where the spot was where the

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.440
rover took it.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.070
And, of course, you can zoom
into those just like you can

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.769
with Street View on the Earth
and explore all of these

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.890
images down to the individual
rocks and pieces of dust and

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.550
pebbles that the rovers
have seen.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.300
To give you an idea, this is a
perspective view in the client

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.490
again of the topography
from the HiRISE

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.720
camera in Google Earth.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.890
So this is imagery and terrain
created by a stereo camera

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.680
about 400 kilometers up.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.240
And if we then bring in the--

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.985
I'm going to fade in
the actual panorama

00:04:40.985 --> 00:04:42.370
that the rover took.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.300
You can see that we did
a pretty good job.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.920
And you can experiment
with that yourself.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.975
You can explore any panorama
or any layer, of course, in

00:04:51.975 --> 00:04:52.540
Google Earth.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.850
There's the little known alpha
slider up here, just above the

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.290
Layers panel and you can change
the opacity of layers.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.605
So that's always fun to do, to
get things to show up and see

00:05:02.605 --> 00:05:03.855
how they line up.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.100
One of the other things we do
with Mars is we have a feature

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.570
called Live from Mars.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.740
There are two spacecraft.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.370
Well, there are several
spacecraft, but two of the

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.250
spacecraft are on
Mars right now--

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.530
Mars Odyssey and Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter--

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.010
providing us with
near-real-time

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.780
telemetry data from them.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.840
And so this is the THEMIS data
from the Odyssey spacecraft.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.670
It may be difficult to see on
your display, but there's a

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.210
little white line here.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.230
The time slider is--

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.720
this line represents the
spacecraft's orbit.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.900
This purple fin indicates when
this particular camera started

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.160
taking an image and when it
stopped taking an image.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.420
And you can see purple
rectangles with images here on

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.590
the planet as well.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.610
And those actually contains
data that's

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.000
only a few weeks old.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.620
And so at any given time in Live
from Mars, the total data

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.490
is maybe about a week old
and has about two

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.040
weeks span of data.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.140
So you can see what these
spacecraft were doing just a

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.390
few weeks ago.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.100
Let's go to our more near
neighbor, the moon, which was

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.410
just launched this summer.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:12.320
In the moon data, the global
default data here is a

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.460
Clementine data set from
the late '90s.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.560
And in fact, this patch right
here, this kind of strip, is a

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.950
reconstruction from Apollo
Metric Camera data.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.690
Of course, while the Apollo
astronauts were on the surface

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.840
walking around, the poor
gentleman who had to run the

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.390
command module, whose name
people rarely remember, is

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.690
busy taking orbital photographs
of the moon.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.550
And so this stitch of
data comes from the

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:37.560
Apollo Metric Camera.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.690
And not only is that good
imagery at a few tens of

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.360
meters per pixel, but it also
allows us to build a stereo

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.550
model of that one strip at a
very high resolution, for the

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.440
moon anyway.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.240
This image over here on the top
right is the bad global

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.210
topography.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.830
I won't say anymore about it
other than that we have a

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.100
spacecraft around the moon right
now called the Lunar

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.753
Reconnaissance Orbiter that's
doing a much better job and

00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:02.250
creating a much more
dense data set.

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.250
The two maps on the bottom--

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.720
on the left is a geomorphic map;
on the right is an old

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.230
topographic map--

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:12.580
are actually scans of individual
USGS products.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.990
So back in the day, USGS would
make geomorphic maps and

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.630
topography charts.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.730
And the Lunar and Planetary
Institute in Houston has

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:24.000
lovingly scanned these physical
maps, and we took

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.440
those scans and wrapped
them around the globe.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.500
And you can actually
explore them.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.325
Here you can see these
big tiles.

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:32.160
And as you mouse over the
globe when you have this

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.270
historic map up, you can see
that there's a red extruded

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.250
polygon there.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.410
And if you click on it, it
actually brings up a photo

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.360
overlay of the poster.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.700
And so that actually--

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.080
you can zoom all the way in and
read the text and get a

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.820
very good example of what the
physical object was like that

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:51.090
was scanned.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:54.100
And of course, these are
giant posters that are

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:54.880
folded out, et cetera.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:55.960
And few people have them.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.640
Or the people that do, of
course, have giant drawers

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.060
full of them.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:03.040
But it's a great way to explore
that historical data.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.960
No moon would be complete
without

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.150
places where we stopped.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.620
Here is a view of Apollo
11 in Google Earth, the

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.660
landing site here.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:16.400
The image on the ground there
is an old chart actually

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.650
hand-airbrushed.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.230
And, of course, we
put in the Apollo

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.180
model in various places.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.740
Again, you can see little
panoramas floating ghostly

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.030
over the surface.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:29.480
You may not be able to see
little YouTube icons.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.725
They're a video that had been
recorded by the astronauts

00:08:31.725 --> 00:08:33.210
when they were there that's been
uploaded to YouTube that

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:33.960
you can explore.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.320
And in fact, all these little
placemarks record a spot where

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.169
the astronauts stopped and did
something in their traverse

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:42.270
through the area.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.210
So you can kind of follow these
in order, or you can

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.650
sample them on your own.

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.540
The other site-- well, actually
we have all the

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.420
sites, but the other example we
have is here of Apollo 15.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.750
Apollo 15, this is zoomed much
more out because Apollo 15 had

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.230
one of their little
moon buggies,

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:58.120
and they drove around.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.850
So this kind of shows
the three trips out.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.510
And again, there are panoramas
and movies

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:04.700
that you can explore.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.825
And this has this beautiful 3D
topography from the Apollo

00:09:07.825 --> 00:09:12.560
Metric Camera and the panoramic
imagery from USGS.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.570
So, what would we do next?

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.150
Now, let me also state that
everything we that we did in

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:21.910
Google Mars and Google Moon,
with the exception of

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.500
terrains, because of course,
you can't load in your own

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.790
user-generated terrain.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:28.370
But all of that other stuff is
all done in KML, implemented

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:32.200
that way, and any of that
can be built for your

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.720
own purposes or needs.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.770
There's nothing special done.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:38.835
We haven't hacked the client,
except for enabling a moon and

00:09:38.835 --> 00:09:40.280
a Mars and their terrain.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.360
But other than that, all
very standard KML.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.850
It's how we delivered it
from Ames to Google.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.290
So what next for this
collaboration

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:50.135
between Ames and Google?

00:09:50.135 --> 00:09:53.360
And there's not really enough
data at this time to support

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.800
another full planet from
anywhere else in the solar

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.210
system at the resolution that
Google Earth can provide.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:03.220
But what we're trying to do now
is to implement more data

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.370
linkages between NASA's
data providers.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:10.930
So for example, as I showed you
those rover tracks, those

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:12.350
rover tracks is where
the rovers were

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:13.350
about six months ago.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.290
The rovers are on the ground
and still moving.

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:16.450
And that needs to be updated.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.150
Right now to update that, we
have to do a bunch of manual

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:23.310
processes to upload the data and
to make those things more

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.190
contemporary.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.920
And so we're working
with trying to--

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.750
rather than having us do it
every time there's a data

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.970
change, because we're talking
about a lot of data here

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.110
sometimes, is to try and get the
data providers themselves

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.200
to publish that data in
a format that's easily

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.520
consumable by us and easily
displayable on Google Earth.
