00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.210
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.080
and welcome to The
Developer Show.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.630
I'm standing here with Kathy
Pham who has a very long title.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.713
I'm going to get it right.

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:27.600
It's Health Data Adviser
and Product Manager

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.287
at the US Digital Service.

00:00:29.287 --> 00:00:30.120
Welcome to the show.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.730
KATHY PHAM: Thank you.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.070
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Let's talk
about the US Digital Service,

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.230
and let's do it as engineers do.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.970
What's the problem statement?

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.020
KATHY PHAM: So the
problem statement

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.760
is to solve the technology
problems that face

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.770
the federal government today.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.180
It's all revolved
around thinking of a way

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.250
to use technology, or
changing the technology that's

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.744
in place, to make services
better for the American people.

00:00:53.744 --> 00:00:55.160
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
The way I've heard

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.166
you describe it before and,
sort of, seen it online

00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.040
is it's like a startup
within the government.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.711
KATHY PHAM: Yep.

00:01:00.711 --> 00:01:02.460
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
it's such a cool idea.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.501
KATHY PHAM: It's amazing.

00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:06.429
It's been known as the
President's tech startup,

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:08.720
so it's great that we had
the backing of the President.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.940
And it's very much a startup
inside the government.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.064
We've had to build our
entire hiring pipeline,

00:01:13.064 --> 00:01:14.480
figure out our
mission, figure out

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.410
what projects we're going
to work on, prioritize.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.764
And yeah, it's very much
a little tech startup,

00:01:19.764 --> 00:01:21.680
just like you'd have out
here in the Bay Area,

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.712
inside government.

00:01:22.712 --> 00:01:24.420
TIMOTHY JORDAN: If
you achieve everything

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.000
you want to over the
next, say, two years,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.550
how does the government look
different for everyday people?

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.480
KATHY PHAM: It shouldn't
matter to you that we're

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.034
25 different agencies.

00:01:32.034 --> 00:01:34.200
You should just have a
seamless, awesome experience.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.520
What that would mean is that
you have delightful experiences

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.040
when you want to bring a
family member into the US.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.820
It is easy to find information,
and you can figure out really

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.387
quickly if you were to help
a sibling or a child figure

00:01:49.387 --> 00:01:51.720
out what university in your
area and what field of study

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.970
to go to so that they have
the best chance of success.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.760
And it means that
our vets can get

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.350
the care they need
when they need it,

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.530
and they're not waiting
two years to get basic care

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.090
or to get mental health help
or to get any of the services

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.420
that they absolutely deserve.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.780
And some of that is much
bigger than a tech problem.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.290
Some of it's underlying,
other underlying issues,

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.304
but we'll fix what we can at the
tech level to get them there.

00:02:16.304 --> 00:02:17.970
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I
read your Medium post,

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.145
and I was really touched
about your relationship

00:02:20.145 --> 00:02:21.520
with your brother
and your mother

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.260
and the United
States of America.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.100
And I wanted to ask you, how did
all those things come together

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.796
at just the right time to
drive you into this service?

00:02:29.796 --> 00:02:32.170
KATHY PHAM: I worked on Google
Health for a little while.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.450
I built data warehouses for
hospitals, and did this work,

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.805
and still was enjoying
my time, and was

00:02:37.805 --> 00:02:39.180
kind of going
along in my career,

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.920
didn't really know
where that would go,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.560
and got a call from
Mikey Dickerson one day.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.440
He was one of the
integral people

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.030
in the healthcare.gov
team that turned

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.430
around the
healthcare.gov website

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.669
when it was basically
unusable back in 2013.

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:52.710
It was all over the news.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.280
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I remember that.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.655
KATHY PHAM: And
it became stable.

00:02:54.655 --> 00:02:56.684
And so he gave me a
call and was like,

00:02:56.684 --> 00:02:58.600
I need someone who knows
health care and data.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.240
Can you come help?

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.050
And here I am today,
taking everything

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.540
that I've accumulated,
whether it's

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.350
the experience I saw from
my mom, the experience I had

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.830
in computer science and software
engineering, the empathy

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.270
that I have for my little
brother, all of that

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.882
has really contributed to this
role here in the United States

00:03:17.882 --> 00:03:19.340
Federal Government,
which is, like,

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.632
the biggest public service
project you can possibly do.

00:03:21.632 --> 00:03:24.298
TIMOTHY JORDAN: If you'd like to
learn more about the US Digital

00:03:24.298 --> 00:03:26.940
Service, check out their website
and the Medium publication,

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.070
both linked below.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.694
Is there anything
else that they should

00:03:29.694 --> 00:03:31.870
do if they want to get,
say, even more involved?

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.536
KATHY PHAM: Yes.

00:03:32.536 --> 00:03:35.560
So one way to get involved
is to apply directly

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.970
at the whitehouse.gov/usds
or 18f.gov,

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.440
or look into the Presidential
Innovation Fellows program,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.360
where we bring some of the best
entrepreneurs in the country

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.430
into government
to solve problems.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.900
Or join a local government,
look into Code for America

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.410
where Fellows are deployed
across the country

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.080
to solve their
local governments.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.746
Or better yet, if you
want to keep your day job,

00:03:56.746 --> 00:03:58.620
contribute to any of
the open source projects

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.390
that we have because
that's a thing now.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.557
We have our code out
on GitHub for many

00:04:02.557 --> 00:04:03.640
of the different projects.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.237
You can go and contribute
to that code base

00:04:06.237 --> 00:04:08.570
and have your code become
part of the federal government

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.300
and contribute to
making America better.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.960
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.250
Thanks for joining
me today, Kathy.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.480
KATHY PHAM: Yeah, thank you.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.690
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
