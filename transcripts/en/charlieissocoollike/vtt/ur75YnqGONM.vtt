00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.710
I had a really good day recently.
Is it an interesting story?

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.140
This is the story of how I almost
threw up in front of David Mitchell. 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.400
Sounds interesting.
Sounds like it's gonna be interesting.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.930
Probably would be more interesting if
I actually threw up in front of David Mitchell. 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.570
I'm very please that
that didn't happen, though. 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.820
I guess, for me, it's one
of those momemnts 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.350
that tests whether or not I'm
making decisions in my life 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.530
because I want to or because I think
that they will make good videos, 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.060
and in this case, I thought, 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.880
"You know what? I'm gonna
take one for the team and uhh--" 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.110
No, I'm gonna take one
for me, not for the team. 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.720
Screw the team. 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.720
So I mean the whole story basically is
I went on a walk with David Mitchell. 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.640
He's a comedian.
He's a nice guy as well. 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.410
My friend, Ken,
introduced me to him.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.190
He said, "Oh, I'm going on a walking tour
of London with David Mitchell--" 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.010
I don't know why
he speaks like that. 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.910
He doesn't speak like that.
He's American. 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.060
He speaks like this... Now I have
to do a good impression of him. 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.740
(ATTEMTED AMERICAN ACCTENT)
"Charlie, I'm going on a walking tour 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.230
of London, the City of London." 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.240
He does actually sound quite like that.
I'm pretty impressed. 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.610
(ATTEMTED AMERICAN ACCTENT)
I'm going on a walking tour of 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.190
the City of London
with David Mitchell, 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.800
which you're welcome to come
along to if you do so desire. 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.890
Paraphrasing, obivously. 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.960
A part of me was like, "Ahh, I don't know.
I don't want to be mooching off your friendship 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.480
'cause Ken knows quite a lot of cool
people, but I, you know, I gave in. 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.860
I thought, "Yes, I will come." 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.760
And he was very nice about it,
but the problem I have is 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.970
I have a very weak stomach,

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.690
a very bad digestive system. 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.390
Just the act of eating and walking
makes me want to throw up. 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.310
I had lunch with Ken, went
on a walking tour of London 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.080
with Ken and David Mitchell, spent
the whole thing wanting to throw up, 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.310
we went to a pub afterwards. 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.570
David offered to buy me a
drink at the pub and I said, 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.450
"Can I have a water
'cause I feel quite ill." 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.320
And he said,"Oh I didn't
know you were feeling ill." 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.790
I made him feel bad about
the fact that I was feeling ill 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.810
becasue I didn't tell him 'casue
I was too embarrassed. 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.580
And then they both went
to go and sit down. 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.460
And I was like, "Yep, I'm
gonna go to the toilet now." 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.800
I sat on the toilet
for a little while. 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.300
I got off the toilet
and I threw up into it.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.420
I looked at myself
in the mirror. 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.400
I looked like someone who had
just thrown up, but I thought, 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.270
"Well, that's just who I am today.
I'm the boy who threw up." 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.980
And when, you know, I went to say
hello to them I you know, I said, 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.640
"Yes, I feel a lot better now." 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.860
I didn't way "Hey guys,
I just threw up!" 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.740
I just let them fill in
the gaps themselves. 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.170
This is how they find out. 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.410
David, now you
know as well. 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.040
I almost threw up on you. 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.160
I was very, very close, but I held
it in, and aren't I a great guy,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.500
and to proove this whole story,
here's a photo of me with David Mitchell 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.070
in a pub with lots of
ties on the celing. 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.240
I didn't even notice the
ties until I saw that photo. 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.650
No idea what the
hell that is. 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.050
If you want to
retrace the steps, 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.900
it was a pub called The Ship or
maybe just Ship? Ship the Pub. 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.740
Go there and imagine-- maybe
I should do like an audio tour guide 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.910
so you can do the same
walking tour that we did 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.040
but with my internal monologue
going on and on about 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.320
"Oh my God, I feel so sick,"
and I frequently sat-- 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.770
It was a great tour.
He's a very interseting man. 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.540
He taught me a lot.
And um...yeah. 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.330
Anictote.
You're welcome. 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.600
STEPHEN FRY VOICE: You've just had the almost
imponderable joy of watching charlieissocoollike,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.650
which makes you, like, cool

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.240
CHARLIE VOICE: By the way,
just in case you missed it.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.710
Ahh, it's one of these, isn't it? 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.600
Good. Go and do it 'casue, you know,
not many people saw this, 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.720
so that's the way of
it sometimes, isn't it? 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.650
It's the trailer for
my new short film. 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.490
Click on the thing or don't. 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.120
I mean I'd like it if you did 'cause
I'm proud of it, but um...yeah. 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.367
Alright, that's that done.
