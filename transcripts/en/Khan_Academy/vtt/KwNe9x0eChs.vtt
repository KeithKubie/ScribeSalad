00:00:00.132 --> 00:00:01.757
- [Voiceover] What I want
to do in this video is talk

00:00:01.757 --> 00:00:05.885
about the processes that
make all life as we know it,

00:00:05.885 --> 00:00:07.373
life as we know it,

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:10.868
and at it's essence, we
can call this metabolism.

00:00:12.076 --> 00:00:13.561
Metabolism.

00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:16.603
And this is the taking
energy in different forms,

00:00:16.603 --> 00:00:19.436
breaking it down into its
more fundamental components,

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:22.678
and then building it up in
ways that we would find useful,

00:00:22.678 --> 00:00:25.050
useful for energy, useful for structure,

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.006
so that we can actually live our lives,

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:29.751
we can grow, we can reproduce,

00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:32.802
we can respond to our surroundings.

00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:34.661
So as I just said, metabolism,

00:00:34.661 --> 00:00:36.962
and we're gonna go into a
bunch of examples of this.

00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:41.161
Metabolism at it's heart is
really two different processes.

00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:44.582
There's the breaking
down of the substances

00:00:44.582 --> 00:00:46.248
for energy or for
structure to getting back

00:00:46.248 --> 00:00:47.704
to the building blocks,

00:00:47.704 --> 00:00:50.186
and we call that catabolism.

00:00:50.593 --> 00:00:52.409
Catabolism.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.473
So this is the breaking down of things

00:00:55.473 --> 00:00:57.490
and then once we've broken down things,

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.215
we're ready to rebuild them in ways

00:00:59.215 --> 00:01:01.070
that we would find useful,

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.031
and we call this anabolism.

00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:06.996
Anabolism or anabolism.

00:01:07.992 --> 00:01:11.094
Anabolism, just like that.

00:01:11.094 --> 00:01:12.485
And one way to think about it is

00:01:12.485 --> 00:01:16.405
imagine that someone had
built something with Legos

00:01:16.405 --> 00:01:18.644
and you want to build
something with Legos.

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:20.331
Well you could go to those Legos

00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:21.968
and you'd want to break it down,

00:01:21.968 --> 00:01:23.142
but not break it down too much.

00:01:23.142 --> 00:01:24.260
You wouldn't melt the plastic.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.658
You would break it down into
the individual Lego pieces

00:01:26.658 --> 00:01:28.409
and then you would build it back up

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.211
into whatever shape that
you actually cared about.

00:01:31.211 --> 00:01:33.385
And you might not actually
have to even break it down

00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:35.178
all the way to the basic Lego pieces.

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:38.414
There might be structures
in that first Lego castle

00:01:38.414 --> 00:01:41.602
that was constructed that
you might find useful.

00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:44.642
So let's just think about
how all of this gets started.

00:01:44.642 --> 00:01:48.934
And what's exciting is that
all of this got started,

00:01:48.934 --> 00:01:53.657
or gets started, from stars,
from fusion reactions in stars.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.766
And this right over here
is a picture of a star,

00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:59.227
and a star that we are very familiar with.

00:01:59.227 --> 00:02:00.896
This is the sun.

00:02:00.896 --> 00:02:03.289
But you may or may not
realize that the sun

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.324
is only one of probably several stars

00:02:06.324 --> 00:02:08.539
that have been involved
in life as we know it.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.423
The sun is our most
direct source of energy

00:02:11.423 --> 00:02:12.901
for most of life as we know it.

00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:14.709
There are some bacteria

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.624
and things that are able
to live off of vents

00:02:16.624 --> 00:02:19.580
at the bottom of the ocean
because of the heat created,

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.373
but the sun is our
primary source of energy.

00:02:22.373 --> 00:02:25.168
But when I say that other
stars might have been involved,

00:02:25.168 --> 00:02:28.243
including dead stars that
existed billions of years ago,

00:02:28.243 --> 00:02:31.085
it's because the heavier
elements that we're composed of,

00:02:31.085 --> 00:02:33.267
or that are around us in the environment,

00:02:33.267 --> 00:02:35.919
the carbon, the oxygen,
we could just keep going,

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:37.924
pretty much everything
other than hydrogen,

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:41.346
it was constructed in fusion
reactions from hydrogen

00:02:41.346 --> 00:02:43.403
inside of stars.

00:02:43.403 --> 00:02:47.762
So we really are made up
of the remnants of stars.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.585
And so here we are, we're on Earth.

00:02:50.585 --> 00:02:52.992
Earth is all this condensed matter

00:02:52.992 --> 00:02:54.891
from four and a half billion years ago.

00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:57.649
Probably some nearby
supernova got all of this dust

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:59.355
that was constructed in a previous star

00:02:59.355 --> 00:03:03.501
to coalesce in that way,
and you have radiation.

00:03:03.798 --> 00:03:05.187
You have energy from the sun.

00:03:05.187 --> 00:03:07.930
And once again, that energy's
coming from fusion reactions,

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.993
and it's what fusing lighter
elements into heavier elements,

00:03:10.993 --> 00:03:14.253
so the sun is also constructing
more heavy elements,

00:03:14.253 --> 00:03:15.536
but that energy,

00:03:15.536 --> 00:03:18.194
that energy makes its way to the Earth.

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.363
And you have organisms,

00:03:21.363 --> 00:03:24.908
like plants, that are
able to use that energy

00:03:24.908 --> 00:03:28.035
to construct the material,

00:03:28.035 --> 00:03:30.147
the food, we could say,

00:03:30.147 --> 00:03:32.745
that is eventually going
to get around to us.

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:35.686
And so this process you may or
may not be familiar with it,

00:03:35.686 --> 00:03:37.474
this is photosynthesis.

00:03:37.474 --> 00:03:39.689
And we're going to go
into a lot more detail.

00:03:40.174 --> 00:03:41.823
Synthesis.

00:03:41.823 --> 00:03:44.781
And as the word implies,
photo, it's photosynthesis,

00:03:44.781 --> 00:03:46.923
it's making things out of light,

00:03:46.923 --> 00:03:48.358
and one thing I like to ask people

00:03:48.358 --> 00:03:50.312
when they are first
exposed to photosynthesis,

00:03:50.312 --> 00:03:51.995
is like okay, we can
see this grass growing

00:03:51.995 --> 00:03:53.283
or we can see this wheat growing,

00:03:53.283 --> 00:03:54.902
or we can see a tree growing,

00:03:54.902 --> 00:03:57.210
but where is that material coming from?

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.728
And the most common answer is like,

00:03:58.728 --> 00:04:00.342
"Oh, somehow it's coming from the ground,"

00:04:00.342 --> 00:04:03.146
and there are some nutrients
that are coming from the ground

00:04:03.146 --> 00:04:05.492
but it's really all about fixing carbon,

00:04:05.492 --> 00:04:07.054
and you're going to hear about this a lot

00:04:07.054 --> 00:04:09.665
especially as we talk
about the carbon cycle.

00:04:09.665 --> 00:04:13.244
But you have carbon dioxide
primarily in the air,

00:04:13.244 --> 00:04:14.932
so you have carbon,

00:04:15.274 --> 00:04:17.142
you have, I'll just write it this way.

00:04:17.142 --> 00:04:19.483
So you have carbon dioxide in the air

00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:23.908
and what photosynthesis
allows these plants to do

00:04:24.193 --> 00:04:26.954
is take the carbon in that carbon dioxide

00:04:26.954 --> 00:04:28.402
and form bonds with it,

00:04:28.402 --> 00:04:31.426
turn it from its gas
form into solid forms,

00:04:31.426 --> 00:04:34.736
into glucose molecules,
and then use that glucose

00:04:34.736 --> 00:04:38.759
to build up cellulose and to
build out other forms of starch

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.228
and whatever else it might be.

00:04:40.228 --> 00:04:42.549
So it's taking these
molecules in the air...

00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:44.508
I'll just draw them as these little...

00:04:44.852 --> 00:04:46.555
It's taking these molecules

00:04:46.555 --> 00:04:48.103
that are in the air,

00:04:48.103 --> 00:04:51.399
and it's using the energy
of the sun to fix them,

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:54.831
to actually form bonds

00:04:54.831 --> 00:04:57.307
between the carbons and with other things.

00:04:57.307 --> 00:04:58.936
As we said, we're mostly
carbon and hydrogen

00:04:58.936 --> 00:05:00.451
and we have some oxygen in there,

00:05:00.451 --> 00:05:03.603
but we're able to form these structures.

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:05.883
Now from there other living organisms,

00:05:05.883 --> 00:05:07.563
and this is a huge oversimplification,

00:05:07.563 --> 00:05:08.723
it could involve bacteria,

00:05:08.723 --> 00:05:10.288
it could involve all sorts of things.

00:05:10.288 --> 00:05:13.174
And just a reminder, you
know, that photosynthesis,

00:05:13.174 --> 00:05:16.777
it isn't just light and it
isn't just the carbon dioxide.

00:05:16.777 --> 00:05:19.840
It also involves the water
and we talk about that.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.403
So you also have water involved.

00:05:22.918 --> 00:05:24.909
You also have the water involved.

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:26.821
So you have the carbon dioxide,

00:05:26.821 --> 00:05:30.501
so CO2, light from the sun, and water.

00:05:30.501 --> 00:05:34.436
These things are able to grow
and nutrients from the Earth.

00:05:34.436 --> 00:05:38.407
And then from that, you're
able to construct things like,

00:05:38.657 --> 00:05:40.514
well, you can directly go to these plants

00:05:40.514 --> 00:05:41.928
that are taking energy from the sun

00:05:41.928 --> 00:05:44.813
and construct things like bread

00:05:44.813 --> 00:05:47.708
or you have other animals
that will eat things

00:05:47.708 --> 00:05:51.038
like the grass, and then break them down

00:05:51.038 --> 00:05:54.351
in their own way and they
will be assisted by bacteria

00:05:54.351 --> 00:05:56.053
and then rebuild themselves up

00:05:56.053 --> 00:05:59.199
into a cow, into milk.

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:00.912
And so what this cow is doing,

00:06:00.912 --> 00:06:03.187
it's metabolizing this grass.

00:06:03.187 --> 00:06:05.890
It's able to break it down, it's able to

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.237
catabolize the various molecules

00:06:10.237 --> 00:06:12.529
in the grass and break them
down into building blocks

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:15.205
that can then used to build up the cow,

00:06:15.205 --> 00:06:17.604
to build up milk, and whatever else.

00:06:17.604 --> 00:06:20.603
And you might be saying, "What
are these types of molecules

00:06:20.603 --> 00:06:23.122
"that we keep breaking down

00:06:23.122 --> 00:06:25.056
"and then building back up?"

00:06:25.056 --> 00:06:27.339
Well, you have carbohydrates.

00:06:28.271 --> 00:06:29.941
Carbohydrates,

00:06:29.941 --> 00:06:31.275
and you're going to see
most of the molecules

00:06:31.275 --> 00:06:32.622
that I'm about to talk about.

00:06:32.622 --> 00:06:34.888
Frankly, all of them on the
back of nutritional package

00:06:34.888 --> 00:06:36.671
because it tells you what's inside of it.

00:06:36.671 --> 00:06:38.591
What is your body going to metabolize

00:06:38.591 --> 00:06:39.566
when it eats that

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:43.572
whatever's inside of the package?

00:06:43.572 --> 00:06:46.401
So carbohydrates, these
are either simple sugars

00:06:46.401 --> 00:06:48.156
like glucose or fructose,

00:06:48.156 --> 00:06:51.494
or it could be polymers of these sugars,

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:52.544
polysaccharides.

00:06:52.544 --> 00:06:54.357
It could be starches

00:06:54.987 --> 00:06:57.158
made up of many, many elements of the...

00:06:57.158 --> 00:07:00.705
Or many, many multiples
of these simple sugars.

00:07:00.705 --> 00:07:02.462
We could be talking about lipids.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.468
Lipids.

00:07:04.468 --> 00:07:07.547
So fatty acids, we could be
talking about cholesterols.

00:07:07.547 --> 00:07:09.507
These are essential structures,

00:07:09.507 --> 00:07:10.872
and they're also essential for,

00:07:10.872 --> 00:07:12.575
well, various metabolic pathways

00:07:12.575 --> 00:07:14.895
inside of, well, all of life,

00:07:14.895 --> 00:07:16.375
or it could be proteins.

00:07:16.672 --> 00:07:17.868
It could be

00:07:18.256 --> 00:07:20.072
proteins made up of amino acids.

00:07:20.072 --> 00:07:22.179
Sometimes people say the reason
why you want the proteins

00:07:22.179 --> 00:07:24.721
is because it's made up
of these amino acids.

00:07:24.721 --> 00:07:26.304
So you could break down these proteins

00:07:26.304 --> 00:07:27.781
and get the amino acids
and then build it up

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:29.208
into new proteins.

00:07:29.557 --> 00:07:32.000
Proteins and amino acids.

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:34.252
And all of these things, they are found

00:07:34.252 --> 00:07:37.218
in things like in the foods,

00:07:37.218 --> 00:07:38.335
in the foods we eat,

00:07:38.335 --> 00:07:39.769
which we will then consume,

00:07:39.769 --> 00:07:41.255
we will then metabolize.

00:07:41.255 --> 00:07:44.381
We will first catabolize
them and break them down

00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:46.228
and then we will use those building blocks

00:07:46.228 --> 00:07:48.014
to build it back up.

00:07:48.014 --> 00:07:51.073
And at the end of the day,
these provide the structures

00:07:51.073 --> 00:07:53.423
that make our bodies what they are.

00:07:53.423 --> 00:07:55.598
They allows us to interact
with our environment

00:07:55.598 --> 00:07:57.647
and they provide energy,

00:07:57.956 --> 00:07:59.959
and that energy, at the end of the day,

00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:03.292
the true molecular
currency for that energy

00:08:03.292 --> 00:08:05.937
is a molecule called ATP.

00:08:06.668 --> 00:08:09.168
That's a molecule of ATP right over there.

00:08:09.168 --> 00:08:11.541
Adenosine triphosphate.

00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:14.672
And the key for ATP, why it
is the molecular currency

00:08:14.672 --> 00:08:17.643
for energy, are the
three phosphate groups.

00:08:17.643 --> 00:08:19.463
So it has these three phosphate groups

00:08:19.463 --> 00:08:22.117
and we have a whole video on it,

00:08:22.734 --> 00:08:24.705
or a whole series of videos on it really,

00:08:24.705 --> 00:08:26.416
but the main key

00:08:26.416 --> 00:08:27.837
is that there's a lot of energy,

00:08:27.837 --> 00:08:31.184
especially beween I guess
on the last phosphate group.

00:08:31.605 --> 00:08:33.726
And this energy and that bond

00:08:33.726 --> 00:08:36.572
as the phosphate group
breaks off it can release it

00:08:36.572 --> 00:08:39.448
to provide all sorts of life mechanisms

00:08:39.448 --> 00:08:42.360
including being able to metabolize things.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.836
So ATP right over here,
this is the currency

00:08:44.836 --> 00:08:47.107
of energy in life as we know it.

00:08:47.479 --> 00:08:48.680
And it's actually an interesting molecule

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.479
because it's essentially,
it's a piece of...

00:08:51.479 --> 00:08:55.666
If you were to just take this
section of it right over here,

00:08:55.976 --> 00:08:58.254
it really is, it looks
like a piece of RNA.

00:08:58.254 --> 00:09:00.341
It looks like you're taking a...

00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:02.441
You have ribose, you have the adenine,

00:09:02.441 --> 00:09:03.708
you have a phosphate group,

00:09:03.708 --> 00:09:06.787
and it can actually be used
to construct things like RNA

00:09:06.787 --> 00:09:08.055
and even DNA

00:09:08.055 --> 00:09:11.069
beyond just being the
molecular currency of energy.

00:09:11.069 --> 00:09:13.430
So it's fun to see how these
pieces all fit together,

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:14.698
how they can be broken up,

00:09:14.698 --> 00:09:17.126
and you see these patterns
over and over again

00:09:17.126 --> 00:09:19.658
in biological systems, and
these biological systems

00:09:19.658 --> 00:09:22.954
are really just made up of breaking down

00:09:22.954 --> 00:09:25.812
and building back up
carbohydrates, lipids,

00:09:26.142 --> 00:09:28.407
fatty acids, cholesterols, other things,

00:09:28.407 --> 00:09:32.030
and proteins/amino acids.

00:09:32.143 --> 00:09:34.175
So this whole thing, you
know, look around you,

00:09:34.175 --> 00:09:36.071
look at your day, look at
the things you're consuming

00:09:36.071 --> 00:09:39.471
and you'll see this pattern
over and over and over again

00:09:39.471 --> 00:09:40.625
and it's all a little mind-blowing,

00:09:40.625 --> 00:09:41.647
because at the end of the day,

00:09:41.647 --> 00:09:44.725
the energy is coming from
the fusion reaction in stars

00:09:44.725 --> 00:09:46.969
and all of the heavy elements around you

00:09:46.969 --> 00:09:48.662
or even the not so heavy elements,

00:09:48.662 --> 00:09:50.483
all of the carbon, the oxygen,

00:09:50.483 --> 00:09:52.567
all of the really non-hydrogen elements,

00:09:52.567 --> 00:09:56.119
they've been made inside
of fusion reactions

00:09:56.119 --> 00:09:59.985
in stars that might have
existed billions and billions

00:09:59.985 --> 00:10:01.310
and billions of years ago,

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.842
so hopefully that makes you
feel a little bit more connected

00:10:03.842 --> 00:10:05.440
to the universe.
