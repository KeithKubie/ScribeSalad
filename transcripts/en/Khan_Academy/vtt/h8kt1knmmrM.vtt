00:00:00.076 --> 00:00:05.076
- The speed of sound is
approximately 768 miles per hour.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.604
When an object travels faster
than the speed of sound,

00:00:09.604 --> 00:00:12.068
it creates a sonic boom.

00:00:12.068 --> 00:00:13.446
And there's actually a whole video

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:17.249
on how sonic booms are
created, on Khan Academy.

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.008
I encourage you to watch it,
it is actually fascinating.

00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:20.508
But anyway, back to this question.

00:00:20.508 --> 00:00:23.643
Write an inequality to
represent, s, the speeds

00:00:23.643 --> 00:00:27.042
at which a moving object
creates a sonic boom.

00:00:27.042 --> 00:00:29.068
So we'll start an inequality, we'll do

00:00:29.068 --> 00:00:29.898
what they told us to.

00:00:29.898 --> 00:00:31.880
S, let's see. S has to be,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.089
they say when an object travels faster

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:35.790
than the speed of sound.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.183
So our speed has to be greater
than the speed of sound.

00:00:39.183 --> 00:00:41.909
Our speed has to be greater
than the speed of sound,

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:46.381
which is 768 miles per hour,

00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:51.014
so s has to be set greater than 768.

00:00:51.014 --> 00:00:52.148
Now another way we could have written that

00:00:52.148 --> 00:00:54.838
is that 768 needs to be less than s.

00:00:54.838 --> 00:00:59.146
We could have written 768
needs to be less than s.

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.629
That's another way we could write it.

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.381
In either case, our speed is going

00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:06.660
to be greater than 768 miles per hour.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.939
We check our answer.

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:09.731
Let's do a few more of these.

00:01:09.731 --> 00:01:11.809
To cook a steak to medium-rare,

00:01:11.809 --> 00:01:13.980
it needs to have an internal temperature

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.566
of 135 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:20.211
A lower internal temperature
will undercook the steak.

00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:22.234
Write an inequality to represent all

00:01:22.234 --> 00:01:24.632
of the possible temperatures, t,

00:01:24.632 --> 00:01:26.586
of an undercooked steak.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.706
Well, to be an undercooked steak

00:01:28.706 --> 00:01:33.706
your temperature is going
to be less than 135 degrees.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.056
So your temperature, t,
is going to be less than.

00:01:37.056 --> 00:01:39.994
You could either just use the
less than on your keyboard,

00:01:39.994 --> 00:01:41.869
or you could click over here on less than.

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.995
Your temperature is going
to be less than 135.

00:01:44.995 --> 00:01:47.552
We're assuming your temperature
is in Fahrenheit degrees.

00:01:47.552 --> 00:01:49.407
So your temperature needs to be less than

00:01:49.407 --> 00:01:52.347
Fahrenheit, less then 135 degrees,

00:01:52.347 --> 00:01:55.763
if you are going to have
an undercooked steak.

00:01:56.222 --> 00:01:58.556
So, you got that one right.

00:01:58.564 --> 00:02:01.249
Let's do a couple more.
Or one, let's do one more.

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:06.249
Simone is going snowboarding tomorrow

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.415
if the temperature is equal to or colder

00:02:10.415 --> 00:02:13.193
than five degrees celsius.

00:02:13.193 --> 00:02:14.902
Write an inequality to represent

00:02:14.902 --> 00:02:18.350
the temperatures at which
Simone will go snowboarding.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.200
So you might want to say "Oh, well

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.226
"maybe you know that t is
less than five degrees."

00:02:25.226 --> 00:02:26.120
Remember, they're telling us that

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.528
the temperature is equal to or colder,

00:02:27.528 --> 00:02:29.031
so she's even willing to go snowboarding

00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:31.594
if it's less than or
equal to five degrees.

00:02:31.594 --> 00:02:32.775
So instead of just saying less than,

00:02:32.775 --> 00:02:35.501
let's say less than or, whoops.

00:02:35.501 --> 00:02:40.361
Let's say less than or
equal to five degrees.

00:02:40.361 --> 00:02:41.872
So this inequality represented here,

00:02:41.872 --> 00:02:45.187
this shows us all of the temperatures

00:02:45.187 --> 00:02:50.187
at which she is willing
to go snowboarding.

00:02:50.982 --> 00:02:52.854
We check our answer and we got it right.
