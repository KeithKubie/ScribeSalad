00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.170
&gt;From the home screen of T-Square,
start by clicking preferences.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.980
The home screen here will let
you modify your active classes.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.530
To remove a class from your active
sites list select the class

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.930
then click on the right arrow.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.087
To show a class, select the class and

00:00:18.087 --> 00:00:22.806
click the left arrow to add
it back to your active sites.

00:00:22.806 --> 00:00:26.359
So let me go ahead and hide
the classes that I'm not currently in.

00:00:30.236 --> 00:00:33.765
Then I'm going to click
update preferences.

00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:35.541
Then once I refresh the page,

00:00:35.541 --> 00:00:39.510
I will only see those two
courses at the top of the page.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.310
So again, this won't remove your
access to the classes altogether.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.680
This just toggles which
classes appear above.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.830
You can always access any
class you've already taken by

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.340
clicking membership up here.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.100
As you can see, here are all the classes
that I have taken at Georgia Tech.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.380
&gt;&gt; Generally in the OMS program, you
probably won't take enough classes to

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.210
really need to worry about
hiding inactive classes.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.269
But if you've done other degrees
in the past at Georgia Tech,

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.910
you might need to hide some of these.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.430
My box is 82 classes, so
I definitely need to hide some.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.940
&gt;&gt; So once you start the program,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.300
you might receive more notifications
than what you would like to see.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.640
Therefore, in order to tweak this,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.210
you can go to the notifications
tab at the top.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.720
Here, you can play with
some of these features and

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.110
opt in to receive only the messages
that you would like to receive.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.470
So in my case, I only want to be updated
about new resources once per day.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.160
So I would click here.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.000
And then I would update
preferences here.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.975
The most important one though,
is the ability to change your time zone.

00:01:41.975 --> 00:01:46.225
This isn't a big deal to on-campus
students, but online, it's crucial.

00:01:46.225 --> 00:01:49.215
We encourage most of our classes
to make their assignments

00:01:49.215 --> 00:01:51.855
due at 12:00 AM UTC-12 time zone.

00:01:51.855 --> 00:01:55.635
But it's hard to translate
that to your local time.

00:01:56.655 --> 00:02:00.820
So even though I'm in Eastern time zone,
let's pretend I'm in Pacific.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.760
I would then select Pacific and
then I would update preferences.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.110
So now that I've switched
over to Pacific time zone,

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.580
all of my assignments show that
they are due at 5 AM Pacific time.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.590
We'll talk more about
the assignment screen in a bit.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.150
&gt;&gt; That covers the settings that
affect T-Square as a whole.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.015
Any change you make here will affect
every class you're currently in in

00:02:23.015 --> 00:02:23.970
T-Square.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.247
So now let's take a look at
some of the tools that apply to

00:02:26.247 --> 00:02:27.370
only individual classes.
