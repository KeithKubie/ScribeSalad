00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.207
- [Voiceover] The pH at
the equivalence point

00:00:02.207 --> 00:00:05.411
of the titration is measured to be 2.54.

00:00:05.411 --> 00:00:06.887
Which of the following indicators

00:00:06.887 --> 00:00:08.548
would be the best choice for determining

00:00:08.548 --> 00:00:10.614
the end point of the titration?

00:00:10.614 --> 00:00:12.402
Justify your answer.

00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:13.459
Well let's just remind ourselves,

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:15.317
the endpoint of the titration

00:00:15.317 --> 00:00:17.616
is when the indicator changes color,

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:20.890
and because that's our
signal, our visual signal,

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.642
it's saying, "Hey, we must've
hit the equivalence point,"

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:27.264
you want the pKa of your indicator

00:00:27.264 --> 00:00:29.377
to be as close as possible to the pH

00:00:29.377 --> 00:00:30.771
at the equivalence point.

00:00:30.771 --> 00:00:33.627
If the pH at the
equivalence point is 2.54,

00:00:33.627 --> 00:00:37.272
well which of these indicators
have the closes pKa to that?

00:00:37.272 --> 00:00:39.850
Well we see thymol blue has
it at two right over here,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.799
so we would choose to use thymol blue,

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:43.799
thymol blue,

00:00:46.854 --> 00:00:48.399
because

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:49.232
its pKa

00:00:52.255 --> 00:00:53.088
closest

00:00:54.128 --> 00:00:54.961
to pH

00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.622
at equivalence point.

00:00:59.622 --> 00:01:00.622
Equivalence,

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:03.328
equivalence point.

00:01:05.705 --> 00:01:06.788
There you go.
