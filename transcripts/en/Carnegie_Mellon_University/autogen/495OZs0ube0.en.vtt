energy use namely utility bills and it

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980
energy use namely utility bills and it
 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.709
energy use namely utility bills and it
takes a fair amount of effort to find

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719

much information about utility bills

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370
much information about utility bills
 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.010
much information about utility bills
prior to lease signing and it's hard to

prior to lease signing and it's hard to
 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.540
prior to lease signing and it's hard to
interpret that information and so we

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550
interpret that information and so we
 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.340
interpret that information and so we
tried to provide better information

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350
tried to provide better information
 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.770

and it's also important because we're
 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.910
and it's also important because we're
dealing with a multi-stakeholder system

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920
dealing with a multi-stakeholder system

perhaps to think about upgrading their
infrastructure or providing better

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390
infrastructure or providing better
 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.020

services around energy use finally we

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030
services around energy use finally we
 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.370
services around energy use finally we
believe that the kind of data that we're

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380
believe that the kind of data that we're
 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.830
believe that the kind of data that we're
collecting can impact policymakers so we

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840
collecting can impact policymakers so we
 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.719
collecting can impact policymakers so we
hope to have an impact at multiple

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729
hope to have an impact at multiple
 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.300
hope to have an impact at multiple
levels with edicts

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310
