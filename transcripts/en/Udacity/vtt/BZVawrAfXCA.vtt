00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.075
All right.
Well that was painful.

00:00:01.075 --> 00:00:06.100
[LAUGH] That's the mathematics
behind sort of the general

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.150
way of thinking about prediction and
correction cycle of tracking.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.240
Fortunately it gets a lot easier
when we look at specific cases.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.760
Spec, specific models of how to do that.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.533
What we're going to do in the next
one is look at a very very simple

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:24.207
analytic form of doing this
called the Kalmen filter.

00:00:24.207 --> 00:00:27.891
We won't, we'll show you the equations,
we'll you the update, we'll show you

00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:31.165
the intuition behind it, without
necessarily deriving the equations.

00:00:31.165 --> 00:00:35.822
Then what we're going to do is show you
sort of a more modern approach using

00:00:35.822 --> 00:00:39.706
it's referred to as particle
filtering in computer vision, but

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:43.828
basically it's this idea of using
samples to represent densities.

00:00:43.828 --> 00:00:47.190
And when we do computing,
envision, robotics, et cetera.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.920
The idea of using samples to represent
densities gives us a lot of power

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.760
because we're not limited to particular,
analytic, distributions.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.040
So that will make those integrals,
either easier or

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.130
even better just simply go away.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.560
So, let's do that next.
