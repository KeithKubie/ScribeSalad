00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:08.750
One-fourth divided by one-third can also
be written as one-fourth times 3 over 1.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.830
1 times 3 equals 3, and 4 times 1 equals
4, so that gives us three-fourths.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:21.890
One-third divided by one-fourth can also
be written as one-third times 4 over 1.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.110
1 times 4 gives us 4,
and 3 times 1 is 3.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.400
This is important.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.390
Notice that the order matters.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.865
One-fourth divided by one-third is not
the same thing as one-third divided by

00:00:33.865 --> 00:00:35.500
one-fourth.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.511
Five-twelfths divided by one-fourth

00:00:38.511 --> 00:00:42.320
can be written as
five-twelfths times 4 over 1.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.070
5 times 4 equals 20, and
12 times 1 equals 12.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.890
This needs to be simplified.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.510
We know that 20 and
12 share a common factor of 4.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:00.080
20 can be written as 4 times 5, and
12 can be written as 4 times 3.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.500
I divide out the 4 from the top and
the bottom, and that leaves five-thirds.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.613
Two-ninths divided by three-fifths can
also be written as two-ninths times

00:01:09.613 --> 00:01:10.490
five-thirds.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.210
2 times 5 gives us 10,
and 9 times 3 gives us 27.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.070
This is already simplified,
so this is our answer.
