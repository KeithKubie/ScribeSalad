00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.701 align:start position:0% line:91%
IMPORTANT BLACK VOICES IN
AMERICAN HISTORY.

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:37.170 line:85%

YEAH!

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:46.913 align:start position:0% line:91%
I THOUGHT OUR SHOW LAST NIGHT
WAS BALLER!

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:51.617 align:start position:0% line:91%
ARE YOU JUST GOING TO LEAVE ME
HANGING?

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.151 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:54.554 align:start position:0% line:85%
SO WHAT ELSE HAPPENED?

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:57.290 line:91%
OH, YEAH, THE LEAD-IN TO OUR
SHOW WAS THE PRESIDENT'S STATE

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:58.458 align:start position:0% line:85%
OF THE UNION SPEECH.

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:01.227 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT WHAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON
TONIGHT IS THE STATE OF OBAMA,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.395 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:01:02.428 --> 00:01:04.664 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW, BEFORE WE GET IN TOO DEEP
ON THIS, I NEED TO BE CLEAR

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:05.465 align:start position:0% line:85%
ABOUT SOMETHING.

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:09.635 align:start position:0% line:91%
I VOTED FOR OBAMA BECAUSE HE'S
BLACK.

( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:01:14.673 --> 00:01:15.908 size:75% position:38% line:85%
I'M JUST CLEARING IT UP.

00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:19.745 align:start position:0% line:91%
PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME, "BUT,
LARRY--" THIS IS TRUE.

00:01:19.778 --> 00:01:23.382 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS IS NOT-- THIS IS NOT AN
IMAGINED CONVERSATION, YOU GUYS.

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:30.256 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
OH, IT'S TWO LARRYS.

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:33.426 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT "BUT, LARRY, DO YOU AGREE
WITH OBAMA'S POLICIES?"

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:37.897 line:91%
AND HERE'S THE TRUTH-- I AGREE
WITH THE POLICY THAT HE'S BLACK.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.733 align:start position:0% line:91%
( APPLAUSE )
AND-- WHICH AND THEN THEY SAY,

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:44.170 align:start position:0% line:91%
"BUT SHOULDN'T YOU VOTE BASED ON
PRINCIPLE?"

00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:45.805 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S CORRECT.

00:01:45.838 --> 00:01:52.211 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND MY GUIDING PRINCIPLE IS THAT
AS LONG AS HE'S STILL BLACK--

00:01:52.244 --> 00:01:55.348 align:start position:0% line:91%
( APPLAUSE )
HE AND I AGREE ON PRINCIPLE.

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:55.882 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE'RE GOOD.

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:56.949 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE'RE GOOD.

00:01:56.982 --> 00:01:57.650 align:start position:0% line:85%
YES.

00:01:57.683 --> 00:01:57.984 align:start position:0% line:85%
EXACTLY.

00:01:58.017 --> 00:01:59.252 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:02.388 align:start position:0% line:91%
I JUST WANTED TO LAY THE
GROUNDWORK FOR WHAT'S ABOUT TO

00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:03.189 align:start position:0% line:85%
COME, OKAY.

00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:04.757 align:start position:0% line:91%
OKAY, BACK TO THE STATE OF THE
UNION.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.792 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
SO LET'S CHECK IN AND SEE HOW
HE'S DOING.

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:12.532 line:91%
&gt;&gt; TONIGHT, AFTER A BREAKTHROUGH
YEAR FOR AMERICA, OUR ECONOMY IS

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:16.736 align:start position:0% line:91%
GROWING AND CREATING JOBS AT THE

WHAT ELSE?

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:33.252 line:85%
THE ECONOMY IS IN GOOD SHAPE.

00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:34.487 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY, THAT'S A BONUS.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.922 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT ELSE DID THE PRESIDENT HAVE
TO SAY?

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:42.261 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%

MAN, THAT'S DREAMING BIG.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.452 line:85%

HOPE-Y.

00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:12.225 size:78% position:39% line:91%

I MEAN, BOTH HOUSES BY HISTORIC
MARGINS.

EVEN HIS OWN PARTY WAS DESERTING
HIM.

ABLE TO GET ANYTHING DONE IN HIS

AND THEN TECHNICALLY IT DOES
STOP.

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:51.190 size:88% position:44% line:85%
OBAMA, HE JUST DOESN'T CARE.
