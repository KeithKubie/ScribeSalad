00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.780
Whew, that feels good.

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:02.870
We solved everything.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:03.800
&gt;&gt; Not everything.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.410
So we handled the two
relatively easy cases,

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.880
though that second one I admit was
a little bit more of a workout.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.285
The next one is going to
be conceptually trickier.

00:00:13.285 --> 00:00:15.065
But the algebra's not
going to be much worse and

00:00:15.065 --> 00:00:17.555
this is going to be in
the context of reward shaping.

00:00:17.555 --> 00:00:20.985
So, have you heard this phrase
Reward Shaping, before?

00:00:20.985 --> 00:00:23.035
It comes up often when
people are talking about,

00:00:23.035 --> 00:00:27.635
wow, how did they train that
dolphin to jump through a hoop?

00:00:27.635 --> 00:00:31.785
So it's tricky to imagine how you might
have gotten a dolphin to jump through

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:36.090
a flaming hoop, out of the water and
then splashing down on the other side.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.140
Because it's not the kind of
thing if you were to train it.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.380
Well you can't tell it what to do.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.736
Because they tend not to
listen unless you go [NOISE].

00:00:43.736 --> 00:00:47.920
And you can't reward it just for
having done the right thing.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.270
Because if you've had this flaming hoop
up in the air and you just wait for

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.039
the dolphin to jump through it and
you give it a treat.

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:56.170
Plus one if it does it and

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.910
otherwise you don't give it a treat
it's never going to figure that out.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.910
It's never going to inadvertently
hop through that hoop and say, hey,

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:02.680
do I get a reward?

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.020
So, how do you suppose they
actually train dolphins to do this?

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.120
&gt;&gt; I have no idea, but I'm going to
guess about how they do this.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.670
Because I'm not as into
dolphins as you apparently are.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.420
What I assume that they do is they have
to coax the dolphin to jump through

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.160
the hoop in the first place, by making
it worth his or her while to do.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.640
So you kind of reward it maybe for
jumping first and

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.530
then getting near the hoop
without the fire, with the fire.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.310
You just keep giving it kind of
rewards for getting close enough until

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.570
it rather than inadvertently
jumping through the hoop,

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.470
decides that that must be
the right thing to do now.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that's
[LAUGH] some approximation

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.920
of what I imagine that they'd do.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.600
My understanding is that they'll
start off with something like

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.680
you put the hoop in the water.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.490
And you put a fish next to the hoop,
right?

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.720
So that the dolphin swims over and
eats the fish.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.510
And then you start saying
to the dolphin, well,

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.660
you start changing when
you pay off the dolphin.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.490
You don't give it fish for just touching
the hoop, or for being near the hoop.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.800
You give it a fish for
actually touching it with its nose.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.830
And then you lift it out of
the water a little bit, and

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.440
then it has to swim
faster to get up to it.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.850
And then you lift it out of
the water a little more and

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.000
it has to jump all the way through.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.860
And then,
yeah once it's all the way at the top

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.480
eventually you can light
on the fire I guess.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.600
I actually don't think I ever seen
a dolphin jump through a flaming hoop.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.210
So we might want to
extinguish some of that.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.200
But that's not really the point.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.770
The point is that it's this
series of mini rewards

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.220
along the route to the big payoff that
helps provide the right kind of hints.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.640
&gt;&gt; That's cool.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.730
&gt;&gt; I'm going to say life.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.250
Like you don't have to
just say grad school.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.160
Like most of the things
we do are like this.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.900
We don't wait to

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.190
get the big reward after we've
inadvertently done the desired behavior.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.770
We get hints along the way.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.550
&gt;&gt; You've clearly never
met any of my students.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.050
But okay.
