00:00:00.245 --> 00:00:02.758
 Let's think about how to divide numbers into categories. 

00:00:02.758 --> 00:00:03.786
 This will be very helpful, 

00:00:03.786 --> 00:00:05.783
 because when we introduce the numbers plus numbers in each other, 

00:00:05.783 --> 00:00:09.612
 we will be able to make more concessions more easily. 

00:00:09.612 --> 00:00:11.704
 Let's look at the problem. 

00:00:11.704 --> 00:00:15.250
 Leah is not sure how to add numbers 39 and 61. 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.544
 Help Lea choose the right option, 

00:00:17.544 --> 00:00:20.944
 which is the same as 39 plus 61. 

00:00:20.944 --> 00:00:22.524
 So, let's look at the options. 

00:00:22.524 --> 00:00:25.296
 In the first version we have 30 plus 60 

00:00:25.296 --> 00:00:26.582
 plus 90, plus ten. 

00:00:26.582 --> 00:00:27.766
 And at first I advise you to stop the video 

00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:30.378
 and try to solve the problem yourself. 

00:00:30.378 --> 00:00:31.365
 So this is the first option, 

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:33.420
 where did they get these 30? 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.195
 Well, 30 are the same three, 

00:00:37.305 --> 00:00:39.775
 and I have more than three dozen here. 

00:00:39.776 --> 00:00:41.133
 39 of them are 3 

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:44.662
 is a category of tens and it means 30 or 3 dozens. 

00:00:44.662 --> 00:00:47.350
 And then we have 60, 

00:00:47.355 --> 00:00:49.500
 And where did it come from? 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.100
 Very good, in 61, 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.788
 these six are in the tenths category, 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.841
 then it is 60. 

00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:57.908
 And then we have 90 plus. 

00:00:57.908 --> 00:01:00.381
 Now, where did those 90 come from? 

00:01:00.381 --> 00:01:03.248
 I do not see any visible 90. 

00:01:03.248 --> 00:01:04.245
 Maybe you get embarrassed, 

00:01:04.245 --> 00:01:06.243
 because there is a number 9, 

00:01:06.243 --> 00:01:07.345
 but it is a unit of units, 

00:01:07.346 --> 00:01:08.809
 not tens. 

00:01:08.809 --> 00:01:12.408
 So it's 9, not 90. 

00:01:12.408 --> 00:01:13.725
 And I also have 1 point. 

00:01:13.725 --> 00:01:15.565
 I do not have any 90. 

00:01:15.565 --> 00:01:17.307
 Also, I do not definitely have 10. 

00:01:17.307 --> 00:01:18.142
 So this version would be right, 

00:01:18.142 --> 00:01:19.604
 if instead of 90? 

00:01:19.605 --> 00:01:21.680
 9 had been written, 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.256
 and instead of ten, 

00:01:22.256 --> 00:01:25.136
 had been given 1, 

00:01:25.136 --> 00:01:26.901
 because we have 1 class in this category 

00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:28.840
 it would be right, 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.885
 but this version is incorrect. 

00:01:28.885 --> 00:01:31.637
 It does not say 30 plus 60 plus 9 plus 1 

00:01:31.637 --> 00:01:33.773
 says 30 plus 60 plus 90 plus 10. 

00:01:33.773 --> 00:01:36.710
 So, we do not choose this first option. 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.836
 Go to the next version, where: 

00:01:37.836 --> 00:01:40.111
 we have 30 plus 60 plus 9 plus 1, 

00:01:40.111 --> 00:01:41.771
 which is correct and correct, 

00:01:41.771 --> 00:01:45.799
 because we have 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.725
 30 plus 9 here, 

00:01:49.725 --> 00:01:52.410
 which is equal to 39. 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.761
 And then 60 plus 1, 

00:01:56.761 --> 00:01:58.967
 which turns 61. 

00:01:58.967 --> 00:02:00.743
 So these two expressions are equal. 

00:02:00.743 --> 00:02:03.564
 And why did I want to divide the numbers into parts, 

00:02:03.564 --> 00:02:05.443
 because in this way you can easily say in your mind, 

00:02:05.444 --> 00:02:06.140
 30 plus 60 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.789
 it is 3 dozens plus 6 dozens, which is equal to 9 dozen. 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.501
 So, these two parts 

00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:14.939
 are equal to 90's. 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:16.160
 And 9 plus 1 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.646
 turns ten. 

00:02:17.646 --> 00:02:18.644
 And at the end, 90 plus 10, 

00:02:18.645 --> 00:02:20.304
 very well, this is equal to 100. 

00:02:20.304 --> 00:02:21.801
 But they did not demand that we score the result, 

00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:22.522
 but just asking them: 

00:02:22.522 --> 00:02:25.150
 Which of the options is the right one and exactly the same? 

00:02:25.151 --> 00:02:27.549
 The phrase shows what we are given. 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:28.895
 And we can say this option: 

00:02:28.895 --> 00:02:29.696
 So we got the answer, 

00:02:29.696 --> 00:02:31.855
 but also make sure that this is the wrong option. 

00:02:31.855 --> 00:02:33.214
 We have 9 plus 1, 

00:02:33.214 --> 00:02:35.454
 after 3 plus 6. 

00:02:35.454 --> 00:02:36.476
 See our 3, 

00:02:36.476 --> 00:02:37.916
 is not just 3, 

00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:40.516
 but it is 3, ie 30 is equal. 

00:02:40.516 --> 00:02:41.816
 Had this been 30? 

00:02:41.816 --> 00:02:43.314
 And this is 6 dozens, 

00:02:43.314 --> 00:02:43.952
 not 6, 

00:02:43.952 --> 00:02:45.160
 then it should have been written in 60, 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.817
 So this option is definitely excluded. 

00:02:49.818 --> 00:02:51.440
 Take another example. 

00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:55.917
 Which option is the same as in 41 plus 57? 

00:02:55.917 --> 00:02:57.389
 And here, all the numbers are divided into categories, 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:58.817
 tenths and units. 

00:03:02.254 --> 00:03:05.991
 So: I have four categories. 

00:03:05.991 --> 00:03:09.195
 So it will be fourteen, 

00:03:09.195 --> 00:03:11.390
 and we have a 1. 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.909
 Suppose we have one unit. 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.488
 This is 41. 

00:03:15.488 --> 00:03:17.635
 And then the number 57, 

00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:19.572
 in the category of tens 

00:03:19.573 --> 00:03:20.537
 we have 5, 

00:03:20.537 --> 00:03:23.648
 that is, five dozen 

00:03:23.648 --> 00:03:25.890
 and we have 7 points in the rankings. 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.615
 Come to think of the options that are the same 

00:03:30.615 --> 00:03:32.366
 What exactly have I just written? 

00:03:32.366 --> 00:03:33.737
 In the first version, 

00:03:33.737 --> 00:03:37.363
 We have 4 dozen 

00:03:37.363 --> 00:03:38.603
 and one point. 

00:03:40.608 --> 00:03:42.163
 It's 

00:03:42.163 --> 00:03:44.103
 It's the 41st. 

00:03:47.906 --> 00:03:49.896
 And we also have, 

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:54.376
 5 dozens and 7 points. 

00:03:57.265 --> 00:03:59.760
 Thus, this first version fully meets the requirement, 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.465
 only a little moved. 

00:04:02.466 --> 00:04:03.209
 If we write 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.602
 4 dozens plus 5 dozen 

00:04:04.602 --> 00:04:07.630
 plus 1 point, plus 7 points 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.757
 it is the same thing as the first. 

00:04:08.758 --> 00:04:10.128
 And now we already know that we have found the right answer, 

00:04:10.128 --> 00:04:11.903
 but let's make sure that the other 

00:04:11.903 --> 00:04:13.518
 versions have errors. 

00:04:13.518 --> 00:04:16.107
 We know that fourteen are true, 

00:04:16.107 --> 00:04:17.767
 but then plus a dozen. 

00:04:17.767 --> 00:04:20.700
 Here, 1 of the points has been moved 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.517
 and has become dozens, 

00:04:21.517 --> 00:04:23.165
 then this option is definitely wrong. 

00:04:23.165 --> 00:04:24.766
 And also written 5 points, 

00:04:24.766 --> 00:04:26.717
 but we have 5 dozens, 

00:04:26.717 --> 00:04:27.866
 not 5 points. 

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:29.805
 So this is definitely a wrong option. 

00:04:29.805 --> 00:04:31.965
 In the 3rd variant, 4 points are written, 

00:04:31.965 --> 00:04:32.626
 this is our 4th, 

00:04:32.626 --> 00:04:33.659
 it is a category of tens, 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.180
 It is the same 4 tick. 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.142
 And then it is written 5 points, 

00:04:38.524 --> 00:04:39.917
 This should have been 5 dozens. 

00:04:39.917 --> 00:04:41.321
 It's a mistake, this should have been dozens, 

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:43.318
 and this is also a dozen. 

00:04:43.318 --> 00:04:46.447
 So, we were convinced that only the first version was right.
