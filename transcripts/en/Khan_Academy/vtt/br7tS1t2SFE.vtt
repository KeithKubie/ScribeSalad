00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.840
A vector is something that has
both magnitude and direction.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.620
Magnitude and direction.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.660
So let's think of an example
of what wouldn't and what

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.380
would be a vector.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.990
So if someone tells
you that something

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.340
is moving at 5 miles per hour,
this information by itself

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.870
is not a vector quantity.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.010
It's only specifying
a magnitude.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.760
We don't know what
direction this thing is

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.010
moving 5 miles per hour in.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.810
So this right over
here, which is often

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:38.100
referred to as a speed, is not a
vector quantity just by itself.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.510
This is considered to
be a scalar quantity.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.520
If we want it to be a
vector, we would also

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.970
have to specify the direction.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.070
So for example,
someone might say

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.670
it's moving 5 miles
per hour east.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.490
So let's say it's moving
5 miles per hour due east.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.740
So now this combined 5
miles per are due east,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.470
this is a vector quantity.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.460
And now we wouldn't
call it speed anymore.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.110
We would call it velocity.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.940
So velocity is a vector.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.900
We're specifying the
magnitude, 5 miles per hour,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.580
and the direction east.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.650
But how can we actually
visualize this?

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.241
So let's say we're
operating in two dimensions.

00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:19.740
And what's neat
about linear algebra

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.420
is obviously a lot
of what applies

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.420
in two dimensions
will extend to three.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.170
And then even four, five, six,
as made dimensions as we want.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.080
Our brains have trouble
visualizing beyond three.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.860
But what's neat is
we can mathematically

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.820
deal with beyond three
using linear algebra.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.770
And we'll see that
in future videos.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.590
But let's just go back to
our straight traditional

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.640
two-dimensional vector
right over here.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.270
So one way we
could represent it,

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.020
as an arrow that
is 5 units long.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.530
We'll assume that each of our
units here is miles per hour.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.590
And that's pointed
to the right, where

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.030
we'll say the right is east.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.220
So for example, I could start
an arrow right over here.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.670
And I could make its length 5.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.130
The length of the arrow
specifies the magnitude.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.020
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.610
And then the direction
that the arrow

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.290
is pointed in specifies
it's direction.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.160
So this right over here could
represent visually this vector.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.980
If we say that the
horizontal axis is say east,

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.310
or the positive horizontal
direction is moving

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.630
in the east, this would be
west, that would be north,

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.682
and then that would be south.

00:02:28.682 --> 00:02:30.890
Now, what's interesting
about vectors is that we only

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.970
care about the magnitude
in the direction.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.240
We don't necessarily
not care where we start,

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.060
where we place it when we think
about it visually like this.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.500
So for example, this would
be the exact same vector,

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.500
or be equivalent vector to this.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.997
This vector has the same length.

00:02:45.997 --> 00:02:47.205
So it has the same magnitude.

00:02:47.205 --> 00:02:49.010
It has a length of 5.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.250
And its direction
is also due east.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.627
So these two vectors
are equivalent.

00:02:53.627 --> 00:02:56.210
Now one thing that you might say
is, well, that's fair enough.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.500
But how do we represent
it with a little bit

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.930
more mathematical notation?

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.554
So we don't have to
draw it every time.

00:03:00.554 --> 00:03:02.670
And we could start
performing operations on it.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.340
Well, the typical
way, one, if you

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.440
want a variable to
represent a vector,

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.780
is usually a lowercase letter.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.121
If you're publishing a
book, you can bold it.

00:03:11.121 --> 00:03:12.870
But when you're doing
it in your notebook,

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.670
you would typically put a
little arrow on top of it.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.925
And there are several
ways that you could do it.

00:03:17.925 --> 00:03:20.050
You could literally say,
hey 5 miles per hour east.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.758
But that doesn't feel
like you can really

00:03:21.758 --> 00:03:23.620
operate on that easily.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.640
The typical way is to specify,
if you're in two dimensions,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.180
to specify two
numbers that tell you

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.770
how much is this vector moving
in each of these dimensions?

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.564
So for example,
this one only moves

00:03:35.564 --> 00:03:36.730
in the horizontal dimension.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.640
And so we'll put our
horizontal dimension first.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.590
So you might call
this vector 5, 0.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.120
It's moving 5, positive 5
in the horizontal direction.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.320
And it's not moving at all
in the vertical direction.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.690
And the notation might change.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.315
You might also see notation, and
actually in the linear algebra

00:03:55.315 --> 00:03:57.110
context, it's more
typical to write it

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.270
as a column vector
like this-- 5, 0.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.130
This once again,
the first coordinate

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.090
represents how much we're moving
in the horizontal direction.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.870
And the second coordinate
represents how much

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.309
are we moving in the
vertical direction.

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:16.850
Now, this one isn't
that interesting.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.058
You could have other vectors.

00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:20.640
You could have a vector
that looks like this.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.950
Let's say it's moving 3 in
the horizontal direction.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.590
And positive 4.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.700
So 1, 2, 3, 4 in the
vertical direction.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:36.320
So it might look
something like this.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.400
So this could be another
vector right over here.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.420
Maybe we call this
vector, vector a.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.250
And once again, I want to
specify that is a vector.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.410
And you see here that if
you were to break it down,

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:57.330
in the horizontal direction,
it's shifting three

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.900
in the horizontal direction,
and it's shifting positive four

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.580
in the vertical direction.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.650
And we get that by
literally thinking

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.890
about how much we're moving
up and how much we're

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.130
moving to the right when we
start at the end of the arrow

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.840
and go to the front of it.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:19.650
So this vector might
be specified as 3, 4.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.792
3, 4.

00:05:20.792 --> 00:05:22.500
And you could use the
Pythagorean theorem

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.940
to figure out the actual
length of this vector.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.870
And you'll see because this is
a 3, 4, 5 triangle, that this

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.480
actually has a magnitude of 5.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.480
And as we study more
and more linear algebra,

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.980
we're going to start extending
these to multiple dimensions.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.810
Obviously we can visualize
up to three dimensions.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.929
In four dimensions it
becomes more abstract.

00:05:40.929 --> 00:05:42.970
And that's why this type
of a notation is useful.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.100
Because it's very hard to draw
a 4, 5, or 20 dimensional arrow

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.910
like this.
