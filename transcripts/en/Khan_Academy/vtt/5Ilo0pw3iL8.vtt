00:00:00.543 --> 00:00:01.681
- [Instructor] We're told the quantities

00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:04.281
x and y are proportional,

00:00:04.281 --> 00:00:06.302
and then they give us a
table where they give us

00:00:06.302 --> 00:00:09.181
a bunch of x's and they give
us the corresponding y's.

00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:11.108
When x is four, y is 10.

00:00:11.108 --> 00:00:15.288
When x is five, y is 12.5,
and so on and so forth.

00:00:15.288 --> 00:00:19.165
Find the constant of proportionality, r,

00:00:19.165 --> 00:00:22.498
in the equation y is equal to r times x.

00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:27.455
So pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:29.336
All right so we wanna find the constant,

00:00:29.336 --> 00:00:31.426
the constant of proportionality,

00:00:31.426 --> 00:00:32.842
I sometimes have trouble saying that,

00:00:32.842 --> 00:00:35.512
r, where if I for any x,

00:00:35.512 --> 00:00:38.012
if I multiply it by r I get y.

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:40.876
Well we just have to
look at each of these x's

00:00:40.876 --> 00:00:43.059
and figure out well what
are we multiplying by

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:44.847
to get to y.

00:00:44.847 --> 00:00:47.726
So what do I have to multiply
four by to get to 10?

00:00:47.726 --> 00:00:50.861
Well if you multiply it by 10/4,

00:00:50.861 --> 00:00:54.297
if you multiply it by 10/4,
then you're gonna get to 10.

00:00:54.297 --> 00:00:58.430
And 10/4 is the same thing
as multiplying it by,

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.613
let's see that is 2 1/2.

00:01:00.613 --> 00:01:03.121
So this is times 2 1/2.

00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:04.607
So let's see does that hold?

00:01:04.607 --> 00:01:06.975
In every case if I multiply by 2 1/2,

00:01:06.975 --> 00:01:10.017
if I multiply x by 2 1/2, do I get y?

00:01:10.017 --> 00:01:12.014
So five times 2 1/2,

00:01:12.014 --> 00:01:15.358
five times two is 10, and
then another 1/2 is 2.5.

00:01:15.358 --> 00:01:17.935
It indeed does equals 12.5.

00:01:17.935 --> 00:01:19.816
Five times 2.5.

00:01:19.816 --> 00:01:21.697
And then here 10 times 2.5

00:01:21.697 --> 00:01:22.864
is clearly 25.

00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:25.551
And you can work it out by hand.

00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:27.920
I did the little bit of the
multiplication in my head,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.475
but you can see in every case,

00:01:29.475 --> 00:01:33.678
I take my x, I multiply
it by 2.5, I get my y.

00:01:33.678 --> 00:01:35.977
So in every case I take
my x and multiply it

00:01:35.977 --> 00:01:39.878
by the constant of
proportionality 2.5, I get my y.

00:01:39.878 --> 00:01:41.527
So what's the constant of proportionality?

00:01:41.527 --> 00:01:42.360
It is 2.5.
