with science Commons is that data gets

more powerful if it gets linked up to

is that when you connect things they

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810
is that when you connect things they
 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.240
is that when you connect things they
tend to get more valuable if they're at

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250
tend to get more valuable if they're at
 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.750

good fortune there and the idea was that
the law should have an interface in the

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:29.780
the law should have an interface in the
 

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.540
the law should have an interface in the
same way that computer networks have an

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:31.550
same way that computer networks have an
 

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.480
same way that computer networks have an
interface so if you want a a copyright

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:34.490
interface so if you want a a copyright
 

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.249

you like to allow derivative works and

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:39.650
you like to allow derivative works and

you like to allow derivative works and
if you choose to allow derivative works

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:41.000
if you choose to allow derivative works
 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.390
if you choose to allow derivative works
you can impose a requirement that any

licensing and in science it's a little
 

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.070

different and it's always been the case

that you create property in science by

I kind of changed my title around
because when I was thinking about it

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:53.560
because when I was thinking about it
 

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.950
because when I was thinking about it
it's really about together open data and

is that we feel that one of the barriers
to preservation of polar data is that

00:40:26.349 --> 00:40:28.679
and get the rights of the data from all
those individuals it's a very intensive

00:40:28.679 --> 00:40:28.689
those individuals it's a very intensive
 

00:40:28.689 --> 00:40:31.109
those individuals it's a very intensive
effort but if the community is made the

00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119
effort but if the community is made the
 

00:40:31.119 --> 00:40:33.509
effort but if the community is made the
data available whatever form wherever it

00:40:33.509 --> 00:40:33.519
data available whatever form wherever it
 

00:40:33.519 --> 00:40:35.900
data available whatever form wherever it
is it actually makes it much easier for

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:35.910
is it actually makes it much easier for
 

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:39.299
is it actually makes it much easier for
archives to go out and mine and look and

00:40:39.299 --> 00:40:39.309
archives to go out and mine and look and
 

00:40:39.309 --> 00:40:41.339
archives to go out and mine and look and
say well you know if I got that data and

00:40:41.339 --> 00:40:41.349
say well you know if I got that data and
 

00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:43.410
say well you know if I got that data and
integrated it with this larger

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:43.420
integrated it with this larger
 

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:46.229
integrated it with this larger
collection it would make every the

00:40:46.229 --> 00:40:46.239
collection it would make every the
 

00:40:46.239 --> 00:40:47.969
collection it would make every the
original data and the collective

00:40:47.969 --> 00:40:47.979
original data and the collective
 

00:40:47.979 --> 00:40:49.859
original data and the collective
resource much more valuable for

00:40:49.859 --> 00:40:49.869
resource much more valuable for
 

00:40:49.869 --> 00:40:51.839
resource much more valuable for
everybody so they can just do that

00:40:51.839 --> 00:40:51.849
everybody so they can just do that
 

00:40:51.849 --> 00:40:54.359
everybody so they can just do that
because it can find it through the pic

00:40:54.359 --> 00:40:54.369
because it can find it through the pic
 

00:40:54.369 --> 00:40:56.819
because it can find it through the pic
badge they can know the rights through

they can use it and do it without having
to do too much consultation and that's

00:41:05.819 --> 00:41:05.829
to do too much consultation and that's
 

00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:08.089
to do too much consultation and that's
important because you know data sources

00:41:08.089 --> 00:41:08.099
important because you know data sources
 

00:41:08.099 --> 00:41:11.759
important because you know data sources
disappear they change the authors die

00:41:11.759 --> 00:41:11.769
disappear they change the authors die
 

00:41:11.769 --> 00:41:15.089
disappear they change the authors die
they lose track of things so having the

00:41:15.089 --> 00:41:15.099
they lose track of things so having the
 

00:41:15.099 --> 00:41:18.559
they lose track of things so having the

and hopefully the curation process much

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:25.130
and hopefully the curation process much
 

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:27.880
and hopefully the curation process much
more doable from the viewpoint of you

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:27.890
more doable from the viewpoint of you
 

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:30.310
more doable from the viewpoint of you
know the institutions and groups that

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:30.320
know the institutions and groups that
 

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:35.070
know the institutions and groups that
are interested in polar data stewardship

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:35.080
are interested in polar data stewardship
 

00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:39.430
are interested in polar data stewardship
so you know just to kind of sum up

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.440
so you know just to kind of sum up
 

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:43.320
so you know just to kind of sum up
science clearly is important and

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:43.330
science clearly is important and
 

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:47.400
science clearly is important and
sustainable development is is very much

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:47.410
sustainable development is is very much
 

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:50.710
sustainable development is is very much
need science to help resolve the many

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720
need science to help resolve the many
 

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.920
need science to help resolve the many
challenges out there open access has a

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:53.930
challenges out there open access has a
 

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:56.170
challenges out there open access has a
lot of potential benefits for research

00:41:56.170 --> 00:41:56.180
lot of potential benefits for research
 

00:41:56.180 --> 00:42:00.040
lot of potential benefits for research
and for data you know just looking at

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:00.050
and for data you know just looking at
 

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:02.400
and for data you know just looking at
the need for interdisciplinary work for

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:02.410
the need for interdisciplinary work for
 

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:04.840
the need for interdisciplinary work for
making more rapid progress you know not

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:04.850
making more rapid progress you know not
 

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:07.090
making more rapid progress you know not
having it locked up for 70 years and so

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:07.100
having it locked up for 70 years and so
 

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.940
having it locked up for 70 years and so
forth it should read reduce duplication

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:09.950
forth it should read reduce duplication
 

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:12.910
forth it should read reduce duplication
of efforts and in fact that's actually

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:12.920
of efforts and in fact that's actually
 

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:15.430
of efforts and in fact that's actually
one of the drivers for research funders

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440
one of the drivers for research funders
 

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.280
one of the drivers for research funders
to actually want to invest in this type

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:18.290
to actually want to invest in this type
 

00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:19.900
to actually want to invest in this type
of approach because what they see is a

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:19.910
of approach because what they see is a
 

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:22.270
of approach because what they see is a
lot of duplication when data is locked

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:22.280
lot of duplication when data is locked
 

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:26.350
lot of duplication when data is locked
up and not shared and broader community

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:26.360
up and not shared and broader community
 

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.240
up and not shared and broader community
participation I mean I think one of the

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:28.250
participation I mean I think one of the
 

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:31.510
participation I mean I think one of the
amazing things about looking at the

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:31.520
amazing things about looking at the
 

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.130
amazing things about looking at the
Creative Commons experiences is the

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:33.140
Creative Commons experiences is the
 

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:34.630
Creative Commons experiences is the
people from outside the traditional

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640
people from outside the traditional
 

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.060
people from outside the traditional
community come in and contribute and do

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:37.070
community come in and contribute and do
 

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:39.610
community come in and contribute and do
stuff then put in labor and develop code

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:39.620
stuff then put in labor and develop code
 

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:42.550
stuff then put in labor and develop code
and so forth and scientists there are a

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:42.560
and so forth and scientists there are a
 

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.980
and so forth and scientists there are a
lot of examples of participatory science

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:44.990
lot of examples of participatory science
 

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:46.840
lot of examples of participatory science
but this is one where you could imagine

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:46.850
but this is one where you could imagine
 

00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:49.390
but this is one where you could imagine
even more applications just because

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:49.400
even more applications just because
 

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.240
even more applications just because
people like polar bears are or are

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:52.250
people like polar bears are or are
 

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:55.360
people like polar bears are or are
interested in the topic or whatever and

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:55.370
interested in the topic or whatever and
 

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:57.040
interested in the topic or whatever and
again as I mentioned it's an opportunity

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:57.050
again as I mentioned it's an opportunity
 

00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:59.680
again as I mentioned it's an opportunity
to open up the stewardship problem and

00:42:59.680 --> 00:42:59.690
to open up the stewardship problem and
 

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:01.030
to open up the stewardship problem and
it eliminate at least one of the

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040
it eliminate at least one of the
 

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.360
it eliminate at least one of the
barriers to to the long term stewardship

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:04.370
barriers to to the long term stewardship
 

00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:08.250
barriers to to the long term stewardship
and preservation issue so thanks

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:08.260
and preservation issue so thanks
 

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:17.720
and preservation issue so thanks
appreciate your thinking about this

out and thank you for inviting me I'm
 

00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:24.810
out and thank you for inviting me I'm
going to describe their research efforts

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:24.820
going to describe their research efforts
 

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:27.120
going to describe their research efforts
of my group as a way of illustrating the

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:27.130
of my group as a way of illustrating the
 

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:29.520
of my group as a way of illustrating the
issues we face with open data and what

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:29.530
issues we face with open data and what
 

00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:32.130
issues we face with open data and what
you're going to hear is much more

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:32.140
you're going to hear is much more
 

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:34.680
you're going to hear is much more
chaotic and idiosyncratic and

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:34.690
chaotic and idiosyncratic and
 

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:38.730
chaotic and idiosyncratic and
disorganized data issues and anything

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:38.740
disorganized data issues and anything
 

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:40.320
disorganized data issues and anything
that my two colleagues have presented

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:40.330
that my two colleagues have presented
 

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:42.859
that my two colleagues have presented
which have been efforts to sort of have

00:43:42.859 --> 00:43:42.869
which have been efforts to sort of have
 

00:43:42.869 --> 00:43:45.540
which have been efforts to sort of have
organization and principles and what

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:45.550
organization and principles and what
 

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:48.329
organization and principles and what
we're encountering is in many ways the

00:43:48.329 --> 00:43:48.339
we're encountering is in many ways the
 

00:43:48.339 --> 00:43:52.320
we're encountering is in many ways the
opposite of that and so a lot of what I

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:52.330
opposite of that and so a lot of what I
 

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:54.870
opposite of that and so a lot of what I
do is consider how neighborhoods

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:54.880
do is consider how neighborhoods
 

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:57.210
do is consider how neighborhoods
influence the health of their residents

00:43:57.210 --> 00:43:57.220
influence the health of their residents
 

00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.349
influence the health of their residents
and how the characteristics of

00:43:58.349 --> 00:43:58.359
and how the characteristics of
 

00:43:58.359 --> 00:44:01.589
and how the characteristics of
neighborhoods influence the health and

00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:01.599
neighborhoods influence the health and
 

00:44:01.599 --> 00:44:03.480
neighborhoods influence the health and
we're working with this notion of the

everything in New York City has been

00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:44.440
everything in New York City has been
 

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:47.520
everything in New York City has been
built even the parks have been built and

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:47.530
built even the parks have been built and
 

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:50.070
built even the parks have been built and
so what my team is doing we're

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:50.080
so what my team is doing we're
 

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.690
so what my team is doing we're
investigating whether differences in the

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:51.700
investigating whether differences in the
 

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:52.940
investigating whether differences in the
built and the social environment

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:52.950
built and the social environment
 

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:55.650

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:57.240
characteristics of neighborhoods impacts
the health of the residents of the

00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:57.250
the health of the residents of the
 

00:44:57.250 --> 00:45:00.660
the health of the residents of the
neighborhoods and so what we do on a

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:00.670
neighborhoods and so what we do on a
 

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:02.849
neighborhoods and so what we do on a
very very large scale is is simply this

00:45:02.849 --> 00:45:02.859
very very large scale is is simply this
 

00:45:02.859 --> 00:45:05.579
very very large scale is is simply this
we have study subjects from research

00:45:05.579 --> 00:45:05.589
we have study subjects from research
 

00:45:05.589 --> 00:45:07.650
we have study subjects from research
studies where we know something about

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:07.660
studies where we know something about
 

00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:09.630
studies where we know something about
where they live and then we describe

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:09.640
where they live and then we describe
 

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:12.359
where they live and then we describe
their neighborhoods and so this is a map

00:45:12.359 --> 00:45:12.369
their neighborhoods and so this is a map
 

00:45:12.369 --> 00:45:15.690

government information about that must
 

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:26.820
government information about that must
exist in a database so if I want to know

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:26.830
exist in a database so if I want to know
 

00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:28.890

where the elevators are all elevators

00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:28.900
where the elevators are all elevators
 

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.440
where the elevators are all elevators
are inspected every year that means it

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:31.450
are inspected every year that means it
 

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:33.120
are inspected every year that means it
must be a database somewhere that tells

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:33.130
must be a database somewhere that tells

theoretically and know which buildings
 

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:42.030
theoretically and know which buildings
of elevators and so we take this basic

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:42.040
of elevators and so we take this basic
 

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.290

utilize that to find data that we can

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:45.130
utilize that to find data that we can
 

00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:47.910
utilize that to find data that we can
use to describe neighborhoods and we

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:47.920
use to describe neighborhoods and we
 

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:49.500
use to describe neighborhoods and we
have human data that we've collected

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:49.510
have human data that we've collected

their administrative data sets and we
 

00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:00.270
their administrative data sets and we
use the GIS system to create metrics

00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:00.280
use the GIS system to create metrics
 

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:02.310
use the GIS system to create metrics
about what a study subjects neighborhood

00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:02.320
about what a study subjects neighborhood
 

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:05.070
about what a study subjects neighborhood
looks like and so we do a lot of work on

00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:05.080
looks like and so we do a lot of work on
 

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:06.600
looks like and so we do a lot of work on
obesity and I'll show you a several

00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:23.520
activity so that's physical activity and
provides a means where you don't need a

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:23.530
provides a means where you don't need a
 

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:25.830
provides a means where you don't need a
private automobile so driving a car is

00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:25.840
private automobile so driving a car is
 

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:28.110
private automobile so driving a car is
essentially sedentary behavior you burn

00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:28.120
essentially sedentary behavior you burn
 

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.210
essentially sedentary behavior you burn
very very few counter calories in the

00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:30.220
very very few counter calories in the
 

00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:31.410
very very few counter calories in the
car so if you could be car independent

00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:31.420
car so if you could be car independent
 

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:32.730
car so if you could be car independent
you're going to be more physically

00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:32.740
you're going to be more physically
 

00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:35.760
you're going to be more physically
active obviously we're interested in the

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:35.770
active obviously we're interested in the
 

00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:37.500

food environment availability of fast

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:37.510
food environment availability of fast
 

00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:39.630

food supermarkets fruit and vegetable

00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:39.640
food supermarkets fruit and vegetable
 

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.310
food supermarkets fruit and vegetable
markets we're interested in the

00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:41.320
markets we're interested in the
 

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.470
markets we're interested in the
recreational environment you know access

00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:43.480
recreational environment you know access
 

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:46.350
recreational environment you know access
and quality of parks and ball fields the

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:46.360
and quality of parks and ball fields the
 

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.090
and quality of parks and ball fields the
availability of commercial recreation

00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:48.100
availability of commercial recreation
 

00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:50.970
availability of commercial recreation
exercise facilities and so we've done a

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:50.980
exercise facilities and so we've done a
 

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:52.590
exercise facilities and so we've done a
number of studies looking at how the

00:48:52.590 --> 00:48:52.600
number of studies looking at how the
 

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.510
number of studies looking at how the
characteristics of neighborhoods

00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:54.520
characteristics of neighborhoods
 

00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:57.120
characteristics of neighborhoods
influence the obesity or the BMI of

00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:57.130
influence the obesity or the BMI of
 

00:48:57.130 --> 00:48:58.830
influence the obesity or the BMI of
their residents and so we have a study

00:48:58.830 --> 00:48:58.840
their residents and so we have a study
 

00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:01.260
their residents and so we have a study
of 13,000 individuals and we've been

00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:01.270
of 13,000 individuals and we've been
 

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:02.610
of 13,000 individuals and we've been
working with this idea of walkability

00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:02.620
working with this idea of walkability
 

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:04.530
working with this idea of walkability
and we wanted to come up with a metric

00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:04.540
and we wanted to come up with a metric
 

00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:08.040
and we wanted to come up with a metric
of access to public transit and so here

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:08.050
of access to public transit and so here
 

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:10.170
of access to public transit and so here
you see a graph of increasing access to

00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:10.180
you see a graph of increasing access to
 

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:13.140
you see a graph of increasing access to
public transit and the average BMI of

00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:13.150
public transit and the average BMI of
 

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:15.120
public transit and the average BMI of
our study subjects this is nice downward

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:15.130
our study subjects this is nice downward
 

00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:17.190
our study subjects this is nice downward
trend it represents about a one and a

00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:17.200
trend it represents about a one and a
 

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:20.250
trend it represents about a one and a
half one of the third BMI units which

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:20.260
half one of the third BMI units which
 

00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:22.500
half one of the third BMI units which
spread out over the population of New

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:22.510
spread out over the population of New
 

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:24.660
spread out over the population of New
York City would radically change the

00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:24.670
York City would radically change the
 

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:26.370
York City would radically change the
obesity epidemic in New York City if you

00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:26.380
obesity epidemic in New York City if you
 

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:28.500
obesity epidemic in New York City if you
subtracted about one of the third BMI

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:28.510
subtracted about one of the third BMI
 

00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:32.220
subtracted about one of the third BMI
units and so our metric of access to

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:32.230
units and so our metric of access to
 

00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:34.800
units and so our metric of access to
public transit is the census variable

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:34.810
public transit is the census variable
 

00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:36.660
public transit is the census variable
the percent of the population commuting

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:36.670
the percent of the population commuting
 

00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:39.450
the percent of the population commuting
by public transit and so we can easily

00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:39.460
by public transit and so we can easily
 

00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:41.310
by public transit and so we can easily
down that a load that from the Census

00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:41.320
down that a load that from the Census
 

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.170
down that a load that from the Census
Bureau without any problems we can

00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:43.180
Bureau without any problems we can
 

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:44.580
Bureau without any problems we can
create neighborhood measures that tell

00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:44.590
create neighborhood measures that tell
 

00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:46.050
create neighborhood measures that tell
us how many people in each neighborhood

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:46.060
us how many people in each neighborhood
 

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:51.780

very very difficult it's so difficult in
the end that we actually just bought a

00:50:27.759 --> 00:50:27.769
the end that we actually just bought a

the end that we actually just bought a
commercial database for thirty thousand

00:50:29.589 --> 00:50:29.599
commercial database for thirty thousand
 

00:50:29.599 --> 00:50:31.690
commercial database for thirty thousand
dollars that is used for marketing

00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:31.700
dollars that is used for marketing
 

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:33.549
dollars that is used for marketing
purposes but tells us where all the

00:50:33.549 --> 00:50:33.559
purposes but tells us where all the
 

00:50:33.559 --> 00:50:35.829
purposes but tells us where all the
businesses are in New York City and so

00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839
businesses are in New York City and so
 

00:50:35.839 --> 00:50:38.140
businesses are in New York City and so
we ended up instead of just getting data

00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:38.150
we ended up instead of just getting data
 

00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:40.120
we ended up instead of just getting data
that should have been available from the

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:40.130
that should have been available from the
 

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:42.430
that should have been available from the
city government spending a lot of money

00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:42.440
city government spending a lot of money
 

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:46.479
city government spending a lot of money
to buy the data and this information is

00:50:46.479 --> 00:50:46.489
to buy the data and this information is
 

00:50:46.489 --> 00:50:48.759
to buy the data and this information is
now actually underlying changes in the

00:50:48.759 --> 00:50:48.769
now actually underlying changes in the
 

00:50:48.769 --> 00:50:50.559
now actually underlying changes in the
zoning in New York City so there are

00:50:50.559 --> 00:50:50.569
zoning in New York City so there are
 

00:50:50.569 --> 00:50:51.819
zoning in New York City so there are
neighborhoods New York City where you

00:50:51.819 --> 00:50:51.829
neighborhoods New York City where you
 

00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:54.400
neighborhoods New York City where you
cannot buy fresh fruits and vegetables

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:54.410
cannot buy fresh fruits and vegetables
 

00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:55.870
cannot buy fresh fruits and vegetables
there are no produce markets there's no

00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:55.880
there are no produce markets there's no
 

00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:57.880
there are no produce markets there's no
supermarkets there's no grocery stores

00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:57.890
supermarkets there's no grocery stores
 

00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:59.799
supermarkets there's no grocery stores
and so they're changing the zoning to

00:50:59.799 --> 00:50:59.809
and so they're changing the zoning to
 

00:50:59.809 --> 00:51:01.839
and so they're changing the zoning to
make it easier for supermarkets and

00:51:01.839 --> 00:51:01.849
make it easier for supermarkets and
 

00:51:01.849 --> 00:51:03.309
make it easier for supermarkets and
produce markets to open up in these

00:51:03.309 --> 00:51:03.319
produce markets to open up in these
 

00:51:03.319 --> 00:51:04.809
produce markets to open up in these
neighborhoods like in central Brooklyn

00:51:04.809 --> 00:51:04.819
neighborhoods like in central Brooklyn
 

00:51:04.819 --> 00:51:07.539
neighborhoods like in central Brooklyn
where you get candy fried chicken but

00:51:07.539 --> 00:51:07.549
where you get candy fried chicken but
 

00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:11.259
where you get candy fried chicken but
you can't buy a banana and so this these

00:51:11.259 --> 00:51:11.269
you can't buy a banana and so this these
 

00:51:11.269 --> 00:51:12.759
you can't buy a banana and so this these
results are being used as part of the

scientific basis for changing parts of
 

00:51:15.799 --> 00:51:19.479
scientific basis for changing parts of
the zoning regulation here's a similar

00:51:19.479 --> 00:51:19.489
the zoning regulation here's a similar
 

00:51:19.489 --> 00:51:21.939
the zoning regulation here's a similar

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:24.920
health food healthy food sources data
 

00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:27.390
health food healthy food sources data
and we combined it with data from

00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:27.400
and we combined it with data from
 

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:31.449
and we combined it with data from
200,000 New York City births in 2001 and

00:51:31.449 --> 00:51:31.459
200,000 New York City births in 2001 and
 

00:51:31.459 --> 00:51:33.400
200,000 New York City births in 2001 and
what we're looking at is the odds of

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:33.410
what we're looking at is the odds of
 

00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:35.979
what we're looking at is the odds of
maternal obesity and what you see is as

00:51:35.979 --> 00:51:35.989
maternal obesity and what you see is as
 

00:51:35.989 --> 00:51:37.870
maternal obesity and what you see is as
the number of healthy food sources

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:37.880
the number of healthy food sources
 

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:40.630
the number of healthy food sources
increases the odds of maternal obesity

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640
increases the odds of maternal obesity
 

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:44.079
increases the odds of maternal obesity
significantly decreases and this data is

00:51:44.079 --> 00:51:44.089
significantly decreases and this data is
 

00:51:44.089 --> 00:51:46.299
significantly decreases and this data is
this graph relies on data from the

00:51:46.299 --> 00:51:46.309
this graph relies on data from the
 

00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:48.370
this graph relies on data from the
Department of Health's vital statistics

00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:48.380
Department of Health's vital statistics
 

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:50.499
Department of Health's vital statistics
and so the Department of Health

00:51:50.499 --> 00:51:50.509
and so the Department of Health
 

00:51:50.509 --> 00:51:52.870
and so the Department of Health
maintains information on all deaths and

00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880
maintains information on all deaths and
 

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:55.660

go pick it up and plant a new tree so I

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:11.130
go pick it up and plant a new tree so I
 

00:55:11.130 --> 00:55:13.430

00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:31.550
lower prevalence of asthma and so New
York City is about to plant a million

00:55:31.550 --> 00:55:31.560
York City is about to plant a million
 

00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:34.610
York City is about to plant a million
new trees on the streets and so this

00:55:34.610 --> 00:55:34.620
new trees on the streets and so this
 

00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:36.740
new trees on the streets and so this
kind of information is very helpful for

00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:36.750
kind of information is very helpful for
 

00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:38.660
kind of information is very helpful for
them in thinking about where they going

00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:38.670
them in thinking about where they going
 

00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:41.360

to plant trees the u.s. Forest Service

00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:41.370
to plant trees the u.s. Forest Service
 

00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:43.730
to plant trees the u.s. Forest Service
has just given us a big grant to really

00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:43.740
has just given us a big grant to really
 

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:45.860
has just given us a big grant to really
study why it is that trees may prevent

00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:45.870
study why it is that trees may prevent
 

00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:47.780
study why it is that trees may prevent
asthma and so we actually have a

00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:47.790
asthma and so we actually have a
 

00:55:47.790 --> 00:55:49.070
asthma and so we actually have a
partnership with Department of Health

00:55:49.070 --> 00:55:49.080

York City to study foliage and trees and
 

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:56.750
York City to study foliage and trees and
how that might change air pollution

00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:56.760
how that might change air pollution
 

00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:58.940
how that might change air pollution
levels of the microclimate and how that

00:55:58.940 --> 00:55:58.950
levels of the microclimate and how that
 

00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:00.860
levels of the microclimate and how that
might influence asthma and little

00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:00.870
might influence asthma and little

was in fact a Department of Forestry in
 

00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:10.190
was in fact a Department of Forestry in
New York City and then reach an

location these application of the trees
and we just tell us the number of trees

00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:19.350
and we just tell us the number of trees
 

00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:21.410
and we just tell us the number of trees
on each block for some reason the actual

00:59:01.089 --> 00:59:01.099
why they don't let their children go out
 

00:59:01.099 --> 00:59:03.490
why they don't let their children go out
to the parks or the playgrounds the

00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:03.500
to the parks or the playgrounds the
 

00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:06.130
to the parks or the playgrounds the
number one response is it's dangerous in

00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:06.140
number one response is it's dangerous in
 

00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:07.359
number one response is it's dangerous in
my neighborhood there's a lot of crime

00:59:07.359 --> 00:59:07.369
my neighborhood there's a lot of crime
 

00:59:07.369 --> 00:59:10.180
my neighborhood there's a lot of crime
and so we want to test whether or not

00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:10.190
and so we want to test whether or not
 

00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:12.220
and so we want to test whether or not
crime has got an influence on physical

00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:12.230
crime has got an influence on physical
 

00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:14.260
crime has got an influence on physical
activities that we want crime statistics

00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:14.270
activities that we want crime statistics
 

00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:15.820
activities that we want crime statistics
from the police department to match up

00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:15.830
from the police department to match up
 

00:59:15.830 --> 00:59:19.210
from the police department to match up
with our human subjects and for years

00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:19.220
with our human subjects and for years
 

00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:20.260
with our human subjects and for years
and years and years the police

00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:20.270
and years and years the police
 

00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:22.060
and years and years the police
department has refused to give us even

00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:22.070
department has refused to give us even
 

00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:24.609
department has refused to give us even
just you know at the track level of the

00:59:24.609 --> 00:59:24.619
just you know at the track level of the
 

00:59:24.619 --> 00:59:27.130
just you know at the track level of the
zip code the number of crimes and it's

00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:27.140
zip code the number of crimes and it's
 

00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:31.440
zip code the number of crimes and it's
been continuous blockage on that and

00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:31.450
been continuous blockage on that and
 

00:59:31.450 --> 00:59:34.599
been continuous blockage on that and
getting this data often comes down to my

00:59:34.599 --> 00:59:34.609
getting this data often comes down to my
 

00:59:34.609 --> 00:59:36.640
getting this data often comes down to my
team sitting around saying you know I

team sitting around saying you know I
 

00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:40.230

know a guy I met a guy at a conference

00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:40.240
know a guy I met a guy at a conference
 

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.640
know a guy I met a guy at a conference
you know had drinks with a guy who knows

00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:42.650
you know had drinks with a guy who knows
 

00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:46.030
you know had drinks with a guy who knows
a guy in that agency maybe they can

a guy in that agency maybe they can
 

00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:49.270
a guy in that agency maybe they can
provide us with some kind of in it's

completely not systematic and this is

00:59:50.859 --> 00:59:50.869
completely not systematic and this is
 

00:59:50.869 --> 00:59:52.089
completely not systematic and this is

00:59:52.089 --> 00:59:52.099
data that's collected with our tax
 

00:59:52.099 --> 00:59:54.460

enormous burden to negotiate these kinds

00:59:58.750 --> 00:59:58.760
enormous burden to negotiate these kinds
 

00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:00.430
enormous burden to negotiate these kinds

data and then once you have the data

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:07.670
data and then once you have the data
 

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:09.700
data and then once you have the data
there's this issue of what is my

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:09.710
there's this issue of what is my
 

01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:11.710
there's this issue of what is my
responsibility as the researcher to

01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:11.720
responsibility as the researcher to
 

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.480
responsibility as the researcher to

further disseminate this data to other
 

01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:17.050
further disseminate this data to other
research groups and there's two types of

01:00:17.050 --> 01:00:17.060
research groups and there's two types of
 

01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:19.060
research groups and there's two types of
data there's the raw data and then

01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:19.070
data there's the raw data and then
 

01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:20.770
data there's the raw data and then
there's the valid value added

01:00:20.770 --> 01:00:20.780
there's the valid value added
 

01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:23.050
there's the valid value added
measurements that I have created from

01:00:23.050 --> 01:00:23.060
measurements that I have created from
 

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:24.910
measurements that I have created from
that raw data that represent the

that raw data that represent the
 

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.609
that raw data that represent the
creative manipulation of data or the

layering of multiple data units together
to generate a value added measure and

to generate a value added measure and
 

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.530
to generate a value added measure and

some of our data usage agreements
 

01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:37.870
some of our data usage agreements
prohibited this flat out say we cannot

for my colleagues who work with me so
 

01:01:01.299 --> 01:01:04.650
for my colleagues who work with me so
what is my motivation to share the data

01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:04.660
what is my motivation to share the data
 

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:08.279
what is my motivation to share the data
that I've created or licensed or spent

01:01:08.279 --> 01:01:08.289
that I've created or licensed or spent
 

01:01:08.289 --> 01:01:10.200
that I've created or licensed or spent
days and days they schmoozing to get

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:10.210
days and days they schmoozing to get
 

01:01:10.210 --> 01:01:12.539

with another research group you know

01:01:12.539 --> 01:01:12.549
with another research group you know
 

01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:14.519
with another research group you know
when I went out for my last promotion we

01:01:14.519 --> 01:01:14.529
when I went out for my last promotion we
 

01:01:14.529 --> 01:01:16.349
when I went out for my last promotion we
talked about my publications my teaching

01:01:16.349 --> 01:01:16.359
talked about my publications my teaching
 

01:01:16.359 --> 01:01:19.049
talked about my publications my teaching
record never once did anybody suggest to

01:01:19.049 --> 01:01:19.059
record never once did anybody suggest to
 

01:01:19.059 --> 01:01:21.779
record never once did anybody suggest to
me that you know i would get credit for

01:01:21.779 --> 01:01:21.789
me that you know i would get credit for
 

01:01:21.789 --> 01:01:23.420
me that you know i would get credit for
depositing data in the library or

01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:23.430
depositing data in the library or
 

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:25.440
depositing data in the library or
sharing the data with another research

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:25.450
sharing the data with another research
 

01:01:25.450 --> 01:01:27.420
sharing the data with another research
group it's not part of the reward

01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:27.430
group it's not part of the reward
 

01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:29.309
group it's not part of the reward
structure under which we're operating

01:01:29.309 --> 01:01:29.319
structure under which we're operating
 

01:01:29.319 --> 01:01:32.910
structure under which we're operating
and so it's this disincentive for me to

01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:32.920
and so it's this disincentive for me to
 

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:35.789
and so it's this disincentive for me to
share it and then once i do share it cuz

01:01:35.789 --> 01:01:35.799
share it and then once i do share it cuz
 

01:01:35.799 --> 01:01:37.319
share it and then once i do share it cuz
i often actually do share my data with

01:01:37.319 --> 01:01:37.329
i often actually do share my data with
 

01:01:37.329 --> 01:01:39.960
i often actually do share my data with
other research groups managing and

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:39.970
other research groups managing and
 

01:01:39.970 --> 01:01:41.849
other research groups managing and
monitoring how that information is

01:01:41.849 --> 01:01:41.859
monitoring how that information is
 

01:01:41.859 --> 01:01:45.210
monitoring how that information is
disseminated is a huge burden is it

01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:45.220
disseminated is a huge burden is it
 

01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:47.880
disseminated is a huge burden is it
being used within the structures of the

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:47.890
being used within the structures of the
 

01:01:47.890 --> 01:01:49.680
being used within the structures of the
licensing agreement that i originally

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:49.690
licensing agreement that i originally
 

01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:52.740
licensing agreement that i originally
signed is it being used within the

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:52.750
signed is it being used within the
 

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:54.870
signed is it being used within the
confines of the agreement i have with

01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:54.880
confines of the agreement i have with
 

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.339
confines of the agreement i have with
the other researcher for they're going

01:01:56.339 --> 01:01:56.349
the other researcher for they're going
 

01:01:56.349 --> 01:01:59.009
the other researcher for they're going
to use the data for and so we spend an

01:01:59.009 --> 01:01:59.019
to use the data for and so we spend an
 

01:01:59.019 --> 01:02:01.920
to use the data for and so we spend an
awful lot of time just sort of managing

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:01.930
awful lot of time just sort of managing
 

01:02:01.930 --> 01:02:03.630
awful lot of time just sort of managing
the flow of information that we've

01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:03.640
the flow of information that we've
 

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:07.319
the flow of information that we've
created to other groups and i recently

01:02:07.319 --> 01:02:07.329
created to other groups and i recently
 

01:02:07.329 --> 01:02:10.920
created to other groups and i recently
had the i recently found out that I had

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:10.930
had the i recently found out that I had
 

01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:13.440
had the i recently found out that I had
given data that we had created from sort

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:13.450
given data that we had created from sort
 

01:02:13.450 --> 01:02:16.019
given data that we had created from sort
of value-added measures to another

01:02:16.019 --> 01:02:16.029
of value-added measures to another
 

01:02:16.029 --> 01:02:18.029
of value-added measures to another
institution to work on a project we

01:02:18.029 --> 01:02:18.039
institution to work on a project we
 

01:02:18.039 --> 01:02:19.499
institution to work on a project we
wrote a nice paper together it was a

01:02:19.499 --> 01:02:19.509
wrote a nice paper together it was a
 

01:02:19.509 --> 01:02:21.749
wrote a nice paper together it was a
great relationship and then later on

01:02:21.749 --> 01:02:21.759
great relationship and then later on
 

01:02:21.759 --> 01:02:23.910
great relationship and then later on
other researchers at the institution I

01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:23.920
other researchers at the institution I
 

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:26.039
other researchers at the institution I
guess came across text describing the

01:02:26.039 --> 01:02:26.049
guess came across text describing the
 

01:02:26.049 --> 01:02:27.569
guess came across text describing the
data and the fact that it was on their

01:02:27.569 --> 01:02:27.579
data and the fact that it was on their
 

01:02:27.579 --> 01:02:29.430
data and the fact that it was on their
hard drives wrote a grant proposal

01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440
hard drives wrote a grant proposal
 

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:31.109
hard drives wrote a grant proposal
saying they were going to use these

01:02:31.109 --> 01:02:31.119
saying they were going to use these
 

01:02:31.119 --> 01:02:33.779
saying they were going to use these
measures and this data subsequently got

01:02:33.779 --> 01:02:33.789
measures and this data subsequently got
 

01:02:33.789 --> 01:02:36.089
measures and this data subsequently got
the grant proposal and then called us up

01:02:36.089 --> 01:02:36.099
the grant proposal and then called us up
 

01:02:36.099 --> 01:02:38.099
the grant proposal and then called us up
and said all right so can we have that

01:02:38.099 --> 01:02:38.109
and said all right so can we have that
 

01:02:38.109 --> 01:02:40.049
and said all right so can we have that
data you have and could you tell us how

01:02:40.049 --> 01:02:40.059
data you have and could you tell us how
 

01:02:40.059 --> 01:02:43.109
data you have and could you tell us how
to use it and what you do with it and

01:02:43.109 --> 01:02:43.119
to use it and what you do with it and
 

01:02:43.119 --> 01:02:46.680
to use it and what you do with it and
I'm on the phone going what and so the

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:46.690
I'm on the phone going what and so the
 

01:02:46.690 --> 01:02:48.960
I'm on the phone going what and so the
question is is there some central role

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:48.970
question is is there some central role
 

01:02:48.970 --> 01:02:52.109
question is is there some central role
at columbia for kind of managing this

01:02:52.109 --> 01:02:52.119
at columbia for kind of managing this
 

01:02:52.119 --> 01:02:54.660
at columbia for kind of managing this
kind of administrative geospatial data

01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:54.670
kind of administrative geospatial data
 

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:57.120
kind of administrative geospatial data
in an organized manner because it

01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:57.130
in an organized manner because it
 

01:02:57.130 --> 01:03:01.230
in an organized manner because it
moment you know it's not chaos but it's

01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:01.240
moment you know it's not chaos but it's
 

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:05.039
moment you know it's not chaos but it's
really disorganized and it's slowing

01:03:05.039 --> 01:03:05.049
really disorganized and it's slowing
 

01:03:05.049 --> 01:03:06.390
really disorganized and it's slowing
down research and this is the kind of

01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400
down research and this is the kind of
 

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.099
down research and this is the kind of
research that actually the city then

01:03:08.099 --> 01:03:08.109
research that actually the city then
 

01:03:08.109 --> 01:03:11.160
research that actually the city then
uses to set policy make decisions so

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:11.170
uses to set policy make decisions so
 

01:03:11.170 --> 01:03:13.380
uses to set policy make decisions so
this is like real world public health

01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:13.390
this is like real world public health
 

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:15.120
this is like real world public health
where we find something out and an

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:15.130
where we find something out and an
 

01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:17.849
where we find something out and an
agency makes a change you know to make

01:03:17.849 --> 01:03:17.859
agency makes a change you know to make
 

01:03:17.859 --> 01:03:19.589
agency makes a change you know to make
fruits and vegetables available and so

01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:19.599
fruits and vegetables available and so
 

01:03:19.599 --> 01:03:22.319
fruits and vegetables available and so
this is slowing things down and I don't

01:03:22.319 --> 01:03:22.329
this is slowing things down and I don't
 

01:03:22.329 --> 01:03:23.609
this is slowing things down and I don't
know what the solution is but I've been

01:03:23.609 --> 01:03:23.619
know what the solution is but I've been
 

01:03:23.619 --> 01:03:25.529
know what the solution is but I've been
talking to people the population center

01:03:25.529 --> 01:03:25.539
talking to people the population center
 

01:03:25.539 --> 01:03:28.440
talking to people the population center
here at Columbia about maybe they should

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:28.450
here at Columbia about maybe they should
 

01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:31.859
here at Columbia about maybe they should
have a role in sort of managing and

01:03:31.859 --> 01:03:31.869
have a role in sort of managing and
 

01:03:31.869 --> 01:03:34.859
have a role in sort of managing and
coordinating all of this flow of data

01:03:34.859 --> 01:03:34.869
coordinating all of this flow of data
 

01:03:34.869 --> 01:03:36.599
coordinating all of this flow of data
that we've been amassing over the last

01:03:36.599 --> 01:03:36.609
that we've been amassing over the last
 

01:03:36.609 --> 01:03:39.599
that we've been amassing over the last
six or seven years and so those are my

01:03:39.599 --> 01:03:39.609
six or seven years and so those are my
 

01:03:39.609 --> 01:03:42.390
six or seven years and so those are my
thoughts about this and this is what

01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:42.400
thoughts about this and this is what
 

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.769
thoughts about this and this is what
I've described here is a lot less

01:03:43.769 --> 01:03:43.779
I've described here is a lot less
 

01:03:43.779 --> 01:03:45.480
I've described here is a lot less
organized than what my colleagues here

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:45.490
organized than what my colleagues here
 

01:03:45.490 --> 01:03:48.839
organized than what my colleagues here
have been working towards and maybe you

01:03:48.839 --> 01:03:48.849
have been working towards and maybe you
 

01:03:48.849 --> 01:03:50.190
have been working towards and maybe you
know up in the public health school were

01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:50.200
know up in the public health school were
 

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:52.710
know up in the public health school were
far behind what they've achieved but now

01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720
far behind what they've achieved but now
 

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:54.539
far behind what they've achieved but now
we're facing these issues and kind of

01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:54.549
we're facing these issues and kind of
 

01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:57.120
we're facing these issues and kind of
like looking for solutions on how to

01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:57.130
like looking for solutions on how to
 

01:03:57.130 --> 01:04:01.230
like looking for solutions on how to
make this data open and usable without

01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:01.240
make this data open and usable without
 

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.089
make this data open and usable without
there being also data anarchy of

there being also data anarchy of
 

01:04:03.099 --> 01:04:05.370
there being also data anarchy of
everybody doing the same thing so thank

everybody doing the same thing so thank
 

01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:11.759
everybody doing the same thing so thank
you for your attention okay so maybe I

could focus and also generalize from two

01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:14.230
could focus and also generalize from two
 

01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:17.160

first talk you made passing reference to
 

01:04:21.069 --> 01:04:22.680
first talk you made passing reference to
code and in particular two different

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:22.690
code and in particular two different
 

01:04:22.690 --> 01:04:23.940
code and in particular two different
licenses on code so there were some

computational scientists code is sort of
 

01:04:38.769 --> 01:04:40.950
computational scientists code is sort of
like the apparatus that you build it is

you did so again code was not in the

01:04:55.589 --> 01:04:55.599
you did so again code was not in the
 

01:04:55.599 --> 01:04:57.089
you did so again code was not in the
title of this session so I'm sorry for

01:04:57.089 --> 01:04:57.099
title of this session so I'm sorry for
 

01:04:57.099 --> 01:04:58.259
title of this session so I'm sorry for
generalizing to code but since you

01:04:58.259 --> 01:04:58.269
generalizing to code but since you
 

01:04:58.269 --> 01:05:00.180
generalizing to code but since you
brought it up maybe you could discuss a

01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:00.190
brought it up maybe you could discuss a
 

01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:02.460
brought it up maybe you could discuss a
bit about how the panelists in general

01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:02.470
bit about how the panelists in general
 

01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:04.829
bit about how the panelists in general
and also Creative Commons thinks about

and also Creative Commons thinks about
 

01:05:04.839 --> 01:05:06.690
and also Creative Commons thinks about

01:05:06.690 --> 01:05:06.700
how code should be distributed also
 

01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:09.080
how code should be distributed also
funding agencies was in the title so

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:09.090
funding agencies was in the title so
 

01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:10.760
funding agencies was in the title so
I'm curious to know what the three of

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:10.770
I'm curious to know what the three of
 

01:05:10.770 --> 01:05:12.080
I'm curious to know what the three of
you think funding agencies should be

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:12.090
you think funding agencies should be
 

01:05:12.090 --> 01:05:13.430
you think funding agencies should be
doing for example right now the policy

01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440
doing for example right now the policy
 

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:15.920
doing for example right now the policy
of funding agencies is play nice so

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:15.930
of funding agencies is play nice so
 

01:05:15.930 --> 01:05:16.940
of funding agencies is play nice so
we're going to give you the dollar now

01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:16.950
we're going to give you the dollar now
 

01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:19.610
we're going to give you the dollar now
under the understanding that after I

01:05:19.610 --> 01:05:19.620
under the understanding that after I
 

01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:21.110
under the understanding that after I
give you the dollar in six months or 12

01:05:21.110 --> 01:05:21.120
give you the dollar in six months or 12
 

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:22.730
give you the dollar in six months or 12
months you'll be nice and there's

01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:22.740
months you'll be nice and there's
 

01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:24.290
months you'll be nice and there's
absolutely no mechanism for enforcing

01:05:24.290 --> 01:05:24.300
absolutely no mechanism for enforcing
 

01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:26.750
absolutely no mechanism for enforcing
that some of the agencies don't even say

01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760
that some of the agencies don't even say
 

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:29.930
that some of the agencies don't even say
that so I'd be curious to know your

01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:29.940
that so I'd be curious to know your
 

01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:30.950
that so I'd be curious to know your
thoughts about code and how it relates

01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960
thoughts about code and how it relates
 

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.240
thoughts about code and how it relates
to what you're discussing the first doc

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:32.250
to what you're discussing the first doc
 

01:05:32.250 --> 01:05:34.130
to what you're discussing the first doc
and also what funding agencies should be

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:34.140
and also what funding agencies should be
 

01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:36.080
and also what funding agencies should be
doing differently to help us all thanks

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:36.090
doing differently to help us all thanks
 

01:05:36.090 --> 01:05:39.230
doing differently to help us all thanks
so the if I could have a theme it would

01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:39.240
so the if I could have a theme it would
 

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:41.320
so the if I could have a theme it would

so free software licenses work really

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:44.910
so free software licenses work really
 

01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:46.790
so free software licenses work really
well for software and so we tend to

01:05:46.790 --> 01:05:46.800
well for software and so we tend to
 

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:48.470
well for software and so we tend to
recommend that you use a software

01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480
recommend that you use a software
 

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:52.000
recommend that you use a software
license for software so we have a

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:52.010
license for software so we have a
 

01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:54.050
license for software so we have a

Victoria stodden who's working on what
we call the reproducible research

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:57.210
we call the reproducible research
 

01:05:57.210 --> 01:05:59.600
we call the reproducible research
standard and essentially the idea is

01:05:59.600 --> 01:05:59.610
standard and essentially the idea is
 

01:05:59.610 --> 01:06:01.160
standard and essentially the idea is
that we would provide a trademark like a

that we would provide a trademark like a
quality brand mark that you could use if

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:03.990
quality brand mark that you could use if
 

01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:06.380
quality brand mark that you could use if
you are a computational researcher and

01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:06.390
you are a computational researcher and
 

01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:08.060
you are a computational researcher and
to get that you would use you would say

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:08.070
to get that you would use you would say
 

01:06:08.070 --> 01:06:09.560
to get that you would use you would say

well so we would not say to put your

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:29.730
well so we would not say to put your

the same reason we recommend using a
 

01:06:39.210 --> 01:06:41.540
the same reason we recommend using a

in terms of funding agencies what we've

01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:47.160
in terms of funding agencies what we've
 

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.610
in terms of funding agencies what we've
seen is that the funders have the most

01:06:49.610 --> 01:06:49.620
seen is that the funders have the most
 

01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:52.850

the data sharing plans are
not part of the peer review process so

small group of people hacking away and
 

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:38.700
small group of people hacking away and
trying to come up with it there's no

01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:38.710
trying to come up with it there's no
 

01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:41.190

and so the systems that we've built that

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:47.110
and so the systems that we've built that
 

01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:48.960
and so the systems that we've built that
work work at the big levels not at the

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:48.970
work work at the big levels not at the
 

01:07:48.970 --> 01:07:50.190
work work at the big levels not at the
small levels and that's why we keep

01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:50.200
small levels and that's why we keep
 

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:51.690
small levels and that's why we keep
talking about the network as a as a

with giant mainframe computers and so we

01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:00.790
with giant mainframe computers and so we
 

01:08:00.790 --> 01:08:02.250
with giant mainframe computers and so we
want a system that allows the polar

01:08:02.250 --> 01:08:02.260
want a system that allows the polar
 

01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:03.750
want a system that allows the polar
information Commons but also allows

01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:03.760

always had a data plan paragraph you're

01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:24.520
always had a data plan paragraph you're
 

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:25.980
always had a data plan paragraph you're
supposed to put in there but seems

01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:25.990

you know how do you label it what's how

01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:01.030
you know how do you label it what's how

do you do versioning how do you find it

01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:02.950
do you do versioning how do you find it
 

01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:04.349
do you do versioning how do you find it
so there are a lot of people

01:09:04.349 --> 01:09:04.359
so there are a lot of people
 

01:09:04.359 --> 01:09:06.450
so there are a lot of people
experimenting with persistent

they were a publication or something but
then you need a whole quality review

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:23.650
then you need a whole quality review
 

01:09:23.650 --> 01:09:25.559
then you need a whole quality review
process structure that's comparable to a

process structure that's comparable to a
 

01:09:25.569 --> 01:09:28.590
process structure that's comparable to a
scientific paper and you need you know

01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:28.600
scientific paper and you need you know
 

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.720

lot of discussions about this in
 

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.550
lot of discussions about this in
different fields you know different

01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560
different fields you know different
 

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:43.680

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640
sharing of the geospatial data that I
 

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:02.550
sharing of the geospatial data that I
have it's never really been discussed

01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560
have it's never really been discussed
 

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:04.080
have it's never really been discussed
and we've been operating basically on

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:04.090
and we've been operating basically on
 

01:10:04.090 --> 01:10:08.190
and we've been operating basically on
your play nice idea and so I share the

01:10:08.190 --> 01:10:08.200
your play nice idea and so I share the
 

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:11.070
your play nice idea and so I share the
geospatial data I have with people I

01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:11.080
geospatial data I have with people I
 

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:12.870

actually further ahead i think on this

01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:23.110
actually further ahead i think on this
 

01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:25.700
actually further ahead i think on this
idea and so they've been pushing

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:25.710
idea and so they've been pushing
 

01:10:25.710 --> 01:10:28.110
idea and so they've been pushing
standardization of data and

01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:28.120
standardization of data and
 

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:30.300
standardization of data and
centralization and sharing of data so

01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:30.310
centralization and sharing of data so
 

01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:32.990
centralization and sharing of data so
that we can do a study of New York City

01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:33.000
that we can do a study of New York City
 

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.920

hasn't ended I had a series of meetings
 

01:11:02.410 --> 01:11:06.570
hasn't ended I had a series of meetings
coming up I've had a meeting to express

01:11:06.570 --> 01:11:06.580
coming up I've had a meeting to express
 

01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:09.120
coming up I've had a meeting to express
the unacceptable nature of this and i

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:09.130
the unacceptable nature of this and i
 

01:11:09.130 --> 01:11:11.640
the unacceptable nature of this and i
have a meeting coming up to come to a

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:11.650
have a meeting coming up to come to a
 

01:11:11.650 --> 01:11:13.980
have a meeting coming up to come to a
solution whereby I mean the project that

01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:13.990
solution whereby I mean the project that
 

01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:15.150
solution whereby I mean the project that
they're going to do is actually really

01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:15.160
they're going to do is actually really
 

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:18.660
they're going to do is actually really
great but a way of going about you know

01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:18.670
great but a way of going about you know
 

01:11:18.670 --> 01:11:21.660
great but a way of going about you know
being a colleague was not so great and

01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:21.670
being a colleague was not so great and
 

01:11:21.670 --> 01:11:23.130
being a colleague was not so great and
so I want the project to go forward

01:11:23.130 --> 01:11:23.140
so I want the project to go forward
 

01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:24.000
so I want the project to go forward
because I think it would be very useful

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:24.010
because I think it would be very useful
 

01:11:24.010 --> 01:11:27.630
because I think it would be very useful
but we need a way to work together

01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:27.640
but we need a way to work together
 

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:31.410
but we need a way to work together
whereby there's some there's an

01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:31.420
whereby there's some there's an
 

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.300
whereby there's some there's an
equitable relationship so you wish to

01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:33.310
equitable relationship so you wish to
 

01:11:33.310 --> 01:11:36.180
equitable relationship so you wish to
execute a degree of control I don't know

01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:36.190
execute a degree of control I don't know
 

01:11:36.190 --> 01:11:37.620
execute a degree of control I don't know
if I want to execute a degree of control

01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:37.630
if I want to execute a degree of control
 

01:11:37.630 --> 01:11:38.439
if I want to execute a degree of control
but the

01:11:38.439 --> 01:11:38.449
but the
 

01:11:38.449 --> 01:11:41.229
but the
the things they promised to do aren't

01:11:41.229 --> 01:11:41.239
the things they promised to do aren't

legal under the licenses for the data I
 

01:11:43.039 --> 01:11:46.209
legal under the licenses for the data I
have and so I can't actually give up the

01:11:46.209 --> 01:11:46.219
have and so I can't actually give up the
 

01:11:46.219 --> 01:11:49.149
have and so I can't actually give up the
data so the kinds of information they

01:11:49.149 --> 01:11:49.159
data so the kinds of information they
 

01:11:49.159 --> 01:11:52.060
data so the kinds of information they
want have to be generated at Columbia by

01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:52.070
want have to be generated at Columbia by
 

01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:54.370
want have to be generated at Columbia by
people of my team who are allowed to

01:11:54.370 --> 01:11:54.380
people of my team who are allowed to
 

01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:56.620
people of my team who are allowed to
generate that kind of information and in

01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:56.630
generate that kind of information and in
 

01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:58.750
generate that kind of information and in
that the raw data can't be moved but the

01:11:58.750 --> 01:11:58.760
that the raw data can't be moved but the
 

01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:02.410
that the raw data can't be moved but the
derived variables can be moved but you

01:12:02.410 --> 01:12:02.420
derived variables can be moved but you
 

01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:05.680
derived variables can be moved but you
know they're now basically saying my

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:05.690
know they're now basically saying my
 

01:12:05.690 --> 01:12:07.299
know they're now basically saying my
team has to invest a lot of time and

01:12:07.299 --> 01:12:07.309
team has to invest a lot of time and
 

01:12:07.309 --> 01:12:09.939
team has to invest a lot of time and
energy and percent effort to generate

01:12:09.939 --> 01:12:09.949
energy and percent effort to generate
 

01:12:09.949 --> 01:12:12.430
energy and percent effort to generate
variables so we're going to find a way

01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:12.440
variables so we're going to find a way
 

01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:14.919
variables so we're going to find a way
to go forward make that happen right but

01:12:14.919 --> 01:12:14.929
to go forward make that happen right but
 

01:12:14.929 --> 01:12:17.319
to go forward make that happen right but
it's not this is not a system that is

01:12:17.319 --> 01:12:17.329
it's not this is not a system that is
 

01:12:17.329 --> 01:12:20.739
it's not this is not a system that is
sustainable for the next ten ro ones

01:12:20.739 --> 01:12:20.749
sustainable for the next ten ro ones
 

01:12:20.749 --> 01:12:22.899
sustainable for the next ten ro ones
that go in our next ten research

01:12:22.899 --> 01:12:22.909
that go in our next ten research
 

01:12:22.909 --> 01:12:29.680
that go in our next ten research
projects that go in I hesitate to ask

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:29.690
projects that go in I hesitate to ask
 

01:12:29.690 --> 01:12:31.689
projects that go in I hesitate to ask
this question with Jeremiah right next

01:12:31.689 --> 01:12:31.699
this question with Jeremiah right next
 

01:12:31.699 --> 01:12:35.020
this question with Jeremiah right next
to me but I just want to pick up on your

01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:35.030
to me but I just want to pick up on your
 

01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:38.620
to me but I just want to pick up on your
issue about a centralized place at

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:38.630
issue about a centralized place at
 

01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:54.549
issue about a centralized place at
Columbia to manage

01:12:54.549 --> 01:12:54.559
 

01:12:54.559 --> 01:13:00.970
like the days of yore creating

01:13:00.970 --> 01:13:00.980
 

01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:04.640
provenance over the data so it's very

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:04.650
provenance over the data so it's very
 

01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:07.069
provenance over the data so it's very
hard to publish a paper where you

01:13:07.069 --> 01:13:07.079
hard to publish a paper where you
 

01:13:07.079 --> 01:13:10.759
hard to publish a paper where you
explain how somebody at some agency gave

01:13:10.759 --> 01:13:10.769
explain how somebody at some agency gave
 

01:13:10.769 --> 01:13:13.250
explain how somebody at some agency gave
use of data and that's the end of the

01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:13.260
use of data and that's the end of the
 

01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:15.859
use of data and that's the end of the
description we need to have a trail of

01:13:15.859 --> 01:13:15.869
description we need to have a trail of
 

01:13:15.869 --> 01:13:17.870
description we need to have a trail of
like the problems of how the information

01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:17.880
like the problems of how the information
 

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:20.959
like the problems of how the information
was created the agency level what year

01:13:20.959 --> 01:13:20.969
was created the agency level what year
 

01:13:20.969 --> 01:13:23.569
was created the agency level what year
it represents what parts the city a

01:13:23.569 --> 01:13:23.579
it represents what parts the city a
 

01:13:23.579 --> 01:13:24.919
it represents what parts the city a
represents it has to have all this

01:13:24.919 --> 01:13:24.929
represents it has to have all this
 

01:13:24.929 --> 01:13:26.660
represents it has to have all this
metadata associated with it that

01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:26.670
metadata associated with it that
 

01:13:26.670 --> 01:13:30.049
metadata associated with it that
basically described its problems because

01:13:30.049 --> 01:13:30.059
basically described its problems because
 

01:13:30.059 --> 01:13:32.180
basically described its problems because
next year that we know the data sent by

01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:32.190
next year that we know the data sent by
 

01:13:32.190 --> 01:13:34.970
next year that we know the data sent by
the agency right and so the management

01:13:34.970 --> 01:13:34.980
the agency right and so the management
 

01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:37.250
the agency right and so the management
of all of that kind of information is

01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:37.260
of all of that kind of information is
 

01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:39.259
of all of that kind of information is
very labor-intensive and not something

01:13:39.259 --> 01:13:39.269
very labor-intensive and not something
 

01:13:39.269 --> 01:13:40.759
very labor-intensive and not something
anybody on my team was ever trained to

01:13:40.759 --> 01:13:40.769
anybody on my team was ever trained to
 

01:13:40.769 --> 01:13:41.990
anybody on my team was ever trained to
do there's none of us were trained in

01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000
do there's none of us were trained in
 

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.990
do there's none of us were trained in
library Sciences right and so that's

01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:45.000
library Sciences right and so that's
 

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.939
library Sciences right and so that's
part of it secondly the maintenance of

01:13:48.939 --> 01:13:48.949
part of it secondly the maintenance of
 

01:13:48.949 --> 01:13:52.009
part of it secondly the maintenance of
the licensing agreements and what you're

01:13:52.009 --> 01:13:52.019
the licensing agreements and what you're
 

01:13:52.019 --> 01:13:53.990
the licensing agreements and what you're
allowed and not allowed to do with the

01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000
allowed and not allowed to do with the
 

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.819
allowed and not allowed to do with the
data who's allowed and not allowed to

01:13:55.819 --> 01:13:55.829
data who's allowed and not allowed to
 

01:13:55.829 --> 01:14:00.560
data who's allowed and not allowed to
see it is something that also we were as

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:00.570
see it is something that also we were as
 

01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:02.000
see it is something that also we were as
a researcher never trained to do I'm

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:02.010
a researcher never trained to do I'm
 

01:14:02.010 --> 01:14:03.649
a researcher never trained to do I'm
sure there are professionals out there

01:14:03.649 --> 01:14:03.659
sure there are professionals out there
 

01:14:03.659 --> 01:14:06.049
sure there are professionals out there
who were trying to do that and so very

01:14:06.049 --> 01:14:06.059
who were trying to do that and so very
 

01:14:06.059 --> 01:14:09.259
who were trying to do that and so very
few okay and so those just two of the

01:14:09.259 --> 01:14:09.269
few okay and so those just two of the
 

01:14:09.269 --> 01:14:10.850
few okay and so those just two of the
big things that consumed a lot of time

01:14:10.850 --> 01:14:10.860
big things that consumed a lot of time
 

01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:13.189
big things that consumed a lot of time
and energy that take us away from doing

01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199
and energy that take us away from doing
 

01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:16.250

health and research that could I think

01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:16.260
health and research that could I think
 

01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:17.870
health and research that could I think
way more efficiently

01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:17.880
way more efficiently
 

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:19.340
way more efficiently
some kind of organized structures

01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:19.350
some kind of organized structures
 

01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:26.600
some kind of organized structures
systematic way essentially well just I

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:26.610
systematic way essentially well just I
 

01:14:26.610 --> 01:14:28.340
systematic way essentially well just I
mean there's really two parts of the

one of the things that John alluded to
 

01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:20.209
one of the things that John alluded to
is just this power of being able to have

that the machines know how to do it you
 

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:40.430
that the machines know how to do it you
can program against it you can do your

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:49.970
the way it's done mostly but but with it
properly taken care of and so you know

01:15:49.970 --> 01:15:49.980

infrastructure i think is a really

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:54.050
infrastructure i think is a really
 

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:57.590
infrastructure i think is a really
important need to enable open access and

01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600
important need to enable open access and
 

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:00.530

investing in John and John in particular
can probably say a lot more about their

01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:04.110
can probably say a lot more about their
 

01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:05.780

well I mean we have a narrative

01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:05.790

01:16:15.649 --> 01:16:15.659
and that's where citations come from and
 

01:16:15.659 --> 01:16:18.439
and that's where citations come from and
so you have author title journal volume

01:16:18.439 --> 01:16:18.449
so you have author title journal volume
 

01:16:18.449 --> 01:16:22.819
so you have author title journal volume
page and you can get to in any library

01:16:22.819 --> 01:16:22.829

that has that journal you can get to the
 

01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:27.020
that has that journal you can get to the

preservation of the records through this
 

01:16:41.250 --> 01:16:44.209
preservation of the records through this
idea of the citation and so those four

01:16:44.209 --> 01:16:44.219
idea of the citation and so those four
 

01:16:44.219 --> 01:16:47.270

into a network data model there are some

01:18:45.339 --> 01:18:45.349
into a network data model there are some
 

01:18:45.349 --> 01:18:47.109
into a network data model there are some
things we can look at from the cultural

01:18:47.109 --> 01:18:47.119
things we can look at from the cultural

web like track back pain which we can

01:18:50.169 --> 01:18:50.179
web like track back pain which we can
 

01:18:50.179 --> 01:18:51.520
web like track back pain which we can
think about it's a track back as an

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:51.530
think about it's a track back as an
 

01:18:51.530 --> 01:18:53.290
think about it's a track back as an
extensible technical protocol it lets

01:18:53.290 --> 01:18:53.300
extensible technical protocol it lets

extensible technical protocol it lets
you say I basically I quoted you in a

01:18:54.969 --> 01:18:54.979
you say I basically I quoted you in a
 

01:18:54.979 --> 01:18:57.580
you say I basically I quoted you in a
blog but you can make it directional and

01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:57.590
blog but you can make it directional and
 

01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:59.500
blog but you can make it directional and
contextual and you can say essentially I

01:18:59.500 --> 01:18:59.510
contextual and you can say essentially I
 

01:18:59.510 --> 01:19:01.540
contextual and you can say essentially I
tracked back to your data set because I

01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:01.550
tracked back to your data set because I
 

01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:03.850
tracked back to your data set because I
used it and I built derived variables on

01:19:03.850 --> 01:19:03.860
used it and I built derived variables on
 

01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:05.709
used it and I built derived variables on
tracked back to it because my algorithm

01:19:05.709 --> 01:19:05.719
tracked back to it because my algorithm
 

01:19:05.719 --> 01:19:07.629
tracked back to it because my algorithm
hit it a track factor because it's crap

01:19:07.629 --> 01:19:07.639
hit it a track factor because it's crap
 

01:19:07.639 --> 01:19:09.609
hit it a track factor because it's crap
which is actually a really important

01:19:09.609 --> 01:19:09.619
which is actually a really important
 

01:19:09.619 --> 01:19:10.540
which is actually a really important
thing to know whether or not you're

01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:10.550
thing to know whether or not you're
 

01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:11.560
thing to know whether or not you're
linking to something because it's good

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:11.570
linking to something because it's good
 

01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:14.529
linking to something because it's good
or because it's bad right and so getting

01:19:14.529 --> 01:19:14.539
or because it's bad right and so getting
 

01:19:14.539 --> 01:19:16.330
or because it's bad right and so getting
through that sorts of experimentation is

01:19:16.330 --> 01:19:16.340
through that sorts of experimentation is
 

01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:17.739
through that sorts of experimentation is
where we have to go before we expect the

01:19:17.739 --> 01:19:17.749
where we have to go before we expect the
 

01:19:17.749 --> 01:19:19.779
where we have to go before we expect the
library to actually maintain a

01:19:19.779 --> 01:19:19.789
library to actually maintain a
 

01:19:19.789 --> 01:19:22.540
library to actually maintain a
meaningful institutional resource but

01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:22.550
meaningful institutional resource but
 

01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:24.100
meaningful institutional resource but
the librarians have to be willing to

01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:24.110
the librarians have to be willing to
 

01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:25.449
the librarians have to be willing to
engage in that not thinking themselves

01:19:25.449 --> 01:19:25.459
engage in that not thinking themselves
 

01:19:25.459 --> 01:19:27.969
engage in that not thinking themselves
just as containers of knowledge but they

01:19:27.969 --> 01:19:27.979
just as containers of knowledge but they
 

01:19:27.979 --> 01:19:29.830
just as containers of knowledge but they
actually play a role is sort of similar

01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840
actually play a role is sort of similar
 

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:32.739
actually play a role is sort of similar
to being a librarian 200 years ago which

01:19:32.739 --> 01:19:32.749
to being a librarian 200 years ago which
 

01:19:32.749 --> 01:19:34.299
to being a librarian 200 years ago which
is where you help them you help the

one of the things I've noticed not not

01:19:40.569 --> 01:19:40.579
one of the things I've noticed not not
 

01:19:40.579 --> 01:19:41.859
one of the things I've noticed not not
to disparage anyone but one of the

01:19:41.859 --> 01:19:41.869
to disparage anyone but one of the
 

01:19:41.869 --> 01:19:44.020
to disparage anyone but one of the
things I've noticed in the culture of

01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:44.030
things I've noticed in the culture of

the GIS world is very free sharing of

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:48.530
the GIS world is very free sharing of
 

01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:52.299
the GIS world is very free sharing of
data sets and so it almost seems to me

01:19:52.299 --> 01:19:52.309
data sets and so it almost seems to me
 

01:19:52.309 --> 01:19:53.859
data sets and so it almost seems to me
you get a couple of geographers in a

01:19:53.859 --> 01:19:53.869
you get a couple of geographers in a
 

01:19:53.869 --> 01:19:56.560
you get a couple of geographers in a
room and they start trading memory

01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:56.570
room and they start trading memory
 

01:19:56.570 --> 01:20:00.189
room and they start trading memory
sticks and so I have really interesting

01:20:00.189 --> 01:20:00.199
sticks and so I have really interesting
 

01:20:00.199 --> 01:20:02.669
sticks and so I have really interesting
and amazing data that has come to us

01:20:02.669 --> 01:20:02.679
and amazing data that has come to us
 

01:20:02.679 --> 01:20:04.929
and amazing data that has come to us
that are never ever going to use for a

01:20:04.929 --> 01:20:04.939
that are never ever going to use for a
 

01:20:04.939 --> 01:20:07.899
that are never ever going to use for a
look at because I have no idea how we

01:20:07.899 --> 01:20:07.909
look at because I have no idea how we
 

01:20:07.909 --> 01:20:10.359
look at because I have no idea how we
got it where it came from where that

01:20:10.359 --> 01:20:10.369
got it where it came from where that
 

01:20:10.369 --> 01:20:13.149
got it where it came from where that
person got it wrong but there is seems

01:20:13.149 --> 01:20:13.159
person got it wrong but there is seems
 

01:20:13.159 --> 01:20:16.719
person got it wrong but there is seems
to be this culture in the geography

01:20:16.719 --> 01:20:16.729
to be this culture in the geography
 

01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:18.879
to be this culture in the geography
maybe but what as an epidemiologist I've

01:20:18.879 --> 01:20:18.889
maybe but what as an epidemiologist I've
 

01:20:18.889 --> 01:20:20.640
maybe but what as an epidemiologist I've
noticed it where there's a lot of

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:20.650
noticed it where there's a lot of
 

01:20:20.650 --> 01:20:23.140
noticed it where there's a lot of
trading back and forth of data

01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:23.150
trading back and forth of data
 

01:20:23.150 --> 01:20:26.320
trading back and forth of data
test and that's not usable in an

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:26.330
test and that's not usable in an
 

01:20:26.330 --> 01:20:28.450
test and that's not usable in an
academic world because I could never

academic world because I could never

under the quality of it and so that also

01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:33.230
under the quality of it and so that also
 

01:20:33.230 --> 01:20:36.090
under the quality of it and so that also
might be a role for libraries as the

might be a role for libraries as the
 

01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:38.740
might be a role for libraries as the

01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:38.750
