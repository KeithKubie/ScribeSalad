00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.940
Professional sports teams have always tried
to find unique ways to get fans into the seats.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.780
Whether it was the legendary Bill Veeck batting
the shortest player in baseball history (Eddie

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.660
Gaedel at 3 foot 7 inches) or Disco Demolition
Night at Comiskey Park in Chicago, sometimes

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.680
the game plays second fiddle to the crazy
promotions.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.599
Hardly anyone was better at this than Joe
Engel, known as the “Barnum of Baseball”.

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.261
Engel began his career in baseball as a mediocre
pitcher for the Washington Senators, but his

00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:38.030
skills as a scout began his ascent into upper
management.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.850
Engel is credited for discovering such Hall
of Fame talent as Joe Cronin, Goose Goslin,

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.070
and Bucky Harris.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.690
His scouting expertise caught the eye of Washington
Senators owner Clark Griffith, who had recently

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.420
acquired the Chattanooga Lookouts as a farm
team for the Senators.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.030
In 1929, Griffith decided to promote Engel
to director of baseball operations for his

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.180
new minor league team.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.760
Engel, delighted, immediately seized the opportunity.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.460
Joe Engel would be in charge of the Chattanooga
Lookouts for 34 years, bringing not just baseball

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.420
to the citizens of Chattanooga, but wackiness
as well.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.980
He would do just about anything to get people
into the ballpark.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:19.180
He built a state-of-the-art stadium (for the
time) with his own money (at the cost of $150,000,

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.200
about $2 million today) and named it Engel
Stadium, after himself.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.890
He had all his players ride to the game on
elephants; he had a duck lay an egg on second

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.819
base; and he even wept in a “crying cage”
after his team lost out on a bid to host the

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:33.930
All-Star game.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.300
In 1931, he signed a female pitcher named
Virne “Jackie” Mitchell and had her pitch

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.960
against the New York Yankees in a exhibition
game.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:02:36.190
She promptly struck out Babe Ruth and Lou
Gehrig back to back, two of

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:45.610
the greatest hitters ever.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.040
In 1937, Engel’s boss, Clark Griffith, wanted
to sell the team.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.040
Engel, seeing this as an opportunity, persuaded
1,700 Lookout fans to buy shares of the club

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.400
at five bucks a pop.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.170
Engel wanted to make the Lookouts a team with
“local ownership” (otherwise known as

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.020
a publicly-owned team, something the NFL’s
Green Bay Packers currently have).

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.490
Unfortunately, within a year, there still
wasn’t enough cash, and Griffith bought

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.510
back the team.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.160
One of the most well-known Joe Engel stories,
though, was the day in 1931 he decided to

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.710
trade his shortstop for a turkey.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.010
Johnny Jones was a Chattanooga Lookouts player
that, frankly, wasn’t any good.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.560
He was such a weak-hitting shortstop that
even the press complained about him.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.270
So, in January 1931, Engel decided to trade
him to the Charlotte Hornets of the Piedmont

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.064
League (they were not affiliated with any
major league team at the time, but in 1937,

00:03:24.064 --> 00:03:25.064
the Hornets would be bought by the Washington
Senators).

00:03:25.064 --> 00:03:26.540
In return, Engel and the Lookouts received
a 25 pound turkey.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.880
Said Engel, “The turkey was having a better
year.”

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.740
In addition, he wanted the turkey to arrive
at team headquarters by February 22nd, in

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.850
time for the Southern Writers’ Association
Dinner.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.760
At the dinner, Engel served the turkey to
the writers, reportedly declaring “You’ve

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.100
been giving me the bird, so now have one on
me.”

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.120
Everyone enjoyed the meal, though Engel commented
that he thought Charlotte won the trade because

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.210
the turkey was a little tough.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.590
As for Johnny Jones, no one is quite sure
what happened to him.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:04:03.020
Since records are spotty for minor league
teams in the early 20th century, it’s hard

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:26.020
to know for sure, but most think he retired
without ever playing for

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:34.060
the Charlotte Hornets.
