Speaker 1:          00:01          I think, I think there's a lot of moments in your life that you find yourself doing something. Okay? There's anybody in here. My name is Brittany.

Speaker 2:          00:11          I'd love to be able to talk with you

Speaker 1:          00:14          and you take that moment and step back from it.

Speaker 2:          00:16          Are you here

Speaker 1:          00:19          and you realize come through to us. What the fuck am I doing? What just happened? Was this real? I think that was one of those moments. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and today on the podcast.

Speaker 3:          00:33          Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:36          a ghost story. Really. We're going to do a ghost story at Halloween, Dude. Well, you don't even know what, we're just listen. All right, let's listen. Okay. Okay. This one comes from our producer Matt Kielty yet. So I first heard the story from a buddy of mine. Do, do, do, do, do who do? His name is Dennis Conroe. Dennis. Andy. Hey, what's up dude? That's producer, Ania Mills. You guys are all buddies. [inaudible] total buds. Anyways, the story. All right, well, Dennis, yes, it's about a lot of things, but in particular our house. So let's, let's start with the house. When did you move back in? Uh, well, let's see. I was probably, I don't know, age 20. Dennis had been going to college. Yep. By the way, what did you, what did you study? Uh, creative writing. Okay. But, uh, yeah, like just cut and just kinda got bored there. Kinda stopped going to class.

Speaker 1:          01:26          I think once white parents realize that, uh, they weren't very happy and I would assume so. And so, uh, so yeah, I was kind of uh, asked to come back home, back to a town just outside Kansas City, a little town called Grandview. Did you grow up in this house? I did. I did. And the house was fairly old. Yeah, it was about 105 years old at the time. Two Story White House. Nice little porch awning over it. Typical Farmhouse Style and see you, you were at your parents' home in your, in your old bedroom. Yup. And my old childhood bedroom. Yeah. So there was always a sense of like, I need to get out of this house that's holding me back somehow from things. So we got a job, worked a job and got laid off and one year turned into two and then three, then four, and then five.

Speaker 1:          02:16          It was not, not a great time to be there. In what way? Just that I felt like I was still 16 he says he'd overhear his mom telling people on the phone. Oh, well yeah, he's never gonna move out. Is He? And then she started circling classifieds, jobs for typists, creating press sales rep type setter. I Dunno. I think everything in my whole, my life, however I mean for it not to sort of moves at my own snail's pace eventually. Well it was fairly old, like 27 maybe. Actually he was, he was 28 after eight years in this house, Dennis gets a steady job, finds this cheap apartment, this ratty six plex apartment, packing up his things. But right when he said to move out to finally leave home, my mom got really sick. Dennis, his mom had been remission from breast cancer for like nine years, but that summer her doctors told her that it had returned and had spread quite a bit.

Speaker 1:          03:18          So I said to her like, uh, you know, do you, do you want me to be here or do you want me to go? And she was like, well, you know, if this is my time, uh, she wants to go knowing that her kids can take care of themselves. So Dennis moved out about five months later. His mom died. Yeah, she went pretty fast. About about a month or so after my mom died, my dad found out he had stage four prostate cancer and he was really too sick to take care of the house and just being the guy by himself at that point. Now Dennis pretty much had to come home. I'd take care of him three, four times a week. And as he got worse, he had said to me like, Hey, let's try to find you a house to buy so that I can teach you how to like do all of the kind of stuff that one has to do. You know, that men know how to do things like change out plumbing, all this kind of stuff. And so we put an offer on a house, but that fell through and before they could find something else, the cancer from his prostate spread to his brain. And uh, you know, the last week of his life, he was really not there.

Speaker 2:          04:31          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          04:31          I can remember one day. Yeah. Like maybe, maybe a week or so after he had died, Dennis was walking through the empty kitchen and uh, there was so much stuff, there was so much stuff, papers all over the place, junk mail all over the kitchen floor, down in the basement, tools all over the place. You know, I had this moment of yeah, here are his tools and I add, now I have them in my hands and you know, I just remember picking up this claw hammer and just crying because this is now my hammer. This is now my house. This is now my problem. But few days pass and you start thinking, okay, I can handle this. Yeah, just gotta get in there, clean it out, sell it clean and flip. That was the plan. So at the age of 32 moose back in, there was all this junk in the basement, put that stuff on the curb sale after sale after sale.

Speaker 1:          05:28          And one day he finds himself standing in the downstairs bathroom looking at the nasty for tile. It was just horrible. His dad had meant to replace it before he died, but you know, couldn't finish. And my thought was like, oh, we'll just do this one bathroom. So it looks pretty good to sell. Problem was steady, never showed them how to do any of that stuff. That's that point that I was like, oh, youtube, all the tile in one hand firmly. And then your sermon towel. Never went online. Learn how to tile, do some plumbing, any redid the and turned out pretty good. It was kind of fun. Uh, and then the next thing I knew I was taking wallpaper off of the kitchen flats. Gotta go hardwood floors, insulation in the attic, glass block, windows in the basement. And pretty soon that turned into the whole house.

Speaker 1:          06:12          And how long does that take? Uh, five years. Actually it was six. Wow. And he says the whole time he was doing this renovation at night, uh, I would have these dreams where, mm. My parents just kind of came through the back door and it was just like, oh, what are you doing here? Oh, that's right. You're your dad. And then I would turn my back and then they would have somehow undone all of the things that I did. Oh, they had brought the house back to where? What state it was in when they were alive. Yeah. Huh. And I probably had this dream, I'm not kidding, like at least a hundred times. Wow. Night after night after night. We just kept going on and on and ultimately kind of drove me crazy. And so one day after yet another one of these streams, Dennis is finally like, all right, I'm selling it, puts it up in the market, starts waiting for a buyer.

Speaker 1:          07:13          And then something strange happens. Well, something kind of strange. I had made this friend and she came over for the first time, like a date lady friend. Yeah. It was a lady friend. You'd got on a date, you'd taken her back to your house. And so just giving her a tour, showing her all the improvements until she was in the kitchen right by the basement door in the kitchen when she was like, oh, there's some kind of weird presence here. And I was just like, ah, okay. Well that was kind of a sign that it was not going to last.

Speaker 1:          07:47          Fast forward a few years, it didn't really think too much about it until one day dentist is really there is having an open house, no one shows. So she was in the house by herself and Dennis starts getting these text messages from her like, dude, your house is haunted. Like I can hear people walking around. And she texted that there was definitely something weird going on right by the basement door. Oh wait, that's the same spot. I was like, ah, that's, that's kind of weird. But then here's the crazy thing, uh, not too long after this, Dennis bumped into an old friend of his and he's like, Hey, funny thing, two different people, two separate occasions had come over to the house and they said they felt this weird presence and she was like, wait, right by the basement door, get out. Yeah. I was like, okay.

Speaker 1:          08:33          So I've got Heather, I've got Stacy, I've got Carla, all three who say they feel this weird presence. Would you consider yourself a bit of a skeptic about such things? I would say so. Rationally. I'm just, I'm just going to say no. So you don't believe in ghosts? No. All right. What happened next? Well, this also happened to be right at the time that I sold the house, Dennis had finally put some pen to paper, signed a contract, packed up all stuff. And so Carla, the girl that first felt this thing, the girl he went on a day with me, they stayed friends, uh, said to me like, you know, I'm really curious about this. Uh, would you mind if I call like these ghost people to come and like check out this place? I was like, well sure. I don't care. Yeah. It's like why not?

Speaker 1:          09:21          I mean, so very shortly in a few minutes actually we are bringing paranormal investigators to find out what's in the basement. You know, I'm just kinda walking through the house. I think I got this on tape of just me walking through the house. Like, well yeah, this is probably a waste of time, but I'm still kind of curious about it Friday night. What else you got to do? Right. It's a Friday night, mid November, around six o'clock I can see some cars parking on the street. So I go downstairs, people start filing in maybe 10 people all have different specialties. Larry's our tech guy bought for techies, two sets of clairvoyants. Sean tells the psychic she's very gifted. Who are all these people to just say your name. My name is Brittany. Well, they're part of the Kansas City paranormal investigators club or some kind of thing. And pretty much right off the bat when you guys came in and you were saying like you could talk to, but when we first got here, we both saw a woman looking out the window.

Speaker 1:          10:27          She looked like I didn't really see what she looked like. She had hair, it was like gray and she was wearing one of those weird old tiny dresses. Dennis was like whatever. They set up cameras in the basement and in the kitchen and the clairvoyants decided they wanted to try to talk to this woman or maybe any other spirit in the house. And so Brittany even explain to you what we do, who was like the ringleader of the night. She sort of explained how she does things, you know, she was like, the best way that she could get them to talk to to to them was through a flashlights, Huh? Yes. So what they do is they take a few flashlights, turn them on, and then they unscrew the tops of them just enough so that they turn off and then they just kind of set the flashlights that are now off in the room by themselves. And the idea is that if the ghost or the spirit wants to communicate, they can just sort of touch the top of one in the flashlights with their gusty finger and that'll turn it back on.

Speaker 1:          11:34          I'm just like, okay. So she took three flashlights and we all sat in this dark room in a circle and a Brittany sets the flashlights in the middle of the circle by themselves. No one's touching them. And she says, my name is Brittany. I love to be able to talk with you. Can you turn one of those lights on? And we sit there and you sit there, are you here? Then all of a sudden this light whoa kind of barely blinks on. And then she said, okay, thank you. Please turn it off. And then it goes off. What we can do with these lights here is if I can ask, and then she says, we have three lights here. The one you just turned on, we'll call. Yes, please turn on one more. And that will be, no, you could do that for us. That will be wonderful. And then a second light comes on. No Way. He likes scanning the room, like looking for somebody who has like a little switch or something. Yeah. But like we didn't pay these people so they have no reason to fake this I suppose. But you know, I just keep thinking, well, you know, the counselors really close to the train tracks and maybe maybe the train vibrations of the train. Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker 4:          13:00          But

Speaker 1:          13:00          all of a sudden they were like, can you hear that

Speaker 2:          13:07          footsteps? Sounds like that's okay mom. Okay.

Speaker 1:          13:14          And they're going towards the kitchen and I could hear dishes rattling on the countertop in the kitchen. No one's in the kitchen. No one's in the kitchen. If you're in the kitchen right now, can you turn one of these lights on? And so they sit and stare at these three flashlights

Speaker 2:          13:41          and then I didn't miss, remember leaving the room. What happened?

Speaker 4:          13:53          Um, well, uh, actually everyone, everyone in that room, um, died except for Dennis.

Speaker 2:          14:06          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          14:06          I have no idea why I even invited you into this building.

Speaker 2:          14:10          They did not die. What happened to them?

Speaker 1:          14:15          Actually, they're fine. It turns out that, uh, there was a guy downstairs in the basement, one of the techies walking around pitch black down there and he just like bangs his head into like an air duct and the sound just reverberated throughout the whole house. Scared him a little bit. It was very Blair witchy. Yeah. Anyhow, the techies decide that they want to get the three psychics down in the basement by themselves. And so, you know, these three lumen go down in the basement by themselves. We kind of hear them downstairs talking, but we don't really know what's going on.

Speaker 2:          14:54          Was interesting. Yeah. They come back upstairs and they said, uh, the girl was downstairs with the, she was definitely down there.

Speaker 1:          15:04          The old woman that they first saw when they got to the house and they said that she was standing down in the basement next to where the old furnace used to be. And they told Dennis that she said that she'd lived here for a long time and Dennis was like, wait a second. He knew that back in the thirties or something, a woman had lived in this house who was kind of not all there, and one day she had gone down into the basement and thought she was picking Weiss off of chickens and throwing them into this big furnace that was downstairs in the basement at the time. She got a little too close to the furnace story, goes, caught herself on fire and then died there I guess in the basement. Oh.

Speaker 2:          15:43          But then there was another man downstairs. He showed himself to me, but he won't talk and just completely disappeared. What did he look like? He was bald. He was about Rick site, but it wasn't right. Um, yeah, a lot like that. Not a lot, but similar. Definitely. If I were to show you a picture of my father, would you have any sense of this was him? If I saw a picture of him? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          16:19          Dennis goes and gets his photo of his dad that he had that was leftover from his memorial service.

Speaker 2:          16:26          Yep. That's man I saw. Really? Wow. That's just, just a second. Like here, she's very hesitant at the beginning. Just like, well, you know,

Speaker 1:          16:37          jump in here really quick and just tell you that this was actually the first time that Dennis had ever listened to this tape. Really? Yeah. And the reason is because for a long time he didn't want to listen to it. Why? Well, I think part of it had to do with this moment because this was the point where my skepticism kind of kicked off and part of it had to do with what happens next that's coming up when we return.

Speaker 4:          19:11          This is radio lab. Let's get back to Matt Kielty's ghost story and we're pick up with our main guy, Dennis Conroe, having just heard from the ghost hunters that they encountered a spirit in the basement of his home who looks remarkably like his dead father.

Speaker 1:          19:27          Yeah, that's man. I saw you. Yep. So He's here. He's here. Can we, can we try to talk to him? We can try to talk to him at the basements or here or all over. He went upstairs. Not In the basement anymore. Can we go upstairs and just talk to him? Yeah. So no, I hadn't really told them a whole lot about what the different rooms in the house were, but they led me upstairs to what was his room and to the corner of the room where his bed was. And they had no idea that that used to be, they had no idea. And I said to them, okay, well if he's going to talk, he'll just talk to me.

Speaker 2:          20:15          [inaudible] are you here? Did you turn on a lights? If you are. Thank you. Thank you ma'am. Uh, we're gonna call that yes. If you can turn that one off now and turn on the no light. Any other light?

Speaker 1:          20:39          I need to know that you're here.

Speaker 2:          20:46          Thanks God. Do you want us to leave? Um, Dad, what? Do you like these people to leave and just talk to me? Yes. Okay. Uh, Damn. I'd want to know, are you in a good spot? Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay with that? Yes. All right, good. I'm glad to hear that. Okay. Everything off. Think so off. Almost. Almost. All right, thanks. Yep. And it asks you is, you know, is mark here too? This mom here too and okay. The other of the three flashlights lights up, huh? Yes, she is. Oh, she goes here and I miss you. I have so many questions for you. I can't ask them all and just yes or no questions. But I said, well, have you been able to see the things that I've done to the house? And both of the lights lit up very brightly. Yes. And then, so I've lived here for six years. Three of things, you know, I said, what do you think? Are you happy with this? Are you happy with the things I've done with the house? And they both lit up very brightly. Yes.

Speaker 8:          23:07          And, uh, I said, are you proud of me?

Speaker 2:          23:13          Are you proud of what I've done? It's very funny. Yes. So in a few days, uh, I would probably never stepped foot in this house and I don't want you to like stay here and feel like you belong here to free. Can you look blue? Cool. This house willing to fight. [inaudible] yeah. I'm going to brief you guys that you hadn't haunting my dreams on this house. I know it's very important to you. Important to me. This is the time we leave. Okay. Yeah. [inaudible] so that's where it ends. Yeah. Uh, that's how I recall it being exactly like that. And yeah, I kind of teared up and pen.

Speaker 4:          25:52          Um, and keep in mind that this was the first time that Dennis had heard this tape and so we played it back to him cause we just wanted to see like how he remembered that experience. Yeah. I guess part of, part of,

Speaker 2:          26:05          part of my fear of listening to it was that it would change it and that it would be a different experience. It would be a little more hokey and it would be a little more unclear what was happening. But, uh, listen to it again. I, you know, it was as I recalled it being [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          26:25          so in the end, does he believe he was actually talking to his dead parents? Well, um, no, no. Uh, I, I ended up actually calling this guy who explained to me how this whole flashlight thing works and that there is a perfectly non paranormal explanation as to what's going on with the flashlight. It almost feels bad manners at this point to have a practice later. But I'm very curious to hear it. Sure. Well, what's going on is, um, you turn the flashlight on. Yeah. And when you turn the flashlight on, the bulb gets really hot, right? And then you take the top of the flashlight and you unscrew it just like enough that the flashlight flickers off. So the flashlights off and um, the bulb, it got really hot. So the inside of the flashlight also got really hot and there's this little piece of plastic inside the flashlight.

Speaker 4:          27:13          And when it got hot, it expanded. And now as the flat sends the flashlights off, that piece of plastic, it starts to cool down and starts to contract. And when it contracts, it pushes these two tiny bits of metal together. These two little bits of metal come into contact and that's your circuit. So the circuit opens the light bulb, it goes back on, then it warms again, and then it gets hot. Yeah. And so the little piece of plastic, it starts to expand. It pushes the two pieces apart. People chose this flashlight because it had that particular property. Yeah. Do you think it's like a con or something? No, I don't think so. No, I don't think so. I mean, I even talked to Dennis about this. He's like, I think they're just trying to make sense of, of randomness. I mean they don't, I don't think they necessarily know that this flashlight does this thing and therefore they can manipulate people. Here's why I don't think it's a con because in this case it's such a, it's such a strange coincidence that whenever he wants his mom and dad, his ghostly mother and father to approve of him and congratulate him and honor him with a yes. I mean it's random. He could get to know, but he gets a yes. It's just chance. And you told Dennis all this?

Speaker 4:          28:24          Yeah, I told Dennis, cause you told me to tell Dennis [inaudible] I forced him. Okay. So when you told him, what did he say? Um, well, on one level, like it, it didn't phase him. Dennis basically said like, look, I know, I know that the way that the world works is the way the world works. People don't come back from the dead. People don't talk to you through flashlights. But he also said that like, he's not gonna let go of that experience. He wants to have it both ways. I guess. So I guess I guess I want to have both. Yes. This didn't happen and yes, this absolutely happened. I understand that. Yeah. Because even if you are the world's biggest skeptic, if you don't believe in ghosts, like there really aren't that many ways to talk about these sorts of things, these sorts of things that we all feel, you know, guilt for, for the things that we've done in our past. The loss of those who, who we've loved, that like ghost stories kind of seem to stick around because they are an experience. I'll be at like a metaphorical experience, but an experience that lets us talk about these things that we can't adequately talk about. Um, you know, that feeling of, of being haunted.

Speaker 9:          29:40          [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         29:41          anticipate. Did he eventually sell the house? Move out? Yeah. Yeah. Sold the house, moved out. No more dreams of his parents haunting in.

Speaker 2:          29:49          Oh, well it's been odd in the time that I've sold the house now I thought the dreams would stop and now the dreams are that I am the one haunting the house of the new people where I will just walk in. Really? Yeah. And just be like, Hey, I'm here. That, yeah. And Are you like going around repairing things? Nope. I'm just like being somewhat shocked at what they've done to it. It's like, it never stops, you know?

Speaker 10:         30:23          Thanks Matt. No problem. Matt. Guilty.

Speaker 4:          30:31          And, uh, if you want to know a little bit more, a little more detailed about the flashlight trick, it's not really a trick flashlight phenomenon. Uh, you can check it out on our website, radiolab.org, uh, Mexico posts there that explains it in greater detail. And also you can see some pictures of Dennis's house and, uh, yeah, that's all we can say at this holiday moment. Indeed. Set their names. I guess I'm Jad Abumrad Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich. Thanks for listening.
