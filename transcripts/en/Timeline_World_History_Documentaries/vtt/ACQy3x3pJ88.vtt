00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.300
[Narrator] This is the story of an England that never was.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.900
Radical, militarized and truly protestant,

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.000
and of the king who tried to take us there.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.600
His quest to change England,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.000
was to tear apart his family and his country,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.200
dissect brother against sister and church against people.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.060
His name was Edward,

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.000
and he inherited the throne when he was only nine.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:57.000
(Bells Ringing)

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.500
For 25 years,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.000
King Henry VIII had been trying to father a male heir.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.700
Finally, after three wives and two daughters, he had succeeded.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.000
And Queen Jane Seymour gave birth to a son.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.820
The country rejoiced.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.600
On the 12th of October 1537, Edward was born here at Hampton Court.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.680
Three days later, the baby was christened.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.000
The galleries, chambers and halls of the palace were hung with tapestry.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The baby was carried in possessions through them.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.880
All the splendor and magnificence of the Tudor court were there:

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.000
there were drums and trumpets,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
heralds and lords and ladies

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.600
walking after the baby sharing in the triumph with the midwife who delivered him.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.920
And the wet nurse who were suckling him.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.180
The christening itself took place on high platform in the central of the chapel

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.310
The font was of silver, lined with soft linen and filled with warm water

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.880
and there under a canopy of cloth of gold, the baby was christened Edward

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.820
and the harolds proclaimed this title "Duke of Cornwall", "Earl of Chester", son and heir

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.220
of the right High Mighty and victorious Prince, King Henry the VIII (eighth)

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.360
*Classical Music Plays*

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.220
But then tragedy struck, the birth had

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.580
been a long and difficult one. At first, Queen Jane seemed to recover,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.940
then she caught poor pure fever. Within a week of the christening, she was dead.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.960
It would be easy to exaggerate the emotional impact on Edward of his mother's death

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.120
at such an early age. Even when their mothers alive,

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.980
royal babies, especially boys, wouldn't normally spent much time with them.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.400
Moreover, there were many substitutes on which Edward's affection could fix.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.540
Edward's infant years were spent amongst the women, like any other Tudor boy.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.880
Accounts of the time describe Edward as both "mary and pretty".

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.940
A promising future king loved and spoiled by his father on his infrequent visits

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.660
But looked after by his devoted nurses.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.480
He was moved between the various royal residences, but spent much

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.620
time in a house in "Hertfordshire", where for a while both his half

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.280
sisters "Mary" and "Elizabeth", lived with him in a strange game of happy families.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.900
 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.460
This picture was painted in 1544

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.840
when Edward was 6 (six) years old.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:28.140
It's normally called "The family of Henry VIII" (Eighth). But it's not about family in the modern sense,

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.160
in which relationships are about love and affection. Instead

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.140
it's dynasty, in which relationships are about power.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.540
That's why in the middle, so much bigger than everybody else is there, the king, Henry VIII (eighth).

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.680
Next to him is the queen, but it's not the actual queen, of 1554,

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.040
Instead it's Jane Seymour, she's long dead.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.660
But she show next to Henry because she's the mother of Edward, the heir.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.400
And he is on his father's right hand snuggling up to him

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.380
Not out of affection...but to symbolize that he's the successor. On either side

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.860
are Edward's two half sisters.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.740
Mary is the daughter of Henry's first wife "Catherine of Aragon".

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.780
Elizabeth is the daughter of Henry's second wife "Anne Boleyn".

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.420
Mary and Elizabeth were declared "bastards" when their mothers were divorced.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.640
But they appear in this picture because Henry had decided once more

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.540
to include them in the succession. And to do it moreover by act of

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.590
parliament. This laid down that the heir was first Edward. If he

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.460
died without heirs, second, Mary, and if she died without heirs,

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.620
third Elizabeth.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.160
The seeds of more than a decade of trouble was sown.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.350
Remarkably, Edward has left us his own account

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.220
of the turbulent years of his childhood. Written as if he were a character

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.000
in his own drama. [Edward VI] "The year

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.780
of  our lord, 1537

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.280
to Prince Brawn, to King Harry the eighth

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.040
By Jane Seymour van queen"

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.490
[Narrator] When he was six, Edward was brought back here to "Hampton Court"

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.340
to begin his education. The ambition and scope of which

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.360
he faithfully recorded. [Edward VI]  "The learning of tongues of the scripture,

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.060
of philosophy, and all liberal sciences."

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.220
[Narrator] He's already learned of course to read and write in English.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.960
But not the serious business of teaching him Latin got underway.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.920
His tutor was Dr. Richard Cox. Cox was an able man,

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:58.920
but he was also arrogant and dogmatic. and it's clear that the early encounters

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.920
between Cox and Edward were busing affairs. Literally so,

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.080
because Cox did not spare the birch on his princely pupil,

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.640
thus overcoming "his captain will" as he described.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.660
But perhaps most importantly, Richard Cox was a protestant.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.640
As were all of Edward's later tutors. And this was the faith which Edward himself

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.880
was passionately to adopt.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:33.820
All across Europe, Protestantism was spreading from its original heartland in Germany.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:39.140
It was more than just a different form of church service, it represented

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.240
a different way of seeing and experiencing the world.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.800
 

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.390
 

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.370
 

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:04.150
 

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:09.120
 

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:13.260
 

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.300
 

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:22.680
 

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.250
 

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:31.760
 

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:37.080
 

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:42.240
 

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:46.290
 

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:51.330
 

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.760
 

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.020
 

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:20.940
 

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.340

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:49.460
 

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:53.930
 

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:59.050
 

00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:04.010
 

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:09.070
 

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:14.350
 

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:19.580
 

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:24.840
 

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.710
 

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:32.680
 

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:37.000
 

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:42.280
 

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:47.360
 

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:52.090
 

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:56.930
 

00:44:56.990 --> 00:45:01.010
 

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:06.090
 

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:09.980
 

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:14.870
 

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:19.210
 

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:24.360
 

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:29.630
 

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:33.580

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:56.540
 

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:06.410
 

00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:10.250
 

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:16.420

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.680
 

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:45.390
 

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:56.400
Despite the dying Edward's heroic efforts of will, his

00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:01.490
scheme for the succession failed. For Edward, preserving Protestantism

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:06.480
was all that mattered, but the English decided differently. They wanted

00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:11.220
a real Tudor as the next monarch, and for that, they were prepared

00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:16.830
for anything, even for Edward's worst nightmare. A return to

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:19.080
Catholic England.
