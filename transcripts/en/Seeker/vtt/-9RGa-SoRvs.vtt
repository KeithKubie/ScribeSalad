00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.819
Like humans, spacecraft also go to a cemetery
when they die, only this one isn’t in a

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:05.819
memorial park.

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.190
It’s here, this super remote spot in the
Pacific Ocean that’s actually known as the

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.460
spacecraft cemetery.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.120
It’s the farthest point on the globe from
any human civilization, which means it’s

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.210
the safest place to have hot metal falling
from the sky.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.019
Humans have purposefully crashed hundred of
spaceships at this spot.

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.380
Which is super cool, and kind of sad.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.690
The old adage of “what goes up must come
down” applies to things in space, too.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:30.690
Granted, not all of them.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.010
A spacecraft launched with enough velocity
on the right trajectory won’t come back

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.430
to Earth, but things in Earth orbit will.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.620
Like China’s prototype space station, Tiangong-1,
that’s expected to fall back to Earth late

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.059
in March or early April of 2018.

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.309
The unusual thing here is, it’s going to
do it out of control!

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.809
Which raises the question of what happens
when spacecraft die and have to home.

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.900
We have to do something with this old equipment,
because most of the time they’re going to

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.920
come down no matter what we do.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.910
Satellites and space stations orbit because
their speed — about 17,500 miles per hour

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.950
— balances against the pull of gravity.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.230
The higher the orbit, the more stable it is,
too.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.920
That’s because low-Earth orbit isn’t a
perfect vacuum.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.660
There’s no hard line where our atmosphere
ends.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.900
Instead, it gradually peters out meaning there’s
a thin veil of molecules that extends to where

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.430
some satellites do orbit.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.820
Those molecules create drag, slowing the satellites
until they can’t keep up the fight against

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.430
the pull of gravity and they reenter the atmosphere.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.030
This also happens in the region where the
International Space Station orbits — about

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.540
200 miles above the planet.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.690
So, to keep satellites in orbit we need to
boost them continually.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.710
Small bursts of speed kick satellites and
stations up just enough to offset the drag

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.000
of the upper atmosphere.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.811
Since most satellites and space stations are
designed with a limited lifetime, mission

00:01:46.811 --> 00:01:51.430
planners have figure out how to bring them
home before they’re even launched.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.350
When they’re ready to die, retrorockets
fire against the direction of travel slow

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.800
the payload deliberately and start a reentry
into the atmosphere, where most small satellites

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.800
just burn up.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.900
But, there is another scenario.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.570
If a satellite or space station is dead or
nearly out of fuel, things can get a little

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.960
more complicated.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.140
Without power, engineers can’t control the
deorbit burn to bring it down in predictable

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.140
place.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.500
They have to cross their fingers and hope
that it won’t fall over a city.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.340
This is exactly where we are with Tiangong-1.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.630
Engineers dealing with the station CAN map
its orbit and predict when it might come down,

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.150
but they can’t predict every atmospheric
disturbance that will affect where exactly

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.150
it lands.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.360
The station itself is about 34 feet long and
weighs close to 19,000 pounds (8.5mt).

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.810
A fair bit of it is expected to burn up on
reentry, but large pieces could reach Earth.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.500
That mass falling fast could do some damage,
fatal damage if it hits a person!

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.170
But it’s a slim chance.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.600
Luckily, most of the planet is ocean, and
there are more unpopulated areas than cities

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.390
in the world, so you shouldn’t really have
to worry.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.060
Leftover spacecraft are a big deal, burning
up or crashing is nice, because otherwise

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.470
they just hang out and get in the way of new
missions or maybe future vacations!

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.160
Learn more here.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.640
Satellites orbiting too high to bring home
are put into a graveyard orbit some 22,400

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.540
miles up, where they’ll be out of the way.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.069
Thanks for watching!
