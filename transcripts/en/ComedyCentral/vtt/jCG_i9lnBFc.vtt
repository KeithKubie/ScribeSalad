&gt;&gt; Jon: I'M NOT A CHEF...

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:20.092 size:88% position:44% line:91%
BUT I THOUGHT THE THING THAT
GAVE THOSE DONUTS THE BRIGHT

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:25.564 line:85%
WHITE LOOK WAS POWDERED SUGAR!

00:04:25.597 --> 00:04:28.668 size:84% position:42% line:91%

00:04:41.914 --> 00:04:49.322 line:91%
HERE'S HOW YOU KNOW KRAFT HAS
NOT CHANGED THEIR INGREDIENTS.

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:50.923 size:88% position:44% line:91%
KRAFT IS STILL NOT LEGALLY
ALLOWED TO CALL THIS PRODUCT

00:04:50.956 --> 00:04:52.157 align:start position:0% line:85%
"CHEESE."

00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:56.228 line:91%

00:04:57.296 --> 00:04:59.432 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE ACADEMY HAS A PROGRAM
CALLED KIDS EAT RIGHT.

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:02.068 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT
WITH KRAFT WHERE KRAFT

00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:05.571 align:start position:0% line:91%
IS HELPING SUPPORT THIS. THEY'RE
GIVING MONEY TO THE ACADEMY

00:05:05.604 --> 00:05:07.807 align:start position:0% line:91%
TO SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM AND IN
EXCHANGE THEY

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.841 align:start position:0% line:91%
GET TO PUT THIS LABEL ON THEIR
PRODUCTS.

00:05:08.874 --> 00:05:10.943 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SO KRAFT IS PAYING THE
ACADEMY --

00:05:10.976 --> 00:05:14.146 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT SOUNDS REASONABLE.
TURNS OUT THE ACADEMY OF

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:19.251 align:start position:0% line:91%
