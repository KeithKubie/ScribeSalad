00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
means we lose our taxes on this and we
 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.470 align:start position:0%
means we lose our taxes on this and we

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
don't you know they they could then
 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
don't you know they they could then
destroy<00:00:46.870><c> our</c><00:00:47.079><c> industry</c><00:00:47.620><c> on</c><00:00:47.739><c> that</c><00:00:47.980><c> and</c><00:00:48.250><c> it's</c><00:00:48.640><c> it</c>

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 align:start position:0%
destroy our industry on that and it's it
 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
destroy our industry on that and it's it

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 align:start position:0%
gets very very very messy and they're
 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.450 align:start position:0%
gets very very very messy and they're
not<00:00:51.399><c> moving</c><00:00:51.910><c> ahead</c><00:00:52.270><c> as</c><00:00:52.660><c> fast</c><00:00:52.870><c> as</c><00:00:53.170><c> they</c><00:00:53.320><c> should</c>

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
not moving ahead as fast as they should
 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
not moving ahead as fast as they should
because<00:00:54.460><c> once</c><00:00:54.700><c> you</c><00:00:54.880><c> had</c><00:00:55.059><c> a</c><00:00:55.090><c> yeast</c><00:00:55.989><c> African</c>

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 align:start position:0%
because once you had a yeast African
 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.370 align:start position:0%
because once you had a yeast African

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
was that was real I think investors
 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
was that was real I think investors
would<00:01:01.960><c> come</c><00:01:02.200><c> in</c><00:01:02.350><c> because</c><00:01:02.710><c> the</c><00:01:02.829><c> markets</c><00:01:03.219><c> would</c>

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 align:start position:0%
