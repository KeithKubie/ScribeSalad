00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.700
So the only allele combination in this list

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.960
that should show signs of lactose intolerance would

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.750
be the cytosine cytosine combination, or the CC.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.850
And the reason is because. Remember that the

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:13.682
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:16.562
causes non lactase persistence, right? We need lactase

00:00:16.562 --> 00:00:19.698
to digest lactose. Without it, we'll be lactose intolerant.

00:00:19.698 --> 00:00:22.520
So if we have 2 cytosines, then, obviously. We're

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.350
probably going to show symptoms of lactose intolerance. But if

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.580
we have one copy of the T allele, right

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.750
if we have a cytosine and some thiamine. One

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.050
copy by itself is enough to produce some lactase

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.890
into adulthood. This presumably would be enough to mitigate

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.030
any effects of lactose intolerance, right cause now we're

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.840
going to have some lactase around we can digest our

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.520
lactose. If it's digested, then we're not going to

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.800
show those symptoms of lactose intolerance. So even one

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.840
copy is enough to not be lactose intolerance. And

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.380
of course, having two copies of the T allele

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.570
would also most likely make you not show signs

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.970
of lactose intolerance, because then you'd have plenty of lactase.
