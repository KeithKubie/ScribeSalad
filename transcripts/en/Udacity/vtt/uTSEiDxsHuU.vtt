00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.190
Let's add one final scale to
our line creation toolbox.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.620
Let's figure out how we can go from
two points to the equation of a line.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.730
So, let's say we had two points.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.975
The first point is at
the coordinates (1,8) and

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:15.793
the second is at coordinates (3,12).

00:00:15.793 --> 00:00:19.940
And let's say, I want to write
the equation of this line, and

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.060
I want to write it in slope
intercept form, y equals mx plus b.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.730
Which means I need to find m and
I need to find b.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.730
M I can get using the slope
equation we learned about earlier.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.439
And this is that equation.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.880
M equals y2- y1 over x2- x1.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.131
Which in this case y2 would be the y
coordinate 0.2 which is 12- y1

00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:45.780
which is the y coordinate 0.1 which is 8

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.820
divided by x2 which is
three minus x1 which is 1.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.420
This gives me four over two or two.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.070
So I know the slope of my line.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.900
To get the y intercept,

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.290
we can use the point slope form
just like we did last time.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.989
So remember, we want to write
the equation of this line.

00:01:06.028 --> 00:01:08.160
And we're going to do it
in point slope form so

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.560
that we can eventually get to y=mx+b.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.300
So can you help me fill
in the blanks here?

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.940
Enter your values for y1,
m and x1 in these blanks.
