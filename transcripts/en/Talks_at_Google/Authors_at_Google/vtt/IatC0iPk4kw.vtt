00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.180
LEV GROSSMAN: My mom is English
and she grew up in London.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.870
And like the
[INAUDIBLE] kids, she

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.236
was evacuated from London
to escape the blitz

00:00:19.236 --> 00:00:20.569
during World War II.

00:00:20.569 --> 00:00:22.110
Although unlike the
[INAUDIBLE] kids,

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.590
she did not find her way
into a secret, magical world

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.870
of talking animals.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.030
And in fact, apparently,
she was so naughty,

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.360
in her host family's house that
they sent her back to London,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.450
because being bombed by Hitler
was like a suitable punishment

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.770
for whatever it is she did.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.070
I never found out what it was.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.860
And then years later,
she went to Oxford

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.730
and she was on her way to her
final exams her senior year,

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.334
and she stopped in to a
pub for a pint, as one did.

00:00:53.334 --> 00:00:55.000
And there was this
old gaffer at the end

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.940
of the bar, who
said well, you're

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.030
going to take your orals,
you know, you should probably

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.880
have a brandy.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.970
And my mom had never
had brandy before.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.390
But, the guy at the end
of the bar was CS Lewis.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.170
And if CS Lewis
offers you a Brandy,

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.170
you're going to drink that
brandy, which she did.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.300
She claims to have no
memory of anything else that

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.710
happened that day.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.370
But she did get a first.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.780
So it all worked out OK.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.325
So I was a fantasy fan
as a kid, especially,

00:01:29.325 --> 00:01:30.950
"the Lion, the Witch
and the Wardrobe,"

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.820
which was for me-- I'd read
it when I was about eight.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.400
And for me it was the novel that
taught me what novels are for,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.050
what they do for you, which is
to take you away to somewhere

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.360
more interesting temporarily.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.675
But I was also into Tolkien.

00:01:50.675 --> 00:01:52.300
I was especially into T.H White.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.080
"The Once and Future King."

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.720
I read Piers Anthony.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.710
Not many people cop to
Piers Anthony anymore,

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.860
but Piers Anthony was
great, huge influence on me.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.830
As far as I know
he's still writing.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.980
I made it to, "Golem
in the Gears,"

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.550
and I think I crapped
out around then.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.880
But those books were
really important to me.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.680
Anne McCaffrey, Fritz
Lieber, who as far as I know

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.080
is not even in print anymore.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.160
I read the, "Fafhrd and
the Gray Mouser" books

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.434
more than I read Tolkien.

00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:23.850
If you haven't
read them, I think,

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.475
"Swords and Deviltry"
is the first one.

00:02:25.475 --> 00:02:28.070
They're truly fantastic.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.170
Michael Moorcock, all the rest
of those writers-- Ursula Le

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.450
Guin.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.650
I was deeply obsessed with
them and immersed in them.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.540
And I remain so when I
grew up, which I think

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.540
was dismaying to my parents.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.340
The other thing I'll say
about the house I grew up in,

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.356
it was slightly odd in
that my parents were

00:02:49.356 --> 00:02:50.355
both English professors.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.435
It was a hyper
literary household.

00:02:56.435 --> 00:02:58.390
It was just stuffed with books.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.250
My parents had fancy degrees.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.930
They taught at
fancy universities.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.150
They were kind of high priest
and priestess of the canon

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.320
of the great books.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.210
And I think that
they had anticipated

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.020
that I would grow out of
fantasy and at some point

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.240
cease to be obsessed with it.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.630
But someone asked China Mieville
once how he got into fantasy.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.450
And he said, "how did
you get out of it?"

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.800
Fantasy always stayed with me.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.110
It always remained important
to me, even after I grew up.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.960
I went to college, I
studied literature.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.800
I went to graduate school in
comparative literature, sort

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.230
of following in my
parents footsteps.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.620
But something sort
of odd happened.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.580
I mean, I still read
fantasy that entire time.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.090
It was sort of
driven underground

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.900
by like, the pressure
of the cannon

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.740
pressing down on it from above.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.380
But I always kind of
kept faith with it.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.400
And I read it constantly.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.440
And I only intermittently
thought about writing fantasy.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.600
I think it was 1996, I reread
the, "Wizard of Earthsea"

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.140
books.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.190
And I had remembered them--
I always loved the bits where

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.650
he's on the island of Roke.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.089
And he's getting his
magical education.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:20.850
And I remember that as being
like two-thirds of the book

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:21.399
on Roke.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:23.600
And it's actually
like two chapters.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.470
And I had this killer idea.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.390
What if we did a whole
book that was set entirely

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.670
at a school for magic.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.990
I literally have the
notes for this idea, which

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.480
occurred to me in 1996,
just like the last instant

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.330
before Harry Potter
came into the world.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.360
I probably could not have beaten
Rowling to a market anyway.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.190
But, as it happens, because I'm
an idiot, I shelved this idea,

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.580
and I didn't come
back to it until 2004,

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.900
which was a complicated
year for me personally.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.560
I had at that point--
I was a writer already.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.830
I had published two novels.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.900
But I was painfully aware
that for whatever reason,

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.470
I had not found my voice
as a fiction writer,

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.180
which, two books
into your career,

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.420
it's a bit late to be
finding your voice.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.300
But I was very
conscious that I had not

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.530
been able to say what it
was that I wanted to say.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.080
And I was working, pretty
much in the mode of my sort

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.410
of high literary heroes.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.500
I imagined myself as a literary
novelist, in like, you know,

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.520
your Jonathan Franzen,
your Zadie Smith.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.310
I sort of imagined
that as the path.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.850
But when it got to
be 2004, a number

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.030
of really important
things happened to me.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.220
I had my first child.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.300
I read "Johnathan Strange &amp;
Mr. Norrell," by Susanna Clark.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.670
Not as important as my
first child, but still

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.730
a very important
experience for me.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.440
And maybe most
important, I turned

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:05.010
35, which experts disagree
as to whether 35 counts

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.150
as sort of early middle age.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.330
But it was not totally
deniable that I might possibly

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.290
be entering early middle age.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.140
And because death was
hovering at my shoulder,

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.030
I began to think really
seriously about what

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.480
I should do for my next book.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.630
My first book had taken
me five years to write.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.422
My second book took
me six years to write.

00:06:28.422 --> 00:06:30.630
These are books that should
not have taken that long.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.760
Something was not
really clicking for me,

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.670
and I had embarked already
on something else, which

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:38.630
wasn't panning out.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.046
Oh, the other thing
that happen is

00:06:40.046 --> 00:06:43.360
that my brother sent me a
draft of his novel in progress.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.980
I have a twin brother
who's also a writer.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:53.070
Up until that time, he had
been a designer of video games.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.420
But for some reason, it
occurred to him to kind of horn

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.290
in on my turf, and he was
going to write a novel too.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.790
And I was all like, that's super
cute that you're doing that.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.810
And then he sent me the first
five chapters of his book

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.260
and it was incredible.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.707
It was so good.

00:07:09.707 --> 00:07:11.540
And it was so much
better than anything else

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.400
that I had ever written.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.980
And this filled me
with a great rage.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.184
And it caused me to reconsider
many of my life choices.

00:07:20.184 --> 00:07:21.600
The book, by the
way, it's called,

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.920
"Soon I'll Be Invincible."

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.400
It was published in 2007.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.150
It's totally-- it's
totally fantastic.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.790
You'll see what I mean
when you pick it up.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:36.860
So I sort of withdrew
into my fastness

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:41.160
and started thinking about, what
was the most important reading

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.360
experience of my life
that I had ever had?

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.810
What was most compelling,
the most immersive novel

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:48.870
I had read?

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.950
And I kept coming back
to, "The Lion, the Witch

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.639
and the Wardrobe."

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:56.180
And I wondered if
there was something

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.554
that I could do,
something that i

00:07:57.554 --> 00:08:00.220
could try to write
that would give people

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.870
that same experience.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.960
And, you know, it was an
interesting moment for fantasy,

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.090
because things had been sort of
changing seismically in fantasy

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.480
for a while at that point.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:19.259
When I was a kid, this was
pre-internet-- being a fantasy

00:08:19.259 --> 00:08:21.550
fan felt sort of different
because you weren't as aware

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.770
that other people were into it.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.700
It felt as though
that it was this thing

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:31.520
that you did privately because
something was wrong with you.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.623
And you didn't really
understand that there

00:08:33.623 --> 00:08:35.539
were all these other
people out there for whom

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:36.539
it was really important.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:38.860
It wasn't until--
really it wasn't

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:44.490
until Harry Potter happened,
at which, I think not

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.530
coincidentally happened
at the same time

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:50.960
the web was really going
mainstream that you understood

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.770
that you weren't alone.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:55.160
That there were
millions of other people

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:59.570
who cared about this stuff,
and to whom it was important.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:03.760
And at the same time,
fantasy was changing.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.890
People, including
myself, often forget

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:11.950
that George R.R. Martin had
published Game of Thrones--

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.360
I think it was '96, '95.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.870
I think it was '96.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.110
So he was publishing, "A Song
of Ice and Fire," those novels.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.900
And those novels changed
everything for me.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.190
He's super famous
and people love him.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.170
I think he still underrated.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.520
I think people still don't
understand how radically he

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.080
changed fantasy by rewriting
the epic tradition,

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.070
rewriting Tolkien
in the way that he

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.430
did, as if it were history,
written straight ahead

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:44.930
for adults, in realist
language, full of all the kind

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.980
of moral gray areas and
really horrible things

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.900
of which history is full.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:54.196
It was just-- it was a seismic
experience, reading him.

00:09:54.196 --> 00:09:56.570
And he was-- you know, he was
the thin edge of the wedge.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:00.220
Philip Pullman was
really important for me.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.720
That was late '90s.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:08.070
American Gods by Neil Gaiman
came out, I think in 2001.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:12.850
And then "Jonathan Strange &amp;
Mr. Norrell," came out in 2004.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:14.740
And when I read
that, I thought, you

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.380
know, it was no
longer possible, even

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.760
for as obtuse an
individual as myself,

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.150
to ignore that something really
interesting was happening.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.170
"Jonathan Strange
&amp; Mr. Norrell,"

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.150
it's a book that I love.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.880
And I think it affected
me particularly

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:36.610
because it does all the things
that literary fiction is

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:37.270
supposed to do.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:39.430
It's moving in that way.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:46.020
It's ambiguous and strange and
beautiful and melancholy and

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.504
funny.

00:10:47.504 --> 00:10:49.420
It does all these things
that literary fiction

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.760
is supposed to do, and it does
all the fantasy things too.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.890
And I just-- I didn't understand
that that was possible.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:59.850
And reading it was just--
it was electrifying.

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:02.010
It was within a
week of finishing

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:12.580
that book that I started
writing, "The Magicians."

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:16.810
When I think of it now, it seems
like the natural thing for me

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:17.510
to have done.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.600
It was surprisingly
difficult for me

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.890
to do that, I think in part,
because although I always

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.565
was a fantasy reader, I never
thought of myself as a fantasy

00:11:26.565 --> 00:11:27.065
reader.

00:11:27.065 --> 00:11:30.160
I always imagined myself
as a literary guy,

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.090
who would in future
collect Pulitzers and Nobel

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:36.670
Prizes in great numbers.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.270
Making that decision to
be a fantasy writer, it's

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.620
an interesting one,
because you kind of opt out

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:45.350
of a certain-- you
know, there's still

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.930
a level at which literary
culture discriminates

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.900
against fantasy, and a
lot of genre fiction.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.890
The same value is
not attached to it

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:59.610
as is attached to some of
those other literary books.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:01.740
And we sell better
than them so it's OK.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.950
But still, it was
a surprising thing.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:06.750
I knew that my parents
would be shocked.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:09.910
And it's sad to think
that my solo act, I think,

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.880
as far as I can remember
of adolescent rebellion was

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.540
writing a fantasy
novel when I was 35.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.530
But that was it.

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:18.740
And it was exciting.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.940
It was thrilling to know-- and I
was writing and I was thinking,

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:22.840
this is crazy.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.380
They're never going to
let me get away with this.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:29.410
It was very fun, and if
any of you write fiction,

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:32.500
if you feel as though a silent
alarm has been tripped when

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.260
you're writing something,
that is always a good sign

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.310
that you are on something.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:42.670
And that's how I felt.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.280
But it was when I
started to write--

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.810
I dusted off my idea of
writing about the education

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:49.740
of a wizard.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.300
Which is an odd thing.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:57.430
It was an odd thing to write
about for a fantasy writer,

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:05.460
especially in that moment, 2004,
because we were at peak-Potter.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.640
We're still at peak-Potter.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.560
But we were at
peak-Potter at that point.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.170
It was in between,
"Order of the Phoenix,"

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:14.840
and, "Half-Blood Prince."

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:21.400
And that subject, the education
of a wizard, that was owned.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:25.550
That was owned by J.K. Rowling.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.570
And yet I couldn't let go of it.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:28.920
I kept coming back to it.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.270
And

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:36.110
I felt so closely identified
with Harry, and also with Lyra

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:37.380
from, "His Dark Materials."

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.740
It was a major one for me too.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:42.460
I felt sure that there must
be a way for me to make

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:46.780
this topic, this story, my own.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.660
And the way I
ended up doing it--

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.591
I was conscious that I
identified so closely

00:13:52.591 --> 00:13:54.340
with these characters,
and yet my life was

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.750
very different from theirs.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:57.810
I was 35.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:59.190
I had a child.

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:04.030
I was paying estimated quarterly
taxes which Harry never does.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.670
He never has to do that.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.550
You ought to hear
about it if he does.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.700
I felt as though the
problems that I was wrestling

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.970
with in my life were so
different from the ones

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:15.560
that he was confronting.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.070
And I kept thinking,
is there a way for me

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:21.480
to write a story like this
story about a young man who

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.780
is discovering that he
has power that he didn't

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.940
know that he had, who
finds his way into a world

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.270
that nobody else knows exists.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:32.050
But to write it for
adults, and somehow

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:35.000
make it about the
things that I felt

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.674
like I was struggling with.

00:14:38.674 --> 00:14:40.090
So almost as a
thought experiment,

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:42.070
I started writing this story.

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:46.920
And you know, I
changed it to make

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.410
it look closer like my life.

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:55.360
I moved it to America, which was
itself actually a major thing.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.010
I was writing in a tradition
that was very English--

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:01.570
the Lewis tradition,
the Pullman tradition.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:04.150
Just to move that
story to America

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.812
felt weird and kind of radical.

00:15:05.812 --> 00:15:07.270
The characters were
not-- you know,

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:08.728
the characters in
those books, they

00:15:08.728 --> 00:15:11.330
talk in this marvelously correct
English, where they actually

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:15.240
articulate very well, and they
never call each other dude,

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.220
and their sentences and
paragraph are perfect.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.750
Just to have the characters
talking like American kids

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:25.910
immediately felt funny and
kind of interesting to me

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.340
and different.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.890
And so I decided
that I would use

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.480
a different kind of language.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.250
I wanted to see what it
was like to write fantasy,

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:39.450
but using the literary
language of realism.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.320
What if you were to
write about magic,

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.690
but you try to
describe it, you know,

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:51.330
the way Hemingway would describe
a bullfight or Virginia Woolf

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:54.680
would describe, I don't
know, a beach or a table

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.180
or some flowers
or a busy street.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.985
Just to write it in that
straight ahead kind of way.

00:16:00.985 --> 00:16:02.620
Not as well, because
I'm not as good

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.540
a writer as Hemingway or Woolf.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:08.900
But to approach it in
that way and try to shed,

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.560
I guess, some of
the common tropes

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.697
that we associate with magic.

00:16:12.697 --> 00:16:15.280
Just actually to actually look
at the magic in this very close

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.760
way-- those writers like
Hemingway and Woolf,

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.090
the modernists, they
were the absolute masters

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:22.600
of observing the
world around them.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.430
Nobody else had ever noticed
the world around them the way

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.760
those people did
and record of it.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:33.439
And I always felt that if
I had a beef with fantasy,

00:16:33.439 --> 00:16:34.980
and the way people
write about magic,

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.720
it was as if they just didn't
describe it closely enough.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.930
I always felt so
the camera cut away,

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:43.660
and like I didn't quite see
everything I wanted to see.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:45.830
What if you just kept
the camera on there,

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:48.480
you saw exactly what the person
was doing with their hands.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.870
You heard the kind of-- what
does the magic sound like?

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:53.050
What sort of fizzy
noises does it make?

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:54.560
What does it smell like?

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.660
Does it leaves something in
the air after it's been cast.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:03.450
You know, I really want to get
precise and clear in that way.

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:06.569
And then, you know,
I wanted the story,

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:10.020
while structurally resembling
a lot of the stories

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.910
that I'd read, to be
about different things.

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.540
Which meant that they had
to be altered in some ways.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:19.200
I wasn't going to write
about little kids.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.060
I aged the characters
up so that they were-- I

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:25.010
think Quentin's 17
when the books start.

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:28.440
I wanted to make them drink.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.580
I wanted them to have sex lives.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.310
I want them to have
mood disorders.

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:41.040
I wanted to leave in some of the
things that get airbrushed out

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.197
of a lot of fantasy,
just because that's

00:17:43.197 --> 00:17:44.280
the way that it's written.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.560
That's the convention
of the genre.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.290
I mean, you know there's a lot
of sex happening at Hogwarts.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:53.360
It's way beyond snogging, and
it's just happening just out

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.650
of frame, you know.

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.470
The people are just,
they're going at it.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:18:00.100
And the camera just
doesn't quite capture it.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.010
What if you just sort
of expanded the frame

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:05.320
and put that stuff in there?

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:08.280
So that was part
of the experiment.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.030
And it was going to be a
different kind of story.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:21.080
What if you took away the
sort of avuncular adviser

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:24.670
figure, which is such
a staple of fantasy.

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:28.400
You so often have a
Gandalf or a Dumbledore.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:33.690
Somebody who's there, who when
the main character wanders

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:36.700
a little bit off the path
and gets confused about what

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.380
he or she is
supposed to be doing,

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.820
takes them by the shoulders
and just says, look, you know,

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.184
we have this evil ring.

00:18:43.184 --> 00:18:45.100
It's a terrible thing
and the world is ending,

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.730
but you see that
volcano over there?

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:50.380
Just go to the volcano, put
the ring in the volcano,

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.350
and then everything's
going to be fine.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:54.500
There's a lot of orcs
between here and the volcano,

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.340
but that's what
you're going to do.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.350
I always felt that there
was nobody in my life,

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:01.440
in particular, who was giving
me that kind of advice.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:07.200
Or they were but they were
just as full of crap as I was.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.350
It was at a time in my life when
I personally felt very lost,

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:15.160
and I wanted my characters to
feel lost in that same way.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:22.120
I really felt as though, you
know, in a wizard's life,

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.900
the '20s is not a decade that
you hear very much about.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.546
You often meet wizards
when they are small,

00:19:27.546 --> 00:19:28.920
or wizards when
they're super old

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.970
and they have big long beards.

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:33.440
But what is it like when
they're first finding their way

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.630
and trying to figure out what
to do with all this magic

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:38.780
that they've just learned?

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.030
I wanted to write
a book about that.

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:45.270
Likewise, what if you subtract
the big bad from the equation?

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:48.970
What if you write a story like
this, but there's no Voldemort,

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:51.600
and there's no White
White, there's no Sauron.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.340
What happens if you remove
that person from the equation?

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.340
Those people, while they do
many terrible things that

00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:59.870
are regrettable,
they have this sort

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:04.490
of wonderful organizing
influence on the universes

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:05.910
that they inhabit.

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:10.070
Very much of a time, with some
notable exceptions, like Snape,

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.036
you can tell which
side people are on.

00:20:12.036 --> 00:20:13.410
You know it they're
a death eater

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:16.770
or you know their trying
to stop the death eaters.

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:18.310
You know that
you're good or bad.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:20.260
Everybody knows what
side that they're on,

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.230
what team they're playing for.

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:25.085
Well likewise, there was
nobody like that in my world.

00:20:25.085 --> 00:20:28.820
I didn't know who was
good and who was bad.

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.486
I didn't know if
I was good or bad.

00:20:31.486 --> 00:20:32.860
I didn't know if
what I was doing

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.160
was the right or wrong thing.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.031
And even after I
had done it, I still

00:20:36.031 --> 00:20:37.530
don't know if it
was the right thing

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:40.090
to have done, because
nobody ever told me.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:43.805
You know, there was no answers
at the back of the book.

00:20:43.805 --> 00:20:45.430
And I want to write
a story about that,

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:48.250
which turned out to be a
very different kind of story.

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.580
It was much less a
story about using

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.080
magic to fight
evil and much more

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.300
a story about people
just trying to figure out

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:58.300
what magic was for.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:04.110
So I did that.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:07.030
And they have been
looking now, trying

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:10.750
to figure out what magic
is for, for three books.

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:13.482
And the Magician's
Land is the third one,

00:21:13.482 --> 00:21:14.940
in which they figure
out the extent

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:18.040
that they're ever going to
figure out what magic is for.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.810
And I'm going to read you
a short passage from it,

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:27.450
which I don't think requires
terribly much set up.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:34.490
It takes place in a magical
land called Fillory,

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:38.170
which, for legal purposes,
bears no resemblance whatsoever

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:40.880
to Narnia.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.880
But in some accidental ways,
unintended, may in some ways

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.380
resemble it.

00:21:47.067 --> 00:21:47.900
It's called Fillory.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:51.300
And at the beginning
of the books-- people,

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.131
they know about Fillory, but
they don't know that it's real.

00:21:54.131 --> 00:21:55.880
One of the things that
was important to me

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.520
about the hero, Quentin, and
really all the characters,

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:03.299
is that they read books.

00:22:03.299 --> 00:22:05.840
One of the things that I always
thought was funny about Harry

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:10.860
is that, as far as I can tell,
Harry has never read a novel.

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.770
You would think that,
you know, having spent

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:16.770
so much of his early
life, locked in a closet,

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:21.230
with his abusive kind
of adoptive family,

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:23.750
all he would have
done would be to read

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:26.850
and re-read the Narnia books,
over and over and over again.

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.890
But as far as I can tell,
he's never read them.

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.590
I mean, I know
Hermione's read them,

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:34.240
but she never talks about it.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.740
Except for, "Beedle
the Bard," there

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.530
is no fiction in the Hogwarts
library, which I always

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:40.405
thought was very
interesting and I understood

00:22:40.405 --> 00:22:41.840
why Rowling went that way.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:45.070
But I was thought,
if it were really

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:48.210
to happen-- if there were to
be a school for magic, then

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.880
the people who went there
would actually be huge fantasy

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.570
nerds, lots of them.

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.590
And they would arrive at
the school having read

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:56.294
a lot of fantasy literature.

00:22:56.294 --> 00:22:58.460
And it would in some ways
be very confusing to them,

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:01.029
as it is confusing
for Quentin, who

00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:03.320
has grown up reading these
books, which are the Fillory

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:03.820
books.

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:10.250
He loves them and when he
arrives at Brakebills, which

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:14.830
is the school for
magic, he naturally

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:17.590
imagines that he's kind of going
to be the hero of a fantasy

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:20.500
novel, like the
books that he's read.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:23.440
And of course, real life
isn't like that at all.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.280
And so he gets his
magical education,

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.675
he's forced to-- he undergoes
a series of disappointments

00:23:28.675 --> 00:23:30.050
when he realizes
that life really

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:32.190
isn't like stories at all.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:35.399
And really just beginning
as a matter of realism,

00:23:35.399 --> 00:23:37.690
I feel like he would have
read a lot of fantasy novels.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:39.700
The book actually became
a little bit about,

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:43.980
what is that difference
between fiction and reality?

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:48.140
Why is reality so much less
well organized than fiction,

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:52.020
and frequently so much
less satisfying than it?

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:56.046
So we have this land of Fillory,
which turns out to be real.

00:23:56.046 --> 00:23:57.420
And the passage
I'm going to read

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.980
is actually not from
Quentin's point of view.

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.355
It's from the point of view
of a character named Elliott,

00:24:01.355 --> 00:24:03.950
who is a friend of Quentin's.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.650
He comes from our world,
but he has gone over

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:10.940
to Fillory and become
the High King there.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:14.502
And as frequently happens
with magical lands,

00:24:14.502 --> 00:24:17.710
Fillory is being
invaded by Its neighbors

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:20.735
to the north, who are
called the Lorians.

00:24:25.236 --> 00:24:29.810
This is Elliot reacting to news
that the Lorians are invading

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:32.270
and figuring out how
he's going to repel them.

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:39.680
"We he first got the news that
the Lorians were invading,

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.700
it had been grimly exciting.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.860
Antique formulas
and protocols were

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:49.030
invoked, a lot of serious
looking non-ceremonial armor

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:52.490
and weapons and flags and tack
had come up out of storage

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:56.880
and been polished and
sharpened and oiled.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.150
They brought up with
them a lot of dust too

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:04.600
and a thrilling smell of great
deeds and legendary times.

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.900
An epic smell.

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.880
Elliot breathed it in deep.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.530
The invasion was not
a complete surprise.

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:14.120
The Lorians were
always up some kind

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.400
of bad behavior in the
books-- kidnapping princes,

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.430
forcing talking
horses to plow fields,

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:22.640
trying to get everybody
to believe in their slave

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.725
quasi-Norse gods.

00:25:24.725 --> 00:25:26.600
But it had been centuries
since they actually

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.530
crossed the border and forests.

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:30.810
They were usually too busy
fighting among themselves

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:33.020
to get organized.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.300
Eliot moved rapidly
to expel the Lorians,

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.290
although he found
himself reluctant to be

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:40.710
the direct cause of
any actual killing.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:43.130
This wasn't Tolkien, these
weren't orcs and trolls

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:45.845
and giant spiders and
whatever else-- evil creatures

00:25:45.845 --> 00:25:47.780
that you were free
to commit genocide

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.366
on without any complicated
moral ramifications.

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:57.490
Orcs didn't have wives
and kids and back stories,

00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:59.480
but he was pretty sure
the Lorians were human,

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.075
and killing them would
be basically murder.

00:26:02.075 --> 00:26:03.970
And that wasn't going to happen.

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.530
Some of them were
even kind of hot.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:09.360
Anyway those Tolkien books
were fiction, and Elliott,

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.430
as High King of Fillory
didn't deal in fiction.

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:16.060
He was in the messy
business of writing facts.

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:19.260
It was a tricky,
ticklish business.

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:23.500
There was nothing in Elliot's
admittedly limited experience

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:26.810
more tedious than virtue.

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:28.790
Fortunately, the Fillorians
had an advantage,

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:31.220
which was that they had
every possible advantage.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.214
They out-matched the Lorians
in every stat you could name.

00:26:34.214 --> 00:26:36.130
The Lorians where a bunch
of guys with swords.

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:40.340
The Fillorians were every beast
in the monster manual, led

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.640
by a click of wizard
kings and queens,

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.410
and Elliott was
very sorry, but you

00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:46.620
knew that when you invaded us.

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.980
See, the Lorians had made
a mistake on their way

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.370
down from the northern
barrier range.

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:56.740
They set some trees on
fire, and an outlying farm,

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.410
and they killed a hermit.

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:01.970
Even Janet was surprised
by Eliot's anger.

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:05.180
I mean, she was furious,
but she was Janet.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.350
She was pissed off all the time.

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:11.150
Poppy and Josh looked grim
which is how they got angry.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:12.370
But Elliott's rage was crazy.

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:13.320
It was over the top.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.440
They burned tree?

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.100
His trees.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.400
They killed a hermit.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.801
They killed a hermit.

00:27:20.801 --> 00:27:22.800
Where Fillory and the
Fillorians were concerned,

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.020
Elliot no longer had any irony.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:28.310
His heart went out to
that weird, solitary man,

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:30.310
in his uncomfortable hut.

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:32.120
He'd never met him.

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.910
They wouldn't have had much to
say to each other if they had.

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:38.350
But whoever that hermit
was, he obviously despised

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:43.730
his fellow man, and that meant
that he was OK in Eliot's book.

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:44.990
And now he was dead.

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:46.920
Elliott was going to
destroy the Lorians.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.440
He would annihilate them!

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.790
He was going to murder them!

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:53.872
Not murder murder.

00:27:53.872 --> 00:27:56.930
But he was going to
mess them up good.

00:27:56.930 --> 00:28:00.230
Elliot went alone,
disguised as a peasant.

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:02.190
He waited in the
middle of the road.

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:04.070
He didn't move.

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:07.890
He let them notice
him gradually.

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:09.800
The man leading the
front lines stepped out

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.150
to invite him,
not very politely,

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:15.560
to kindly get out of the way
or 1,000 Lorian linebackers

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:19.660
would pull his guts out
and strangle him with them.

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:20.800
Eliot smiled.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.960
He shuffled his feet
humbly for a second,

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.985
and then he punched
the guy in the face.

00:28:25.985 --> 00:28:28.040
It took the man by surprise.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:33.639
'Get the fuck out of my
country, asshole,' Eliot said.

00:28:33.639 --> 00:28:35.055
He knew we hadn't
done much damage

00:28:35.055 --> 00:28:36.638
and that he wouldn't
get another shot,

00:28:36.638 --> 00:28:38.310
so he held up his
left hand and he

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:41.210
force pushed back
the man so hard,

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:44.940
he brought six ranks of
Lorians down with him.

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:46.810
It felt good.

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:49.250
Elliott had no
children, but this

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:53.040
must be what protecting
your children felt like.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.424
He just wished Quentin
could have seen it.

00:28:55.424 --> 00:28:56.840
He dropped the
cloak, and stood up

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.330
straight in his
royal arraignment,

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:01.320
so it was clear that he was
a king, and not a peasant.

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.100
A couple of eager beaver arrows
came arcing over from back

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:08.602
in the ranks, and he burned them
up in flight, puff puff, puff.

00:29:08.602 --> 00:29:12.330
It was easy when you were
this angry, and this good.

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:16.110
And god, he was angry, and good.

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:19.980
He tapped the butt of his
staff once on the ground--

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.000
earthquake.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.805
All 1,000 Lorians fell down
on their stupid, violent asses

00:29:24.805 --> 00:29:28.470
in magnificent synchrony.

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:29.850
He couldn't just
do that at will.

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:32.225
He'd been out here all last
night, setting up the spells,

00:29:32.225 --> 00:29:34.960
but it was a great effect,
especially since the Lorians

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.690
didn't know that.

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:39.270
He allowed it to sink in.

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:42.090
And then he undid a spell.

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:46.660
He made the army behind
him visible, or most of it.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:47.990
Take a good look, gentleman.

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:50.280
Those ones with the horse
bodies are the hippogriffs.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:52.240
The griffins have
the lion bodies.

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.192
It's easy to mix 'em up.

00:29:54.192 --> 00:29:56.150
And then-- and he indulged
themselves here-- he

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:58.140
made the giants visible.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:01.490
You do not appreciate
at all from fairy tales

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:04.350
how unbelievably
terrifying a giant is.

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:06.610
These players were
seven-story giants,

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:08.350
and they did not mess around.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:10.950
In real life, humans
didn't slay giants

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:12.940
because it was impossible.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.020
It would be like
killing an apartment

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.385
building with your bare hands.

00:30:17.385 --> 00:30:19.760
It doesnt' make sense, because
apartment buildings aren't

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.322
alive, but you see
what I'm saying.

00:30:21.322 --> 00:30:23.030
They were even stronger
than they looked.

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:25.000
They had to be to beat
the square cube law that

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.760
made land organisms
that big physically

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.490
impossible in the real world.

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:31.049
And their skin was
half a foot thick.

00:30:31.049 --> 00:30:33.340
There were only a couple
dozen giants in all of Fillory

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:36.530
because, even Fillory's
hyper-abundant ecosystem could

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:38.150
not have fed more of them.

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:41.190
Six of them had come
out for the battle.

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:43.260
Nobody moved.

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:47.299
Instead, the Great
Salt River moved.

00:30:47.299 --> 00:30:48.340
It was right behind them.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.350
They had just crossed
it, and the nymphs

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:52.280
took it out of its
banks and straight

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:57.290
into the mass of the Lorian
army like an aimabled tsunami.

00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:59.679
A lot of the soldiers
got washed away.

00:30:59.679 --> 00:31:01.595
He had made the nymphs
promise to drown as few

00:31:01.595 --> 00:31:04.260
of them as possible, although
they were free to abuse them

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.845
in any other way they chose.

00:31:06.845 --> 00:31:08.470
Some of the ones who
weren't swept away

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:12.715
wanted to fight anyway, because
they were just that valiant.

00:31:12.715 --> 00:31:15.280
Eliot supposed they must
have had difficult childhoods

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.210
or something like that.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:19.910
Well, join the club, he thought.

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:22.260
It's not that exclusive.

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:25.890
He and his friends gave
them a difficult adulthood

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:26.880
to go with it."

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.720
Thank you.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:39.170
Now we do have two
microphones available

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:45.752
if anybody is interested in
and willing to ask a question.

00:31:45.752 --> 00:31:47.460
I'm always very grateful
to whoever will.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.459
I never ask questions
under these circumstances.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:52.660
Thank you.

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:53.550
Go ahead.

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:57.250
AUDIENCE: Hi, great talk
and I loved the excerpt.

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:58.750
I just have a really
quick question.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:03.030
So I'm now with fiction like
Game of Thrones coming out,

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:06.380
your novels which are much more
realistic, yours has much more

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:12.090
moral gray area, if
there's still a place for,

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:15.280
of if there will be
a place for-- it's

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.890
almost a pejorative
term, but escapism?

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:19.970
Or novels that
deal with escapism?

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:24.210
I mean, part of the function
of novels where the heroes are

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:25.866
good guys and the
bad guys are bad guys

00:32:25.866 --> 00:32:27.740
and the heroes are
honorable, and the bad guy

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:32.100
are just dastardly and there's
a titanic objects somewhere

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.880
in the distance, all that
kind of good stuff is, you,

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.130
after a long day go
home and read this book

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:41.240
and it's escapism, and
you don't necessarily

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.220
get all of the stuff you would
be reading Game of Thrones

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:48.380
or the Magician's
Trilogy, but you get that.

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.660
And I'm wondering if there's
a place for that still?

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:53.890
Or if that's going away, and if
we should be happy about that

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:56.371
if it is?

00:32:56.371 --> 00:32:58.370
LEV GROSSMAN: I'm going
to respectfully disagree

00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:59.786
with the premise
of your question.

00:32:59.786 --> 00:33:01.020
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:07.160
LEV GROSSMAN: I have never felt
that escapism was a real thing.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:10.660
To me-- and I say to me,
because literally this

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.800
is my personal opinion--
for at least for me

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.870
it's a fundamental
misunderstanding

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:20.120
of what reading does for me,
especially reading fantasy.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:24.050
You know, I think
it's an easy shot

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:28.370
to take to say that
fantasy is escapism,

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:33.680
it is a way of avoiding
the real world.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.924
This is obviously a
hobby horse of mine.

00:33:36.924 --> 00:33:38.590
Let's go back to the
18th century first.

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:45.980
You know, at some point
it was the 18th century.

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:50.220
Sort of, reading culture
developed a huge obsession

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.120
with realism.

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:54.130
Realism, for some reason,
clamped down on literature

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:58.730
and became the definition
of what literature was.

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:01.900
Fictional worlds were supposed
to look like the real world.

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:05.040
It's like around Robinson
Crusoe or something like that.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:09.699
And the other stuff, the fantasy
stuff, you know, the goblins ,

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:13.010
whatever else, it got pushed
into various different margins.

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:14.639
It got pushed down
to the children.

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:17.630
It got pushed off to
the supermarket racks,

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:21.290
you know, Gothic
literature, to the genres.

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:24.409
And this, you know,
death-grip of realism, it only

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:26.790
tightened when the
Modernists came along

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:29.449
who really codified it.

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:32.610
But that wasn't always the case.

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:36.834
You go back a little further,
you get into Shakespeare.

00:34:36.834 --> 00:34:38.000
Shakespeare's not a realist.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:45.167
He writes about witches,
ghosts, monsters, magic fairies.

00:34:45.167 --> 00:34:48.850
You know, anywhere back past
1700 and it's all fantasy.

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:50.409
That's what literature was.

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:53.100
And we don't think
of that as escapist.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:57.760
And what we think
of it is as a way

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:01.670
of confronting with, or
getting a grip on the problems

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:06.285
that we deal with in reality in
a kind of transmogrified form.

00:35:06.285 --> 00:35:10.050
You know, it's a way of
getting more direct access

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:14.700
to the junk that hangs down
underneath your conscious mind.

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:18.540
You know, you just you all those
subconscious monsters get out

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.622
and they start to look
like real monsters

00:35:20.622 --> 00:35:21.872
and you can wrestle with them.

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:26.600
That is what fantasy
is about for me.

00:35:30.085 --> 00:35:32.881
It's a way, not of
getting away from reality,

00:35:32.881 --> 00:35:34.630
it's another way of
coming at the problems

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:36.754
that you deal with in
reality, and getting traction

00:35:36.754 --> 00:35:39.580
on them form a slightly
different angle.

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:42.190
Somebody, and I forget
who it is, and I'm

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:48.300
going to mangle the quote,
said a very wise thing to me

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:54.630
once which was, "fantasy
isn't how we escape reality,

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:58.020
it's what we need in order
to be able to stay in reality

00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.530
and survive in it."

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:01.100
And I truly believe that.

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.650
I truly believe that.

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:06.490
And you know, it's partly--
and you do look back

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:13.680
at Tolkien and Lewis and it is
much clearer, the moral lines.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.370
You know, which is-- it's an
interesting complicated thing.

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:19.230
And I can only think that at
that historical moment, that's

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:20.220
what they needed.

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:23.080
And our moment is so much
different from theirs,

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:26.140
and we need something different.

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.170
There you have a personal
theory of mind, which

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:32.300
has no factual substantiation.

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:35.710
But it's how I think
about that question.

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:39.227
And who knows what fantasy is
going to start looking like.

00:36:39.227 --> 00:36:40.810
I don't know, but
it'll look like what

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:42.910
we need it to look like.

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:44.750
AUDIENCE: So a lot
of fantasy books

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:47.524
come in these series that
just sort of go on forever

00:36:47.524 --> 00:36:49.065
and ever and ever
and you can sort of

00:36:49.065 --> 00:36:51.394
continue to follow
Pug and whoever

00:36:51.394 --> 00:36:53.810
your favorite characters through
books and books and books

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:54.309
and books.

00:36:54.309 --> 00:36:57.200
So how do you feel about that?

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.867
Not with respect other people's,
but with your own world?

00:36:59.867 --> 00:37:01.450
I mean, is this a
world that you would

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:03.450
want to have inhabit
forever and ever and ever?

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:06.890
And have Quentin go on and
become an old geezer himself?

00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:10.230
Or is it something that you'd
want to see something new?

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:13.060
How do you feel about-- what are
your theories about these sorts

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:14.410
of trade-offs?

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:16.450
LEV GROSSMAN: Yeah,
well, they're evolving.

00:37:21.427 --> 00:37:22.010
Next question.

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:28.150
When I wrote, "The Magicians,"
I wrote it as a one-off.

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:30.790
It actually didn't occur
to me that I would never go

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:32.310
anywhere else with that story.

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:38.120
And that was partly because,
when I was writing it,

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.240
I was writing it on spec.

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.930
I had no idea it
would be published.

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:44.000
I wasn't really thinking
about the future.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:51.630
And then when it became a
trilogy, it was incredibly fun.

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:55.120
I really got to
explore this world.

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.660
But when I got to
the third book,

00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:01.097
I realized I needed to end it.

00:38:01.097 --> 00:38:02.805
For me as a writer,
there's a funny thing

00:38:02.805 --> 00:38:04.805
that happens when you're
writing a series, which

00:38:04.805 --> 00:38:08.000
is that you're playing this
delicate game in which you're

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.010
wrapping up, sort of the
local narrative threads.

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:13.340
And the broader
narrative threads

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:16.730
have to dangle
and keep on going.

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:18.580
You have to sort
of something back.

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:20.420
When I came to the
third book, I realized

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:21.640
that I needed a free hand.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.120
I needed to be able
to kill whoever

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:27.140
I wanted to kill, marry off
whoever I wanted to marry,

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.850
raze the cities, salt the Earth.

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:31.580
I felt like I had
to stop holding back

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:33.430
and just be able
to just do whatever

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:36.690
I like without an
eye on the next book.

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:40.290
Also I had run out of ideas.

00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:44.480
So, you know, so I'm
super pro-long series.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.070
And my hat is off to the
people who can sustain them,

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:49.920
like Martin.

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:53.620
But you know when
your business is

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:55.989
finished in a particular
universe, at least

00:38:55.989 --> 00:38:56.780
for the time being.

00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:00.580
I'm always mindful that Le Guin
went back to Earthsea, what,

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:02.430
20 years later?

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:07.040
Many years later, and realized
that she had something more

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.540
to say there.

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:13.460
And you know, I would never
rule that out about this world.

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:16.360
But I couldn't do the
balancing act any longer.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.340
I've given it up for now.

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.690
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you for coming here.

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:23.940
One way to think
about literary fiction

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:27.010
is that a set of techniques like
realism and a sort of concerns

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:29.422
that you can apply to
other things like fantasy.

00:39:29.422 --> 00:39:30.880
Another way to
think about it might

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:34.680
be as its own genre with its
own tropes and things like that.

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:38.577
I like, "The Magicians" a lot.

00:39:38.577 --> 00:39:40.160
If I had to criticize
it a little bit,

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:43.612
I might say it was much more
playful with the fantasy tropes

00:39:43.612 --> 00:39:45.820
then it was about any of
the literary fiction tropes.

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:50.750
I wonder if you think
of literary fiction

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:54.310
as a genre like
that, or not, or why?

00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:56.720
LEV GROSSMAN: It's a
really important question.

00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:00.347
And I do think of it that way.

00:40:00.347 --> 00:40:02.680
Another quote which I will
mangle and fail to attribute,

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:05.344
because I can't remember
who said it-- somebody once

00:40:05.344 --> 00:40:07.010
said about literary
fiction, "the sooner

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:10.120
that literary fiction
can wake up and recognize

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:13.890
it's status as a genre, the
sooner it can get the help

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:16.490
it so desperately needs."

00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:19.180
There is a sense, you
know, that literary fiction

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:22.610
that holds itself apart that
has a sort of exceptionalism

00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:23.936
about it.

00:40:23.936 --> 00:40:26.330
But it is another genre.

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:31.000
And yeah, it's true.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.570
I mean, I thought a lot
about "The Magicians" books

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:43.590
as a collision between
literary fiction and fantasy.

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:47.152
And I guess in that collision,
if one of the bodies

00:40:47.152 --> 00:40:49.110
crumpled more than the
other, it was definitely

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:50.080
fantasy that crumpled.

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:56.270
And, you know, I'm aware that.

00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:58.920
The model for them was
very much Watchmen.

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:03.570
Watchman was-- I'm super old so
I read Watchmen in high school

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:05.090
when it first came out.

00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:07.590
And it was totally
transformative for me.

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:09.834
And I often thought, when
I was trying to figure out

00:41:09.834 --> 00:41:12.125
what the model was for the
magicians, it was, you know,

00:41:12.125 --> 00:41:15.590
to try to interrogate the
fantasy genre in the same way

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:19.390
that Moore and Gibbons
interrogated the superhero

00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:22.010
story.

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:25.050
Now to write the Watchmen
of literary fiction-- well,

00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:29.010
I mean, in some ways I felt
that work had been done

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:32.160
by people like Joyce and Woolf.

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:43.050
They took the
Victorian novel, they

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:46.010
sort of looked at the kind
of bland epistemological

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:48.240
certainties of out of it
and just disassembled.

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.700
Took it to pieces and
just left it lying

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:56.160
and its component parts
on the garage floor.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.835
And said, just
look at this mess.

00:41:57.835 --> 00:41:59.680
You know, this
ridiculous machine.

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:01.530
We just took it apart for you.

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:03.990
And in a lot of ways,
I felt as though I

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:08.090
was doing something
radical to literary fiction

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:11.910
just by walking that back.

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:17.890
By writing a book that was about
the pleasure of storytelling,

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:21.990
that stopped saying, look how
false and wrong, you know,

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:24.410
these narratives are.

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:26.490
Let's stare at the
ways in which they

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:30.050
failed to represent reality,
and was a little bit more like,

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:33.050
actually let's go back and
see what they have to teach us

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:35.390
and why they're so pleasurable.

00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:37.840
But, yeah, I don't know.

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:40.070
I didn't know how
to get traction

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:41.640
on literary fiction
in the same way

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:45.860
that I felt like I had
something to say about fantasy.

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:48.920
But I'd love to read the book
that did it the other way.

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:53.700
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:55.990
So I've read the first
two chapters of the book

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:57.864
and I'm looking forward
to reading more of it

00:42:57.864 --> 00:42:58.590
after this talk.

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:00.760
So thank you for that.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.530
My question is about, kind of,
not about the series, not about

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:07.890
fantasy, but as you as a
writer, and as a critic.

00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:10.140
You could argue that, kind
of the rise of social media

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:14.869
has brought public figures
closer to the public.

00:43:14.869 --> 00:43:15.660
LEV GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:19.912
AUDIENCE: And I'm on a
website called Goodreads.

00:43:19.912 --> 00:43:21.120
LEV GROSSMAN: I know it well.

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:24.950
AUDIENCE: And you've been
very prevalent or very active

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:27.530
on your own Goodreads account.

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:29.924
Goodreads, for those
who don't know,

00:43:29.924 --> 00:43:32.340
is where you can keep track,
catalog the books that you've

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:36.990
read, write reviews, socialize,
join groups, join reading

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:39.452
challenges, things like that.

00:43:39.452 --> 00:43:40.660
So you have your own account.

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:45.050
You have books that you've read
and have a link to your blog.

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:48.490
And so you've been very active,
engaging with your audience.

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:50.700
Recently you've
also annotated one

00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:53.840
of the chapters of your
book on genius.com,

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:58.410
rapgenius.com, which I
thought was pretty cool.

00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:03.760
So my question is, as a
critic working for Time,

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:08.220
do you see this sort of melding
of public and public figure

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:12.390
opinions about media
that people produce,

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:16.160
as kind of being the
way forward for just

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:21.200
kind of a discussion on media
that's out in the public?

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:24.262
And you can give the
opinions of others

00:44:24.262 --> 00:44:25.720
that you've heard,
your own opinion

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:28.610
or if time has it
in the contract

00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:30.640
that you can't say
too much about this,

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:33.510
then give that as well.

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:35.974
What are your thoughts?

00:44:35.974 --> 00:44:37.640
LEV GROSSMAN: It's
an interesting issue,

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.090
which I think this is
really under-discussed.

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:44.051
I mean, the climate in which
books are read and written,

00:44:44.051 --> 00:44:45.800
just the sort of
informational environment

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.640
in which this happens
has completely

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:53.860
transformed in the past
10 years, 15 years,

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:55.470
and in a very strange way.

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:57.360
I mean, barriers and
boundaries that we

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:04.840
think of as firm and solid
are completely porous.

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:06.720
It's actually an
anecdote worth telling

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:10.390
that my mom met CS Lewis and
had a little chat with him.

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:12.830
Now, when people finish, "The
Magicians," the first thing

00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:13.950
they do is Google me.

00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:16.030
They see that I'm on
Twitter and tweet at me

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:18.180
and we have a little exchange.

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:20.450
So the quantity of
information that's

00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:24.680
flying back and forth between
reader and writer is enormous.

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:28.200
And in effects the way
that books are written

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:33.154
and I think experienced in ways
that are hard to understand.

00:45:33.154 --> 00:45:34.820
I mean, in some ways
I think it's great.

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:39.140
One of the reasons I'm
on Twitter and Goodreads

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:46.030
is just because I don't really
like this sense that it's

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:48.110
easy to get, that
authors are austere

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:55.214
or sort of mystical
beings, even godlike.

00:45:55.214 --> 00:45:58.740
You know, they're
just normal people

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:01.470
who are trying to words
together like anybody else.

00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:03.220
And I like that sort
of de-mystification

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:06.590
that is accomplished
by social media.

00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:07.640
But it's a strange thing.

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:08.910
And as a writer,
you definitely have

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:10.451
to watch it because,
you know, you're

00:46:10.451 --> 00:46:15.860
really getting a ton of
feedback in near real-time

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:18.380
as to how people are
reacting to your work.

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:20.052
And, you know,
there's a temptation

00:46:20.052 --> 00:46:21.760
to kind of bob and
weave and sort of feed

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.176
that back into
what you're writing

00:46:23.176 --> 00:46:25.154
and think, oh, you know
that guy tweeted me.

00:46:25.154 --> 00:46:26.570
He's going to love
this, you know.

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:29.390
And I better not do that
because this other person

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:31.660
didn't like it.

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:34.800
You know, you'll rapidly
go insane and also write

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.720
really bad novels,
if you're just

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:40.010
trying to guess what
people want all the time.

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:41.970
It's a strange thing,
and I am absolutely

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:47.780
sure that it's changing
literature in significant ways.

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:49.340
I don't quite know
how yet, but I

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.450
think later we're going
to go back and notice

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:57.390
that this was an inflection
point and very weird one.

00:46:57.390 --> 00:47:00.550
AUDIENCE: So this is probably
a slightly rude question.

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:02.740
But sparked from a
couple of answers

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:06.010
ago, what thoughts are
you willing to share about

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:06.820
where next?

00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:11.700
As you say, you've sort of
salted the earth and moved on.

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:14.634
What are you willing to
say about what's next?

00:47:14.634 --> 00:47:16.050
LEV GROSSMAN: Well,
what I'm doing

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:19.614
next-- I'll tell
you what I'm not

00:47:19.614 --> 00:47:22.030
doing next, which is this book
that I just spent a year on

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:25.510
and then didn't work out.

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:28.640
I'm still sulking
from that experience.

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:30.490
It's a strange thing.

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:33.510
I've actually
written five novels,

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:37.740
and yet it's still possible
for me to get completely lost,

00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:41.760
go down a rabbit hole, throw
away tens and tens of thousands

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:46.140
of words on something
that's just not working out.

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:49.050
I now feel like I've found
the trail again with something

00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:51.145
else.

00:47:51.145 --> 00:47:51.855
It is fantasy.

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:57.720
I think it's going to
feel very different from,

00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:58.450
"The Magicians."

00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:01.405
I've been reading a
lot of Thomas Malory.

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:06.860
He's one of the many
hundreds of people

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:12.076
who wrote a version
of the Arthurian epic.

00:48:12.076 --> 00:48:13.367
I've been reading a lot of him.

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.390
That's probably
all I should say.

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:22.890
But that's where my
research is going right now.

00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:25.660
I think that's probably
it for the hour.

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:27.030
Thank you all for coming.

00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:28.880
And for those who
didn't come anyway, just

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.670
are watching at your
desks, thank you too.

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:31.170
Thank you.

00:48:31.170 --> 00:48:32.720
