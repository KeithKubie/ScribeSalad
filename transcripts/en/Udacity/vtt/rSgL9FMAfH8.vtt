00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.520
&gt;&gt; Let's just do a little quiz. So, here is our

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.120
concept class and our hypothesis class, which are the same in this

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.330
case, which is the set of functions H sub I, that return,

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.800
for an input X, it returns the Ith bit of that input.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.767
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:15.972
&gt;&gt; All right. So if we're talking about

00:00:15.972 --> 00:00:20.010
K bit inputs then there's going to be a

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.432
hypothesis in this set for each of those

00:00:22.432 --> 00:00:26.210
K bits, and that hypothesis returns the corresponding bit.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.150
And so, we're given a training set with examples like that.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.549
And then we need to produce outputs that are consistent with

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.349
that. And so what I'd like you to try to figure

00:00:35.349 --> 00:00:38.047
out is, tell me, do you think that there is an

00:00:38.047 --> 00:00:41.100
algorithm L, such that C is PAC learnable by L using

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.466
H? So if you can give me a learning algorithm that

00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.816
would do a good job, and would, with high probability, be

00:00:45.816 --> 00:00:47.940
able to figure this out, then you should go for it.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.730
&gt;&gt; Okay.
