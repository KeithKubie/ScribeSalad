00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.203
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.203 --> 00:00:17.600
You know, with the advent of
the commercial space revolution,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.540
with the fact that
human beings are finally

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.560
going to domesticate
space travel,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.530
it's worth celebrating
for once why

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.040
we want to explore the
heavens to begin with.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.830
And Marina Benjamin
perhaps has the best line.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.710
She says, "When
we dream of space,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.760
we dream of transcendence.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.542
We dream of what
we might become."

00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:43.270
The exploratory
journey, that desire

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.900
to break through
boundaries, to probe

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.730
the perimeters of
possibility, to explore

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.726
the adjacent possible-- that
is what it means to be human.

00:00:54.726 --> 00:00:57.410
"We didn't stay in the
caves," says Kurzweil.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.298
"We didn't stay on the planet."

00:00:59.298 --> 00:01:01.310
With biotechnology,
we won't stay

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.540
with the limitations of biology.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.970
In fact, today, by leveraging
exponentially emerging

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.810
technologies, we're going
to have computers trillions

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.280
of times more powerful
navigating spaceships

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.650
that are millions of times
cheaper taking us to space.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.600
Richard Branson's
Virgin Galactic

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.690
is going to take
artists into space.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.640
What's going to happen when
poets and artists look down

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.410
upon the Earth?

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.790
What new reflections that
will uplift the human spirit,

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.550
that will thrust
human consciousness

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.180
towards the numinous,
might transpire

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.646
when we keep pushing
beyond all limits, when

00:01:34.646 --> 00:01:37.130
we get to Kubrick's
beyond the infinite,

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.010
the place where dreams are
born, through the wormhole,

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.475
down the rabbit hole.

00:01:43.475 --> 00:01:44.280
It's glorious.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.390
It's what Neil
deGrasse Tyson says.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.980
"Doing what's never been
done before is intellectually

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.900
seductive, whether or not
we deem it practical."

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.960
It's what we do.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.700
It's what makes us cosmic
heroes, cosmic revolutionaries,

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.810
not stooges
conscripted to advance

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.460
a natural order
that kills everyone.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.080
So let us go forth.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:03:13.700
