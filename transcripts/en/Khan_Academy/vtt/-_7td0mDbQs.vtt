00:00:00.291 --> 00:00:01.572
- [Voiceover] Let's see if
we can take the derivative

00:00:01.572 --> 00:00:03.638
with respect to x of the fourth root

00:00:03.638 --> 00:00:07.759
of x to the third power plus
four x squared plus seven.

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:09.209
And at first you might say, "All right,

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:11.252
"how do I take the
derivative of the fourth root

00:00:11.252 --> 00:00:13.703
"of something, it looks like
I have a composite function,

00:00:13.703 --> 00:00:17.423
"I'm taking the fourth root
of another expression?"

00:00:17.423 --> 00:00:18.256
And you'd be right.

00:00:18.256 --> 00:00:19.711
And if you're dealing
with a composite function,

00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:22.592
the chain rule should be front of mind.

00:00:22.592 --> 00:00:24.666
But first, let's just
make this fourth root

00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:27.288
a little bit more tractable for us.

00:00:27.288 --> 00:00:29.264
And just realize that this fourth root

00:00:29.264 --> 00:00:31.274
is nothing but a fractional exponent.

00:00:31.274 --> 00:00:33.531
So this is the same
thing as the derivative

00:00:33.531 --> 00:00:37.698
with respect to x of x to
the third plus four x squared

00:00:40.164 --> 00:00:44.029
plus seven to the 1/4 power,

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:46.362
to the 1/4 power.

00:00:47.483 --> 00:00:51.079
Now, how do we take
the derivative of this?

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.501
Well, we can view this, as
I said a few seconds ago,

00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:56.407
we can view this as a composite function.

00:00:56.407 --> 00:00:57.497
What do we do first with our x?

00:00:57.497 --> 00:00:58.995
Well, we do all of this business,

00:00:58.995 --> 00:01:01.218
and we can call this u of x.

00:01:01.218 --> 00:01:02.978
And then whatever we get for u of x,

00:01:02.978 --> 00:01:05.061
we raise that to the fourth power.

00:01:05.061 --> 00:01:06.749
So the way that we would
take the derivative,

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:08.398
we would take the derivative of this,

00:01:08.398 --> 00:01:10.146
you could view it as the outer function

00:01:10.146 --> 00:01:12.111
with respect to u of x
and then multiply that

00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:15.778
times the derivative
of u with respect to x.

00:01:17.172 --> 00:01:18.589
So let's do that.

00:01:19.677 --> 00:01:21.503
So what this is going to be,

00:01:21.503 --> 00:01:23.988
this is going to be equal to,

00:01:23.988 --> 00:01:27.583
so we're gonna take our outside function,

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:29.893
which I'm highlighting in green now,

00:01:29.893 --> 00:01:32.267
so, or I take something to the 1/4,

00:01:32.267 --> 00:01:34.000
I'm gonna take the derivative
of that with respect

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.841
to the inside, with respect to u of x.

00:01:36.841 --> 00:01:38.218
Well, I'm just gonna
use the power rule here.

00:01:38.218 --> 00:01:40.626
I'm just gonna bring that 1/4 out front,

00:01:40.626 --> 00:01:43.506
so it's gonna be 1/4 times

00:01:43.506 --> 00:01:46.006
whatever I'm taking the
derivative with respect to,

00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:49.891
to the 1/4 minus one power.

00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:52.147
Look, all I did was use
the power rule here.

00:01:52.147 --> 00:01:53.774
I didn't have an x here.

00:01:53.774 --> 00:01:56.105
Now I'm taking the derivative
with respect to u of x,

00:01:56.105 --> 00:01:59.338
with respect to this
polynomial expression here.

00:01:59.338 --> 00:02:03.261
So I could just throw the
u of x in here if I like,

00:02:03.261 --> 00:02:04.234
actually let me just do that.

00:02:04.234 --> 00:02:06.909
So, this is going to be x to the third

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.278
plus four x squared plus seven.

00:02:10.278 --> 00:02:12.061
And then I wanna multiply that,

00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:12.986
and this is the chain rule.

00:02:12.986 --> 00:02:14.601
I took the derivative of the outside

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:17.461
with respect to the inside and
then I'm gonna multiply that

00:02:17.461 --> 00:02:19.979
times the derivative of the inside.

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:22.139
So what's the derivative of u of x?

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.549
U prime of x, let's see we just gonna use

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:26.860
the power rule a bunch of times,

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.242
it's gonna be three x squared

00:02:30.242 --> 00:02:32.742
plus two times four is eight x

00:02:34.452 --> 00:02:37.703
to the two minus one is
just one power, first power,

00:02:37.703 --> 00:02:40.079
so I can just write that as eight x,

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.988
and then the derivative
with respect to x of seven,

00:02:41.988 --> 00:02:44.487
well, the derivative with
respect to x of a constant

00:02:44.487 --> 00:02:45.688
is just gonna be zero.

00:02:45.688 --> 00:02:46.808
So that's u prime of x.

00:02:46.808 --> 00:02:49.016
So then I'm just gonna
multiply by u prime of x

00:02:49.016 --> 00:02:51.766
which is three x squared plus,

00:02:52.628 --> 00:02:55.354
three x squared plus eight x.

00:02:55.354 --> 00:02:59.374
And so, well, I can clean
this up a little bit,

00:02:59.374 --> 00:03:01.541
so this would be equal to,

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.249
this would be equal to.

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:07.749
Actually let me just
rewrite that exponent there.

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:11.284
So this 1/4 minus one, I can rewrite it,

00:03:11.284 --> 00:03:14.941
1/4 minus one is negative 3/4,

00:03:14.941 --> 00:03:16.941
negative 3/4,

00:03:17.963 --> 00:03:20.463
negative 3/4 power.

00:03:21.548 --> 00:03:24.288
And you can manipulate this in
different ways, if you like,

00:03:24.288 --> 00:03:26.298
but the key is to just
recognize that this is

00:03:26.298 --> 00:03:28.086
an application of the chain rule.

00:03:28.086 --> 00:03:29.932
Derivative of the outside, well, actually,

00:03:29.932 --> 00:03:31.565
the first thing to
realize is the fourth root

00:03:31.565 --> 00:03:34.087
is the same thing as taking
something to the 1/4 power,

00:03:34.087 --> 00:03:36.830
basic exponent property, and then realize,

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.602
okay, I have a composite function here.

00:03:38.602 --> 00:03:40.145
So I can take the
derivative of the outside

00:03:40.145 --> 00:03:42.391
with respect to the inside,
that's what we did here,

00:03:42.391 --> 00:03:46.949
times the derivative of the
inside with respect to x.

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:49.372
And so if someone were to tell you,

00:03:49.372 --> 00:03:53.156
if someone were to say,
"All right, f of x,

00:03:53.156 --> 00:03:56.573
"f of x is equal to the fourth root of

00:03:58.261 --> 00:04:02.701
"x to the third plus four
x squared plus seven,"

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:05.691
and then they said,
"Well, what is f prime of

00:04:05.691 --> 00:04:08.372
"I don't know, negative three?"

00:04:08.372 --> 00:04:11.280
Well, you would evaluate
this at negative three.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.450
So let me just do that.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.298
So it's 1/4 times,

00:04:15.298 --> 00:04:17.619
see, you have negative 27,

00:04:17.619 --> 00:04:19.579
I hope this works out reasonably well,

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:20.996
plus 36, plus 36,

00:04:23.895 --> 00:04:27.062
plus 7 to the negative 3/4,

00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:29.554
what does this result to?

00:04:29.554 --> 00:04:32.371
This is going to be equal to,

00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:35.054
this right over here is 16, right?

00:04:35.054 --> 00:04:37.586
Negative 27 plus seven is negative 20

00:04:37.586 --> 00:04:39.503
plus 36, so this is 16.

00:04:40.456 --> 00:04:42.254
I think this is going to work out nicely.

00:04:42.254 --> 00:04:43.421
And then times

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:48.718
three times negative, so three times nine,

00:04:48.718 --> 00:04:50.468
which is 27 minus 24.

00:04:53.088 --> 00:04:55.714
So this is going to be right over here,

00:04:55.714 --> 00:04:57.404
that is going to be three.

00:04:57.404 --> 00:04:59.991
Now, what is 16 to the negative 3/4?

00:04:59.991 --> 00:05:04.861
So this is 1/4 times,
so 16 times to the 1/4

00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:08.252
is two and then you raise that to the,

00:05:08.252 --> 00:05:11.004
let me, actually I don't
want to skip steps here.

00:05:11.004 --> 00:05:13.184
At this point we're dealing with algebra,

00:05:13.184 --> 00:05:14.731
or maybe even pre-algebra.

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:17.731
So this is going to be times, times,

00:05:19.106 --> 00:05:21.189
16 to the 1/4,

00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:24.418
and then we're gonna raise
that to the negative three

00:05:24.418 --> 00:05:26.571
times that three out front.

00:05:26.571 --> 00:05:28.167
So we could put that three there.

00:05:28.167 --> 00:05:30.747
16 to the 1/4 is two,

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:32.384
two to the third is eight,

00:05:32.384 --> 00:05:36.009
so two to the negative third power is 1/8,

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:37.568
so that is 1/8.

00:05:37.568 --> 00:05:40.032
So we have 3/4 times 1/8

00:05:40.032 --> 00:05:44.115
which is equal to three over 32, 3/32.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.540
So that would be the
slope of the tangent line

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.103
of the graph y is equal to f of x

00:05:51.103 --> 00:05:53.868
when x is equal to negative three.
