1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.610
The Joe Rogan experience.
So we're going to be in Chicago for that big fight.

2
00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:08.700
Fuck it.
Oh,
how would I was going to be fine.

3
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.440
What does that June mm,
what does that,
what does that,
June 8th,
right?
June 8th.

4
00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:16.050
Right now I don't,
I don't think there's any tickets left.

5
00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:19.050
If anybody wants to know.
I doubt it pretty close.
But there's a,

6
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:22.900
that's a big UFC car too,
isn't it?
Who's on that car?
Uh,

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.410
I just saw this morning,
I just looked this morning.

8
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.990
Henry pseudo versus a Marlin Mariah's for the bantamweight title.
Ooh.

9
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.750
She has the opportunity to become champ champ.

10
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.810
And then I'm Ma Marlin rise.
Fucking fantastic fighter.
Yeah,

11
00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:43.460
that's a great card.
She me Rivera and Petra Yawn.
Yawn.

12
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.660
Pyotr I think you're suppose to say peel truck to pure tra.

13
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.940
Pure tro Russian character.
Valentino of changeovers.
Jessica.
I,

14
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:58.560
that's great fight too.
That's such a great name.
Stuff.
Chanko yeah.

15
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.070
Such a great fucking Badass.
I fuck you up.
Name that.
Hold on.

16
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.270
Stop scrolling back up.
It's Tatiana Suarez is a beast to,

17
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.010
that woman is so good.
She's probably the best wrestler in female MMA.

18
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.630
She smashes people and Nita and Sar off is fantastic.

19
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.620
That's a great fight.
That's um,
Amanda Nunez.
His girlfriend too.

20
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.450
Amanda Nunez is probably the baddest woman,
literally ever.

21
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.120
And we met her,
right?
Yeah,
she was at the last,

22
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.450
she's the one who knocked out Cyborg.

23
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.580
Cyborg was the baddest woman in MMA when Amanda knew at Nunez starched her in

24
00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:33.414
the first round.

25
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.780
There's no one you could literally legitimately give that title too.

26
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.000
It's Amanda Nunez.
She is the baddest woman ever.

27
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.320
Aljamain sterling versus page on windows.
That's a gray card.

28
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.690
Ricardo Lamas.
Calvin,
Kate,
or that's a great fight to shit.
A lot of,

29
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.320
a lot of chicks,
a lot of checks be fighting.
A lot of Chicago girls saying,
go,

30
00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:56.700
go girls getting ready,
getting ready to fly.
Tam fucking tie in this town.

31
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.160
That's you guys.
That's Boston.
Chicago girls are more,

32
00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:01.600
I don't know how to say the Chicago and Chicago's,
she

33
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.630
can kiss my ass.
I'll fuck you up.
