00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
To answer this question, all we need to do is press on run

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and you'll see that now we only require four tests.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You see how delta debugging splits the list, quickly finds a sub-list that is just two elements,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
checks each of them and finds the one element that causes the test to fail.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The correct answer here was 4.
