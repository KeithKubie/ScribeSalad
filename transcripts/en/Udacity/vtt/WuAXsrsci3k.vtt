00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.960
No matter which method you
use to find your classes

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.980
you'll end up on a screen like this.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.591
Let's talk a little bit about
what this information on

00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:09.370
this screen actually means.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.800
Under the Select column you'll see
a check mark if you can register for

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.660
that class or a letter if you can't.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.070
If you can't,
it might be because the class is full or

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.210
might be because your
registration window isn't open.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.440
Next is the CRN column.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.210
We'll talk about this in a bit.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.600
The next nine columns are just
information about the class.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.290
This won't generally change
from class to class, so

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.540
don't worry too much about this.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.420
The next three columns stands for
capacity, active and remaining.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.640
Capacity is how many
people can take the class.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.350
Active is how many students
are currently in the class.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.790
And remaining is
the number of slots left.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.650
When a class fills up then students
start joining the waitlist,

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.540
which also has capacity,
active, and remaining columns.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.730
So now let's talk about
actually adding a class.
