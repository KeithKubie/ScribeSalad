00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.000
Say we now add a transparent green object to our scene. To avoid our original

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.800
rendering problem, the rule is that all opaque objects are drawn first. So the

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.660
blue object is rendered. If we now render the green object, and then, the red

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.385
object in that order. The green object will block the red one. We want the blue

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:25.045
object to be affected by both the green and red filters. But the red filter is

00:00:25.045 --> 00:00:30.170
rendered too late and has no effect. Just to make life exciting, say we add yet

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.760
another filter, a yellow one behind the blue object. This filter is not visible

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.032
for the pixel shown. But whatever solution we choose must make sure this object

00:00:39.032 --> 00:00:43.500
is taken into account properly. My question to you is, which is the best

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.561
solution? The one that will give us the result of red blend to blue. And then

00:00:47.561 --> 00:00:51.945
green blended over that. Draw all the transparent objects, sorted by their alpha

00:00:51.945 --> 00:00:56.844
values, largest to smallest. Using the painter's algorithm, with the z-buffer

00:00:56.844 --> 00:01:01.928
off. Sorted in back to front order. Or based on intensity, with the brightest

00:01:01.928 --> 00:01:03.371
objects drawn first.
