00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.200
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: I'm Mark
Dimunation, and I'm Chief

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.500
of the Rare Book Division.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.960
And we're very happy to have
here today the young Russell

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.290
Maret [laughter], an
appellation that he earned many,

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.230
many years ago back

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.920
in the Eisenhower
administration when I -- No.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.480
Russell, but I have known
Russell for a very long time.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.910
And when he came in,
he was a young printer

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.100
and had been just starting up.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.690
Much of I have, I think
his oldest production now,

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.000
which is '96, 1996,
I think, right?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.300
&gt;&gt; Ninety-four.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.240
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: Ninety-four.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.320
I think I do.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.340
And has been producing
consistently since then.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.120
What has happened with
Russell is that he's emerged

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.690
from being a kind of
spunky, at the edge,

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.160
always pushing himself sort of
printer to emerge to become one

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.210
of the greatest, certainly one
of the most innovative and --

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.740
What was the third one you
wanted me to say [laughter]?

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.760
Genre-breaking.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.370
John, you knew you were going
to pay for that, didn't you?

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.480
Genre-breaking printers
of his generation.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.950
I actually sincerely mean that.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.760
And anyone who knows his work,
especially the flow of his work

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.190
over time, would agree.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.520
He's a great friend
to this institution.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.010
We are the home of much
of his archival material,

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.230
which means people in Washington
have the opportunity not only

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.130
to look at his book, but
also understand the process

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.990
of this innovative, grand,
genre-breaking printer,

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.250
and understand the meaning
behind many of his books.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.420
Today, for a change,
he's going back in time.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.180
And if there's anything
that Russell can do,

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.500
it's he can tell a story.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.400
And there are many,
many of story

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.220
from Russell's publications
because one

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.240
of the things he does typically

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.810
in publication is try something
that's utterly impossible.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.690
And those of us who've
been on the phone with him

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.540
when he's printing where
you say, you're running it

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.120
through 17 times, all
blue, I don't understand,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.520
you'll get a notion of
that from Russell's talk.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.440
So we're really thrilled to
have my good friend Russell

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.740
here today.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.540
So please welcome him.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.810
[ Applause ]

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.510
&gt;&gt; Russell Maret: Thank you.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.290
Yeah. Yeah, I had this nice,

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.800
smooth entrance planned,
but you messed it up.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.980
Anyway, you know, DC has a real
warm place in my heart my, well,

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.610
this is going to sound weird,

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.230
but because the two largest
collections of my work are here.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.890
That's not why it
has the warm spot.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.930
It's because those collections
were built by two people,

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.730
Al Mears and Mark Dimunation,
who have become very dear

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.050
and close friends of mine.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.030
And the reason that we're here
today is because Al Mears,

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.270
who is the only person who
has a complete collection

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:31.220
of my published work, has
decided to sell his copy

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.150
of the first book I published,
"Meditation on Saviors,"

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.930
to the library, which
is the only book

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.700
of mine they do not have.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.460
And for any collector
in the room,

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.340
you'll understand how
momentous a gesture that is

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.590
for a collector to
relinquish their top position.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.510
And so, I just want to thank Al.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.930
So I'm sure it's bittersweet.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.900
It is for both of us.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.190
But in thinking about when
I say he's the only person

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.180
who has a complete collection,
what I mean by that is,

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.870
I've never owned a copy of
"Meditation on Saviors."

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:19.460
And the process of making
it was so excruciating,

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.180
both psychologically
and technically,

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.470
that I've tried ever
since to forget it.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:35.090
But in thinking about this
gesture of the book moving here,

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.590
I realize that the things
that made it so difficult,

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.770
technically at least, rather
than me having learned from them

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.450
and stopped using that
as a working method,

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.630
the process by which I came
to the design and making

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.120
of "Meditation on Saviors"
is the process that I employ

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.510
in almost all the
work I've made since,

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.610
which is why I get
those weird phone calls.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.440
You're doing what?

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.880
So anyway, so I decided that
it would be fun to look back

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.550
at some projects through
that lens of the sort

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.510
of completely impractical
decision that ends

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.660
up bringing me into new
ground or whatever in my work.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.640
And so, the story starts
when I looked like this.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.170
And when I was 18 years old,
I got on a train in New York

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.080
for San Francisco to study
poetry at the New College

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.200
of California, now defunct.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.340
And shortly after arriving,
I walked into a print shop

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.430
that was in the basement and
had my first profound experience

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.730
of love at first sight.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.640
And it was literally the only
thing I'd ever wanted to do,

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.890
and I've done it for
the 30 years since then.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:55.180
And shortly after that
experience, I met Peter Koch,

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.760
great printer in the Bay
Area, who was teaching

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.410
at New College for
that one year.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.210
And I started apprenticing
in his studio.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.950
And at the time, he also got
me a gig living and working

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.350
at the Press in Tuscany Alley,

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.450
which was a storied
California private press.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.490
And between the two of those,
I really had this feeling

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.740
that I was being sort of
inculcated into the tradition

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.500
of the California private press.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.600
And for that movement,
there's no greater barterer

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.420
than Robinson Jeffers,
that he is seen here

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.280
in the iconic photograph
by Edward Weston, you know,

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.210
with open collar,
in front of rock.

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.910
You know, he's a man.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.210
He's a man.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.310
And for those of you who don't
know Robinson Jeffers, you know,

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.600
he and his wife,
Una, moved to Carmel

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.440
when it was a very
different place.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.140
Clint Eastwood didn't
live there.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.440
And he built them a house
out of granite and cypress

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.200
from the Carmel headlands
called Tor House and Hawk Tower.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.410
And this all became part of his
sort of myth as this rugged,

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.980
misanthropic poet who like
sat in his tower and looked

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.210
at the sea with his
back to humanity.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.680
And he wrote a lot of things.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.260
My favorite line from "Hurt
Hawks" is, "I'd sooner,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.230
except the penalties,
kill a man than a hawk."

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.970
You know, he wrote
things like that.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:29.500
And the editions of his
work that are published

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:35.070
by private press printers tend
to sort of emphasize that aspect

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.790
of him, that sort
of manly quality.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.730
This is Peter Koch's
"Point Lobos."

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.660
The slide doesn't give
a sense of its scale,

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.870
but two people could eat dinner
comfortably off of this book.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.450
It's huge and massive.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:54.710
And it clearly references
the most famous edition

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.960
of Robinson Jeffers' poetry,
William Everson's "Granite

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.710
and Cypress," which is a
remarkable typographic work

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:07.390
that's housed in, I think
now looking back on it as,

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.230
a kind of gimmicky
cypress and granite box.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:14.630
The book itself, the printed
book is really remarkable.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:20.690
But this is how the private
press movement had traditionally

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:23.510
interpreted Robinson
Jeffers' work.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.650
And however much I might have
thought of myself, like to think

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:31.400
of myself as being like Robinson
Jeffers, I'm really not.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.640
And I just chose this
picture for two reasons: one,

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.810
it's me with my collar
open in front of rock.

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:41.080
The other is that, you
can't see it very well,

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.050
but I'm wearing a striped,
short-sleeve shirt,

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:47.790
which is the shirt that I
wore the first time I came

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:50.430
to meet Mark Dimunation here.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:54.410
&gt;&gt; Probably your only shirt.

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:56.380
&gt;&gt; Russell Maret: Probably
my only shirt, yeah, yeah.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.780
I spent it all on paper.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.100
But anyway, so I
finished my apprenticeship

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:05.080
or ended my apprenticeship in
California and went on to work

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.880
at Firefly Press in Boston for
a bit and then found my way back

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.220
to New York to start a press.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.730
And I knew I wanted
to make books,

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:18.230
but it was really hard
figuring out what book to make.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:21.210
And in the process, I sort
of met this illustrator,

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:24.060
Murray Tinkelman, who somehow
convinced me to do a book

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.410
about the Brooklyn Dodgers.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:29.950
And, at some point,
I became keenly aware

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:33.500
that I didn't want my first
book to be about a subject

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.710
for which I didn't
care, which is baseball.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:41.050
And so, I started talking with
this artist, Paul Maloney,

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.480
in California, and we
came up with the idea

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.950
of maybe doing a Jeffers'
book with some poems

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.260
and his illustrations.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.150
And at the time, I thought it
would be very much in that vein

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.520
of the California, you
know, the big, chunky book.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:10:00.690
But in the meantime, I wrote a
poem for a girlfriend of mine

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.750
at the time and decided
to print it as a book.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.480
And she had lived in Japan.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.220
And so, I came up with this idea
of making a book that would be

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.550
like a Japanese screen,

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.040
where I'd make these
little wood screens,

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.330
stretch the printed
pages over the front,

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.640
and then put a decorative
paper on the back.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.620
And it would collapse and
open up and everything.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:22.920
So I set to work.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.220
I printed the poem.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.790
I built my little balsa wood
screens and stretched the thing

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:33.140
and then put the
decorative paper on the back.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:37.140
And the minute I finished
putting the decorative paper

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.990
on the back, I realized that
it couldn't close [laughter],

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:46.100
emblematic of our
relationship [laughter].

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:55.240
Now one might think that
having made this structure

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.080
that didn't work that
you wouldn't choose it

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.430
as the structure for your first
book to make an edition of.

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:04.420
But you would be wrong.

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.280
And so, anyway, I came up
with this idea that I wanted

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.460
to make a book of Robinson
because although he has all

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:16.340
of this really gritty writing,
like, you know, boulders blunted

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:19.850
like bears' teeth, you know,
this thick masculine rating,

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:24.370
he also is extremely effusive
about sunsets and rainbows.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:27.780
And his poetry is
populated by sort

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:31.090
of hard frontier
characters, but it's full

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:34.860
of remarkably sensitive
observations of nature

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.040
and people and motives and love.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.070
And so, what I wanted to do
is I wanted to make a book

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.030
that was the exact opposite

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:45.660
of what one expected
of Robinson Jeffers.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.950
And here it is.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:52.100
So instead of a heavy
book, this is --

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.600
This can't weigh eight ounces.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.730
I mean, it's just
incredibly light.

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.260
And so, there I was.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.120
Okay. I'm going to
make this book.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.820
And so, I get my
little font of type,

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:06.050
and I buy the kitakata
paper, and I print it.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:08.820
And all the sudden,
I'm completely overcome

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.770
by crippling self-doubt.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:14.590
And the sheets of paper sit
in my living room for months,

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:16.610
like, you know, albatross.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.200
So like every time I looked at
them, they're like you failed,

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.080
you're not going to do it,
you're not going to do it.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.120
And anyway, I finally got the
will to start making this.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.610
And I go down to the
Center for Book Arts

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:30.110
and cut my little
pieces of balsa wood.

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:34.860
And the first four or five
copies, either the second

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:41.230
or third of the sixth panels was
either the wrong page or upside

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.780
down or completely misaligned.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:48.160
I ruined -- It was if my doubt
just chose to sabotage me.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.460
It was miserable.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:53.780
I had this little coffee
table in front of my sofa

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.950
where I did all the
cutting and everything.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:13:02.880
And my girlfriend's parents were
like, who the hell is this guy.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:07.100
But anyway, I finally
finished one,

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.670
and I had no idea
what to do with it.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.630
So I called the book dealer
Burton Weiss in California,

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:13.030
who was the only
book dealer I knew.

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.510
And I said, look,
I made this book.

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.450
Let me send one to you,
see what you can do,

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:20.980
and I need help deciding
what to price it.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:24.900
And I thought maybe
$1500 or something.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.470
And I sent it out to him, and he
calls me up and he's like, 475.

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:29.770
Like, well, okay.

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:33.410
And then he goes, and I
want the whole edition.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:37.260
And I never forget this
feeling of hanging up the phone

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.610
and just thinking,
I'm going to be rich.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:43.910
And, you know, all I've heard
about is Peter Koch complaining

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:49.740
about how hard it
is to sell books.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.040
It's easy.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.640
Well, the easy part of it
meant that over nine months,

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:59.480
I managed to make 14
copies that I got,

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.540
13 of them, I got $285 for.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:07.220
You know, the paper on the
back cost $30 per copy.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.840
There were two times when
I went into New York City,

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.400
bought the paper, and left it
on the train after I got off.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.510
Like, I just -- Anyway, so.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:20.640
[ Laughter ]

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:26.860
But what's amazing is that
this horrible process resulted

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.160
in two great things.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.770
I published a book, which
got rid of an enormous amount

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:35.350
of fear of putting
myself out there.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:40.500
And shortly after
selling a couple of copies

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.220
to Burton Weiss, I got a letter
from a man named Al Mears,

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.060
telling me how wonderful
he thought the book was,

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:52.370
and it was just this
transformative moment for me.

00:14:52.370 --> 00:15:00.520
But so, it's also
this idea that the --

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.110
You know, printing is
such a practical art,

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:07.570
but here was an example of
making a decision about my work

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:11.970
that was so impractical,
but it led to this sort

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.300
of wonderful thing ultimately.

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.050
And I've just realized
that that's sort

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.060
of what I've continued to doing.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.480
And so, I'm just
going to talk about --

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.390
I've got most of the books out
that I'm going to talk about.

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:27.350
A couple of years after making
"Meditation on Saviors,"

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:30.600
I was looking at this
woodcut by Francesco Clemente.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.480
And I thought, God, it
looks like a watercolor.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.160
And at the time, I was
living with a couple of guys,

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.090
one of whom was a theater
designer and he had a book

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.670
on the Commedia dell'arte,
about which I knew nothing.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:45.360
But I started reading about
it, and I was fascinated

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.760
by this idea that the
characters were sort

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:52.130
of lived beyond the people
who actually played them.

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:56.310
They were stock characters who
were recognizable by their sort

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:59.910
of stock outfits and the
colors that they wore.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:03.110
And I thought, wow, this would
be really fun to get a bunch

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:06.570
of magnesium cuts of
appropriated imagery

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:09.290
of these characters from
the Commedia dell'arte,

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:14.710
assign each a color, ink them in
watercolor paint, and print them

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:18.160
with paper that had standing
water on them and make it bleed

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.460
and be all this romantic,

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:24.710
sort of Commedia
dell'arte bleeding stuff.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:28.060
And so, I ran out, and
I got one magnesium dye

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.660
and a tube of paint.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.970
And I went to the Center for
Book Arts, and I rolled one up

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.730
and took a sheet of paper out of
a bath of water and carried it

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:38.370
over to a steel press, with
water just going everywhere,

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:41.550
and ran it through, and it
worked, and it was fantastic.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.040
And so, I bought all this
paper; I bought all these cuts,

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.400
bought my watercolor paint.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.750
And it turned out
that one print worked,

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:54.120
but it was a very,
very hot summer.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.750
And the Center for Book Arts at
the time was 5000 square feet

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.740
with one little air-conditioner
window unit.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:07.210
And it was so that I would roll
the watercolor onto the plate,

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:10.820
and by the time I got the
paper out of the bath and over,

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.530
it would have just dried enough.

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:14.990
And the water was so
wet that I'd print it,

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:16.990
and rather than the paint
going onto the paper,

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:20.360
the paper would stay
on the plate.

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.820
And so, I realized that what
I had to do was print it

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:27.640
in the middle of the night, when
it would be as cool as possible.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.480
And so, I would get to the
center at one in the morning,

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.360
and I would get all the --
And some of these, you know,

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.660
because it was watercolor,

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:39.640
you had to print all the
colors in the same go.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:44.570
And some of the pages, I
think the most is four colors

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.180
or five colors or
three or something.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.710
And so, imagine you've
got your table,

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:54.090
you roll out the three colors,
you run over to the press, and,

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.550
you know, you're sort of holding
the brayers and going like that,

00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:00.280
and then you get the paper,
run it through, go like that,

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.290
and then you have
to clean everything

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.720
because the paint has dried
on your brayers, on the glass,

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.230
on the plates and everything.

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:11.150
And it was just, you
know, one of those moments

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:14.320
where I did create this
book that was, you know,

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.560
it's got colors in it in a way

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.530
that I've never had
in a book before.

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:22.330
The prints are, you know,
looking back at them,

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:24.610
they're maybe not great.

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:29.990
But it was, again, this
moment of just like,

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:31.410
oh, well, it works once.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:37.050
It's probably going to work
every time, or it doesn't work.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:38.450
Maybe it'll work every time.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:45.450
And a few months after that,
I was looking at this drawing

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:49.370
by Rudolf Koch with Fritz Kredel
when I was suddenly possessed

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:53.550
of the idea for a typeface
for the "Book of Job."

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:57.090
I had never designed
any kind of letter form.

00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:00.950
I can't really draw, and
I'm not a calligrapher.

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:03.920
But I just was absolutely
convinced.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.640
And I spent the night awake
in bed and, the next morning,

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.080
got out of bed and considered
myself a type designer.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:15.020
And I really thought at the
time, this was December 1st,

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:19.140
1996, I really thought at
the time that, in 1997,

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:22.520
I would have a metal
type of my Job typeface

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:26.080
and I would print this
book to worldwide acclaim.

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:30.810
But since I didn't know how to
design type, I figured I have

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:33.660
to start by figuring out
how to draw letterforms.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:37.850
And since I can't draw freehand
but I understand geometry,

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:40.340
I thought, well,
there's this tradition

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.640
of geometric letterforms,
and so I started drawing

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.450
and painting geometric letters.

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:49.090
And then I thought, well,
there's no way I can afford

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:52.090
to make a typeface, so how am I
going to raise the money for it.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:53.800
And I know.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.070
I'll raise the money
by making manuscripts

00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:03.110
of geometric alphabets because
there's a huge market for that,

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:07.400
and I'll make tons of money,
and I'll make my typeface.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:12.700
I don't think I need to tell
you how that turned out.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.760
So I started doing
these manuscripts,

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.120
editioned manuscripts
where I would paint

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.090
and draw every letter of
the alphabet in every copy.

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:26.780
And although it never
led to making --

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.950
I didn't actually
make a typeface

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:31.550
until 2008, so 12 years later.

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:37.040
But what it initiated was it was
a completely crackpot moment.

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.900
I think I had pneumonia
at the time actually.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:46.380
And yeah. And what
it ended up leading

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:51.600
to was this extended
study of letters as form,

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.670
and which seems simple,
but it's actually become --

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:57.360
Mark is holding up the a
from Eclectic Geometric

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.940
or Lunch with Nicolete.

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:04.360
This is the D and F and the P
and X. This is the last and,

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.660
by far, the most complex
geometric alphabet

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:08.960
that I've done.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.480
The Library of Congress also
owns two unique alphabets

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.970
of this kind.

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:20.770
But, you know, so this
completely crackpot idea ended

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:24.150
up, you know, leading
to a study and work

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:30.350
that is the absolute foundation
of my entire career since then.

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:33.340
Every book of mine
deals with letterforms

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.640
in one way or another.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:38.640
And it's gotten to the point
where I can't print my own words

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:42.350
in another person's typeface
without feeling like I'm lying.

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:44.640
So yeah. So that's a chapter.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:50.350
And the other thing it did was
it completely tanked my printing

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.540
career from the time I started.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:57.880
From 1998 until 2007, I didn't
publish any printed books,

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:03.280
except for a couple
of pamphlets.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:10.350
And then just to bring us into
the contemporary era, in 2011,

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:15.470
I started -- So I designed
my first typeface in 2008.

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:18.960
By 2011, I had designed
quite a few typefaces,

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.420
and I have made a lot of books
about discrete letterforms,

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:25.590
alphabet books, and decided
that what I wanted to do was

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:28.270
to make a specimen
of my typefaces.

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:31.800
And while I was at the Codex
Book Fair, I was talking

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.010
to the representative of
the Velke Losiny Paper Mill

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:36.470
in the Czech Republic.

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:40.150
And he told me that for
under three dollars a sheet,

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:43.580
I could get a sheet of
handmade paper this big

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.640
with two custom watermarks
in it.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.470
And I just thought this
is going to be great.

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:53.780
Give me a couple of sheets
that I can, you know,

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:58.140
test because I needed
3000 sheets for the book.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.330
So I run home, and
I have these sheets

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:02.340
of paper, and do some tests.

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.560
And I notice, you know, the
type looks a little blacker

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.210
than usual, but I probably
just over inked it.

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:10.470
Yeah, I'll take the 3000 sheets.

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:18.360
And there they are, the
3000 sheets of paper coated

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:22.770
in such a thick coat
of gelatin sizing

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:25.750
that the reason the
letterforms looked thick is

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:28.190
because it was basically
plastic.

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:30.650
And when I printed
the ink on them,

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:32.730
instead of the ink being
absorbed into the paper,

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:35.440
it just went [splatter noise].

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.550
And so, well, that's easy.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.050
Dampen the paper.

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:41.350
You know, everybody

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:45.080
in California has always
told me you draw one sheet

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.960
through about the
water, put five dry on,

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.250
one sheet through about
the water, five dry on,

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:50.930
leave it wrapped with
a little weight on it.

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:53.050
The next day, it's beautiful.

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:59.280
This is what it looked like
the next day, corrugated tin.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.430
And so, but the problem was,

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:04.420
in order to get the
print quality I wanted,

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.760
I needed to dampen it,
which helps get some

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.590
of the gelatin sizing off of it.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:16.080
But even if I found a way to
dampen it and get it smooth,

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.540
there was another problem,

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.780
that the paper stretched
three-eighths of an inch

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:25.680
across its width when it
was damp, which is enormous.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.250
And just to give you
an idea of what kind

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:30.570
of printing I was planning on
doing, the tolerance of printing

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:33.400
in specimens of diverse
characters, which is the book,

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.030
is one two hundred
eighty-eighths of an inch.

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:40.900
The registration, that's the
registration, a quarter point.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:46.690
So the gray lines in which those
two greens are printed is one

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:49.240
two hundred eighty-eighths
of an inch thick.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:53.210
And just to show you
what the difference is,

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:56.570
this is three-eighths
of an inch,

00:24:56.570 --> 00:25:00.150
and that's two hundred
eighty-eighths [laughter].

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:03.920
So basically, if the paper is
damp, the minute you take it

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.710
out of the humidor,
it starts shrinking

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:09.050
in all kinds of crazy ways.

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:13.710
And basically, unless I was
printing wood type posters,

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:15.450
there was no way
I could use this.

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:18.410
That was an unfair job.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:20.590
One color, big prints.

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:23.560
There was no way I
could use this paper.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:27.300
So what I realized is I
would have to dampen it

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:31.970
and dry before printing
it, which led to a bunch

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:34.190
of experiments of
how to dampen it

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:37.170
and dry it so it dried smooth.

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:41.690
We came up with loft drying,
just hanging it with clips.

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:44.920
The problem is, 3000
sheets of paper

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:48.980
in a 270 square foot studio
with two printing presses,

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:53.840
two people, two tables, a plate
maker, a guillotine cutter.

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.290
So what we had to do was
build lightweight drying racks

00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:01.570
that could be lifted with paper
drying on it and put on tables,

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:04.070
and so twine and basswood.

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:07.210
This is Nancy stringing them up.

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:10.640
And Nancy Loeber and a
variety of other assistants,

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.210
mostly Sarah McDermott,
spent over 500 hours

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:19.190
that summer dampening and drying
paper just so I could print

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:24.390
on it, which was distressing.

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:25.690
This is my studio.

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:28.570
So, you know, so
I'm printing here.

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:29.870
This is my press.

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:31.330
I'm standing there.

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:32.630
There's paper drying.

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:33.930
There's paper drying there.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:35.270
It was crazy.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:37.280
It was just crazy.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:41.500
But the book that resulted,
which is right there

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:49.240
on the table, it is the most
tactilely sensual book I've

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.540
ever made.

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:51.860
That paper, after --

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.820
Oh, I forgot to mention that at
a certain point in the process,

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:57.160
I realized that if I dampened

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:03.940
and dried each sheet
twice, it felt really good.

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.960
So that's what we did.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:11.330
And so, you know, it
was this crazy summer.

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:15.950
I was not very enjoyable
for Annie I don't think.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:17.380
But the --

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:20.150
&gt;&gt; So, if they hadn't
sized the paper,

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:22.340
would it have saved
you some work?

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:23.710
&gt;&gt; Russell Maret: Yes,

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:26.190
but it could have
caused other problems.

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:31.460
But we can deal with
that afterward.

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:33.360
But the other thing
-- So, you know,

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.500
it was completely worth
it, is what I'm saying,

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.050
for the book that ended up.

00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:40.510
I love this book.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:43.710
And it's the only book
I've ever made that feels

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:45.680
like that, which is great.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.820
And then the other
thing that I did

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:52.390
for this book was I finally
made a metal type, you know,

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:56.360
14 years after 2007
when I was supposed

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.050
to have my metal Job typeface.

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:01.950
For this book, we ended up
making two metal typefaces.

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:06.270
And that's now a whole
other thing for me.

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:10.410
So I'm just going to do two
more short little things to show

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:12.670
that this is still going on.

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:16.340
For my book ornamental
digressions,

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:20.470
I design this 14-piece ornament
set that I had cast in metal,

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:22.540
and I wanted to do a
specimen book of it.

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:26.340
It was going to involve a lot
of color printing and a lot

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:28.600
of registration and
all of this stuff.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:33.250
And again, each design
was inspired

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:35.520
by a text, a historical text.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.810
And so, one of the
text is by D.R. Hay,

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:42.360
who was Queen Victoria's
interior decorator,

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.580
and he wrote a book called "The
Laws of Harmonious Colouring,"

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.880
which is such a Victorian title.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:52.980
And in it is this wonderful
illustration, which I wanted

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:55.580
to try to re-create in the book.

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:59.250
And now, when I'm doing
complex color printing,

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:02.100
I always proof all the way

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.280
through to make sure
all the colors work,

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.690
everything works together.

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:12.940
But with this print, I realized
it was going to be 16 colors,

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:14.370
and I just couldn't bear it.

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:15.700
I knew it was going to work.

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:19.340
It was definitely going to work.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:22.360
So I just didn't proof it,
and I just printed the thing

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.700
and ended up with this.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.520
And immediately,
said, well, I can't.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.050
This is so ugly.

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:30.570
It's an upside down shield

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:32.850
with like a radioactive
sign in the middle.

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:40.010
And the reason is, is because
this whole design is predicated

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:41.750
on 60-degree angles,

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:44.870
and my ornaments work
on 45-degree angles.

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:47.670
And so, it just doesn't work.

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:50.880
The text is no perfectly
harmonious arrangement

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:55.000
of colors can be made unless
all the three primary colors be

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.010
present, which I
actually agree with.

00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:01.320
Cezanne was the great
proof of this.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:06.180
Every color of his had
all three colors in it.

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:09.640
So anyway, so I didn't like
this, and so I decide, okay,

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:14.360
I'll design a different print
that only nine press runs.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:17.820
And whereas this one had
the primary, secondary,

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:21.500
and tertiary colors, this one
just had primary and secondary.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.440
And although it's a
bit rainbowy, you know,

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:29.080
you love having a
spectrum in a color book.

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:33.430
And while I'm printing books
like this, I keep all the prints

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:35.910
out on a table to just
sort of get a sense

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:37.210
of what everything is like.

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:39.980
And one day, Nancy
Loeber was in the studio.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.110
And she came over, and
she had her cup of coffee,

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:44.090
and she's just sort of looking.

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:47.800
And she puts her finger
right here and just says,

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.470
doesn't harmonious have two o's.

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:57.170
And so, I had printed a 16 press
run and a nine press run print

00:30:57.170 --> 00:31:05.670
with 10 words, one of
which was misspelled,

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:11.290
which ended up in me making
this final four press run print,

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:14.840
which is by far the best image.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:19.360
It only uses the
three primary colors.

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.350
You clearly see, when you
look at it closely at least,

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:24.380
how they modify each other.

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.780
And all of the other ones
had all this extraneous stuff

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:29.150
that wasn't necessary.

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:34.720
It just took like, you know,
three weeks of printing

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.790
and a case of raging
plantar fasciitis

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:39.140
to figure it out, you know.

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:44.670
It was like -- And, okay.

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:48.430
The last one is a book
I'm currently working on,

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:49.730
just a little thing.

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:52.350
I don't have anything of that
because it's at the binders now.

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:55.740
But for these book
character traits

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.570
that I just finished printing,

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:03.750
the book is about
digital letterforms,

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:05.440
and it explores the idea

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:10.320
that digital letterforms
are not typographic.

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.100
They have nothing
technologically in common

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:16.560
with typographic
letterforms, meaning metal type.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:21.480
And so, I wanted to make a book
where I designed lettering free

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:25.210
from the presumptions of what
typographic technology would

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:27.030
make you make letters for.

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:29.860
And because of that,
I decided, oh, well,

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.770
I shouldn't print
the letterforms

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:34.140
on a typographic press.

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.410
I should print them as etchings.

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:38.680
And I've only printed
two etchings before,

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.840
but I'm sure I can do it.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:47.620
And what's even better is
that by taking the plates

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:50.950
and inking the intaglio
lines and wiping the surface,

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:54.900
I can then roll a second
color onto the relief surface

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:59.040
and get these two colors
printed super vibrantly

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:02.640
at the same time, and
it'll be really cool.

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:06.820
And it is cool, until
I tried printing it

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.750
and realized that
what that meant.

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:14.690
It had never occurred to me
that I would then have to clean

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:17.250
between every print,
totally clean

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:20.700
with solvent the intolerable
lines and the surface

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.780
and let it dry, or else the
colors would contaminate

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:25.080
each other.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.380
And you'd only get
one good print.

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:30.070
And so, this is the
inking, the intaglio wiping,

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:34.980
the intaglio rolling up, dousing
solvent, scrubbing with a brush,

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:39.420
and waiting for the plate
to dry, which meant that,

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:43.690
at their worst, these prints
could take 30 minutes each

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:44.990
to make.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:47.380
And to give you an idea,
for the whole edition,

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:52.040
there were 2375 etchings
to be printed,

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:56.350
which I'm now really
good at printing.

00:33:56.350 --> 00:34:02.960
And so, the solution was
that the deluxe copies

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.790
of the book have more
two-color prints in them

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:08.680
than the standard
copies of the book.

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.900
So it allowed me to
do what I wanted to do

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.760
but in a more limited way.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:18.320
And the standard copies still
have some two-color prints.

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.590
But, you know, all of
these examples are things

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:25.760
that if you -- You know, Annie
and I have this joke where she,

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.380
you know, asks me how it
went in the studio today.

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:31.130
And I'll say, well,
I learned a lot.

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:38.850
That's when I'm in a good mood.

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:42.240
So at the time, these
feel kind of like torture,

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:46.700
each one of these things.

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:51.950
But without them, I would just
be doing the same thing over

00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:54.870
and over again, which I
have no tolerance to do.

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:57.490
And so, it's actually, you know,

00:34:57.490 --> 00:34:59.220
even though every
time it happens,

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:01.150
I say next time it's
going to be better,

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:04.570
it's actually the
only thing that has

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:06.820
to get better is my sort
of living with the fact

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:09.480
that things are going
to go horribly wrong.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:16.910
And so, to end, I love this
because I'm going to quote

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:18.790
from a publication that,

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:23.550
according to its publication
date, doesn't yet exist.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:26.640
The January 21st edition
of the New Yorker.

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.810
There was just this
perfect quote to end

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:34.530
from an article called Choose
Wisely by Joshua Rothman talking

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:37.700
about the philosopher
Agnes Callard.

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:41.650
He says, when we're aspiring,
inarticulateness isn't a sign

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:44.760
of unreasonableness
or incapacity.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:47.340
In fact, the opposite
may be true.

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:50.290
"Everyone goes to college
to become educated,"

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:53.210
Callard observes, "but
until I am educated,

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:55.830
I do not really know
what an education is

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:58.170
or why it is important."

00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:02.280
If we couldn't aspire to changes
that we struggle to describe,

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:06.370
we'd be trapped within the
ideas that we already have.

00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:09.300
Our inability to explain
our reasons is a measure

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.780
of how far we wish to travel.

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:15.020
It's only after an aspirant
has reached her destination,

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:19.650
Callard writes, that "she
will say, "This is why.

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:21.450
Thank you.

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:34.440
[ Applause ]

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.570
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: We have a
little bit of time for questions

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:38.940
if people would like to.

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:40.240
&gt;&gt; What's next?

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.740
&gt;&gt; Russell Maret:
It's a big secret.

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:48.720
No. I'm working on a --
I have a lot of ideas.

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:53.840
But I'm editing a book of
writing by Sandra Kirshenbaum,

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.440
who is the editor of
Fine Print Magazine.

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.040
That's going to be
published by the Book Club

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.440
of California this fall.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:06.650
I'm putting together a group
of essays of mine into a book

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:09.550
for publication by someone else.

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:15.560
But that won't be ready
probably to submit

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.860
until the end of the year.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:23.680
And yeah, and a couple
other things.

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:28.620
I'm really enjoying
this experimenting

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:32.380
with the differences
between typographic

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:34.920
and non-typographic letters.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:41.890
But one of the things that
character traits taught me was

00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:49.250
that -- You know, I draw these
kind of crazy letterforms,

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:52.360
you know, that verge
on abstraction,

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:56.750
and then I print
them individually.

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:59.460
But then when I print texts,

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:03.460
I design pretty traditional
looking typefaces.

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:10.310
And I've always wanted those
qualities to merge in some way.

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:14.000
But what character traits taught
me was that in order to do that,

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.370
the content of my
books needs to change.

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:21.120
My texts that I typically set

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:25.740
in my traditional
typefaces is usually notes

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:28.800
or an addendum to
some other work.

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:32.860
And so, I'm trying to
figure out what that means,

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:36.940
that somehow I need to start
working with texts that allow me

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:42.510
to experiment more
visually with words,

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:44.240
rather than having
them separate.

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:49.050
So I've got a couple ideas
of texts that I would

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:51.450
like to explore that with.

00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:55.780
But I've got a lot to
do in the meantime.

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.830
Yeah. Yeah?

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:01.900
&gt;&gt; In "Specimens of
Diverse Characters,"

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:03.860
can you talk a little bit
about your [inaudible]

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:08.190
and plate making to kind of
achieve some of the [inaudible]?

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:09.490
&gt;&gt; Russell Maret: Yeah.

00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:10.790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:14.090
So in the book "Specimens
of Diverse Characters,"

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:16.950
except for those two typefaces
and some metal ornaments,

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:20.750
everything is printed
from photopolymer plates,

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:22.330
which is primarily what I print

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:26.360
from because I design my
typefaces and letterforms

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:31.350
on the computer and I
output a film negative,

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:35.620
a laser film negative,
and then expose it

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:39.430
to a photopolymer plate that
makes a raised printing surface.

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:43.360
And in that book, there
are a number of prints.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:49.470
When you think of a
letterpress, you typically think

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:51.780
of line and void, you know.

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:56.510
It's either a solid printing
or there's no printing.

00:39:56.510 --> 00:40:00.230
But in this book, there's
a lot of overprinting

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:06.180
of subtle gradations of
color and tone that were made

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:11.210
by me just doing pencil
drawings on tracing paper

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:17.410
and scanning them and outputting
them as halftone film.

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:22.140
So I think those are the marks
you're talking about, yeah.

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:25.580
Some of them are quite precise,

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:31.410
but some of them are really just
me making a field of graphite

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:35.110
and then scanning it
and using it as texture.

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:42.400
But it's really wonderful
because, you know,

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:48.560
when you print one dot
halftone plate, it looks dotty.

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.670
It looks like it's
a bunch of dots.

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:55.050
When you print a second
different one on top of it,

00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:58.350
it starts to look more
like continuous tone.

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:04.130
And so, all of the sort of
gradations of color that you see

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:07.370
in that book are achieved
by printing at least two

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:12.260
and often four to six plates of
halftones on top of each other.

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:18.370
And so, there's still a little
bit of dottiness, but, you know,

00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:21.360
from this distance, it's
convincing, you know.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.290
Yeah. Yeah.

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:25.840
Anyone else?

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:27.140
Yes?

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:32.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So continuing on with
your use of computer or design,

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:38.920
have you gotten into working
with 3D at all on the computer,

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:43.240
3D capabilities, not to print
something in 3D, but actually

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:47.520
to manipulate forms
in 3D on the screen?

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:53.780
&gt;&gt; Russell Maret: You know, no,
not because I'm opposed to it.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:55.670
I'm one of those
people who works a lot

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:58.120
on the computer and
doesn't like it.

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:02.770
So I haven't been
very adventurous

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:09.140
in learning what the computer
can do beyond drawing outlines,

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:11.430
which is what I like
to do on the computer.

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:13.740
The outline gives me the form.

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:18.750
And I haven't even in
my book character traits

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:24.290
where I'm experimenting
with digital letterforms.

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:29.150
Most millennials would
think that what I came

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:31.890
up with was quite
conservative, I think.

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:37.000
They still look pretty much
like letterforms, you know.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.800
And so, I haven't
really gone deeply

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.750
into what something
that's just going to exist

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:47.360
in digital space can be.

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:51.920
But I like seeing it.

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:57.880
It's just that I really,
you know, drawing letters

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:00.170
on the computer, even
though I do it all the time,

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:01.670
is just excruciating.

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:05.140
It's so, you know, just
dot and pull it a little.

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:08.420
And it's just horrible.

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:12.620
So by the time I'm done with
the day, all I want to do is

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:16.740
like feel some oil on my
hands, you know, or something

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:18.410
and go to my print shop.

00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:22.490
So it's kind of nice
that I get to split that.

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:24.440
But yeah, no.

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.740
Yeah?

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:30.550
&gt;&gt; I have the good fortune,
we have the good fortune

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:33.560
of sitting near eclectic
geometric

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.220
and there's power
emanating off these things.

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:38.360
Can you talk about
the black hole?

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:41.080
Can you talk about the
technique and how [inaudible]?

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.380
&gt;&gt; Russell Maret: Yeah, yeah.

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:46.850
Each one of those, the drawings
are in pencil liquid watercolor.

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:49.320
Well, this one's just India ink

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:52.290
and then painted
in black gouache.

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:55.690
And that's what the black
is, which is that wonderful,

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:57.980
nonreflective, yeah, yeah.

00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:02.300
And even on the sort
of softer white paper

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:06.130
of eclectic geometric, it's
still -- And I love that,

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:09.400
that quality of the black.

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:11.910
&gt;&gt; India ink and gouache.

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:14.970
&gt;&gt; Russell Maret: So the way
it's done is every line is

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:19.340
either pencil, the blue
is liquid watercolor,

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:23.600
and then the black
lines and the outline

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:28.520
of the letters are India ink and
then basically then just painted

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:31.750
in the lines with black gouache.

00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:33.050
&gt;&gt; Edition of how many?

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:34.470
&gt;&gt; Russell Maret: Ten.

00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:37.560
Started in 2001.

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:42.850
I painted the last
one in 2008 I think.

00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:46.010
And actually, Nancy Loeber
painted about half of them.

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:51.860
I did all the drawing, but that
was the first thing she worked

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:55.160
for me on was painting
some of those.

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.880
&gt;&gt; They're elegant and powerful.

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.180
&gt;&gt; Russell Maret: Thanks.

00:44:58.180 --> 00:44:59.480
Thank you.

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.780
Yeah?

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:03.310
&gt;&gt; Are you familiar with
vantablack, which is --

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:04.610
&gt;&gt; Russell Maret:
Oh, it's the --

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:06.580
&gt;&gt; It's like 99.9 --

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.750
&gt;&gt; Russell Maret:
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:11.130
that what's his name owns.

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:13.450
Yeah, Anish Kapoor owns.

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:14.750
Yeah, yeah.

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:16.050
I've still never seen it.

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:17.350
But the --

00:45:17.350 --> 00:45:23.480
&gt;&gt; It'd be interesting to
have a print using that.

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:26.570
It takes a special lab to do it.

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:27.870
&gt;&gt; Russell Maret: Well, yeah.

00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:29.750
And he owns the color period.

00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:35.750
There's no Russell
getting to use vantablack.

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:37.420
So, but he's -- Yeah.

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:38.910
&gt;&gt; You don't need it.

00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:40.210
You don't need it

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:41.510
&gt;&gt; Russell Maret:
Well, thank you.

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:42.810
Thank you.

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:45.800
But I love Anish Kapoor's
work, and I have felt

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:49.100
that in recent years, it's
gotten a little too glossy.

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:52.470
And so, it'll be really
fun to see what he does

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:55.460
with something you
can't see actually.

00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:58.330
I mean, that's what's
so amazing about it.

00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:02.670
It's just an absence of
light, which is incredible.

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:08.960
But yeah, it's for him to
play with and me to admire.

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:11.270
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: I
think we'll stop there.

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:15.260
Before we thank Russell, if
the people sitting on benches

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:18.740
in front of the table can get
up and push the benches in,

00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:20.840
people can come and
look at books.

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:23.450
We'll be happy to show you
whatever you like to see.

00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:26.490
Keep in mind that some of
these books don't belong to us.

00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:29.580
So we're asking you to
be extra mindful today.

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:30.880
But we're happy --

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.180
&gt;&gt; Russell Maret: But
not to touch them.

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:34.850
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation:
Yeah, just not touch.

00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:37.220
But we'll be happy to
show you whatever we can.

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:39.510
And let's thank Russell
for a great job.

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:41.900
