00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.458
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:02.958 --> 00:00:06.420
KATY PRATT: Thanks, and hello.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.730
CLAYTON PRATT: Hello.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.920
KATY PRATT: So I'm
Katy Pratt, and this

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.380
is my husband, Clayton.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.750
CLAYTON PRATT: I'm a
third-year medical student

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.530
at the University of Michigan.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.740
KATY PRATT: And I
am a Googler, here.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.340
I have been at Google for in
total, three and a half years,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.660
but did leave for a
year, and then came back.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.040
And work on gTech,
supporting Google Analytics.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.530
CLAYTON PRATT: Many of you
probably have recognized Katy,

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.850
she works here.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.360
If you recognize me, it might
be because you've recently

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.090
seen me on one of
your featured Learning

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.810
on the Loo advertisements--

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:38.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.240
--in the stalls at Google.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.290
I didn't actually know Learning
on the Loo was a thing.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.780
Over at the hospital,
bathroom stalls

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.260
are used for urine
samples, not advertising.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.990
But what do we know?

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.020
While you guys are busy hanging
out and pinging each other,

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.090
we still send alphanumeric
pages and then run

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.770
across the hospital
looking for a phone

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.853
to get back to each other.

00:01:00.853 --> 00:01:02.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.890
On July 1st, 2014, Katy
and I packed up our house,

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.550
and put three or four outfits,
our camping and bicycle repair

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.090
equipment, a MacBook
Air, and two smartphones

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.020
in these four yellow panniers,
a frame bag, and this duffel bag

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.930
with all of our
camping equipment.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.160
And we flew to Heathrow
International Airport,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.710
in London, England.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.380
Our flight landed at
6:45 AM, and wanting

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.910
to make the trip as difficult
and as rigorous as possible,

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.410
we assembled our bicycle in
the fourth level parking lot

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.170
at the airport.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.380
And six hours
later, around noon,

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.970
after Katy went and found a
piece that we actually forgot,

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.760
we hopped on our bike.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.360
We started in London,
and we went north.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.170
First to Edinburgh, and then
across Europe to Istanbul.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.270
We ran into some problems
that we will talk about.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.840
We spent two months
in Nepal and India.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.890
And then three months
in Southeast Asia,

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.920
before two weeks in Utah,
completing our 10,000

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.759
kilometer, 28 country, 280
day across the world trip.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.760
It was, by far, the
best trip of our lives.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.100
But, to be clear, it wasn't
the best trip of our life

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.380
because we went to
Thailand and sat on a beach

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.430
for a year and sipped
mango smoothies.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.980
We only did that for two weeks.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.530
Our trip wasn't
exactly a vacation.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.380
It was a wonderfully enjoyable,
but incredibly difficult

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.540
adventure, full of highs
and lows, exhilaration

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.110
and frustration.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.420
Each week, many obstacles
forced us to live and operate

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.390
outside of our comfort zone.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.300
An abbreviated list
of these obstacles

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.210
might include saddle
sores, tingling fingers,

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.930
and neck aches from
sitting on a bike 10 hours

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.440
a day, day, after
day, after day.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.400
It would include flat
tires, broken spokes,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.270
and other mechanical issues.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.460
It would include visa
logistics, the fear

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.750
of financial irresponsibility,
and rationalizing our decision

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.170
to postpone parenthood.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.650
Add to that poor
road quality, cycling

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.980
in the rain, oppressive heat,
and mountains beyond mountains.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.960
Plus a possible
malaria infection,

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.400
and oncoming cows in India.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.770
And the list really is endless.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.850
In 280 days, we slept
in 169 different places.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.300
Most of those places had
beds, but not all of them.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.980
From the moment
we reached France,

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.770
until we landed on American
soil, almost nine months later,

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.220
we really didn't know how
to talk to most people,

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.080
because we only
really speak English.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.960
Our communication was
done by smiling, pointing,

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.260
and counting on our fingers.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.494
In the Alps it rained
for a week straight.

00:03:46.494 --> 00:03:48.410
Instead of staying inside
waiting for the rain

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.390
to blow over, and instead of
putting on my new Patagonia

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.270
rain jacket, I decided
to cycle in nothing

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.340
more than socks,
shoes, and Spandex.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.980
Because I quickly
learned that skin

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.710
dries out faster than clothing.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.520
And once you're completely wet,
and you can't get any wetter,

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.270
cycling in the rain
really isn't that bad,

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.440
and maybe even enjoyable.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.250
Cycling across the world forced
us out of our comfort zone.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.040
The way we responded to
these difficult situations,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.930
once outside our
comfort zone, dictated

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.587
how our day, and our week, and
our trip ultimately would go.

00:04:23.587 --> 00:04:25.420
Today we're going to
tell a few stories that

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.000
highlight this point.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.600
And, if by some strange chance,
by the end of our talk someone

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.390
is deciding to turn in
their resignation at Google,

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.640
I will consider
our talk a success.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.683
Just kidding, keep your jobs.

00:04:40.683 --> 00:04:41.183
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:41.183 --> 00:04:42.682
KATY PRATT: Plus,
we can't say that.

00:04:42.682 --> 00:04:43.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.270
All right.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.390
So, before our trip my
life was very structured.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.090
I rode the same bus to work,
I came to the same office,

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.370
I sat at the same desk,
I had breakfast and lunch

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.280
in the same cafe-- on
floor five that all of you

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.890
have lunch and breakfast on.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.650
I would go home
to the same house,

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.160
and sleep in the
same bed every night.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.380
Now, my routine was comfortable.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.290
And I was good at it.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.100
I liked it.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.030
But biking across the world,
our routine definitely changed.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.120
So, early on, I tried to
apply my desire for routine

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.850
and structure to our trip.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.660
Every morning I wanted to know,
how far are we going to bike?

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.170
Is the road going to be flat?

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.309
Is it going to be hilly?

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:28.600
Are we going to encounter wind?

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.120
Are we going to encounter rain?

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.130
I need to know these things.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.600
So, have we found a place
to stay every night?

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.300
And will I have a
place to shower?

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.020
I like showering.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.570
Sticky, sweaty, legs at the
end of the day in your sleeping

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.550
bag, or in a bed,
are not, not fun.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.300
So the answer to a
lot of these problems

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.970
was solved by Google
Maps bicycling directions

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:51.730
and weather apps.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.520
So I looked at Google Maps
a lot in England and France.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.620
But once we got to Italy,
Google Maps bicycling directions

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.400
failed.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.410
They totally didn't exist.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.800
So I didn't know what to do.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.150
My whole idea of planning,
and being mentally prepared

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.250
each day, changed.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.820
In Austria, someone told
us about another website

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.100
that we can use, so I
tried that for a while,

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.900
but in Albania
everything failed.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.470
The second largest highway
in the whole country

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.470
turned out to be
a washed out road,

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.860
that we just rode down in, and
rode through puddles and mud.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.490
And it got worse
as we went east.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.320
In India, cities that
exist on Google Maps

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.080
didn't always appear
in the same places.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.520
Or places that were
supposed to have towns

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.760
weren't always towns.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.980
So at some point on our trip
we stopped checking maps

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.830
and weather, knowing
the elevation,

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.880
booking or looking
for a place to stay.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.230
You kind of get to a state of
knowing whatever happens today,

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.340
we can do.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.440
But it wasn't an
immediate switch.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.240
It took being OK with not being
able to control everything,

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.330
and being OK with that.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.460
And then some awesome
experiences happen.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.660
So the first one I want to talk
to you about is wild camping.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.590
So this is exactly
what it sounds

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.210
like, you camp in the wild.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.430
As in, you stop on
the side of the road,

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.620
and just pitch your tent.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.670
So this was totally
foreign to me,

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.640
and my rule-following self
had a hard time with this,

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.830
because it's illegal
in some places.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:34.020
But you have to do it at times,
because hotels, or locals

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.740
to befriend don't exist.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.830
So knew this was going to be
a thing going into our trip.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.670
But before we got better
the wild camping process,

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.340
we were bad at it.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.660
One specific time, we
were looking for a place.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.010
It was after dark, which
was our first mistake.

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:51.700
We're down a dirt road.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.220
We're like, this
place looks good,

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.950
although we can't see
anything, because it's dark.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.990
So we're about to
get off the bike when

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:01.810
we hear a pack of wild dogs
start barking and running

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:03.050
towards us.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.110
So, clearly, not a good
place to wild camp.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:09.340
So I made us pack up and
backtrack to the last town.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.870
Now, as we got
better at this, we

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:16.461
had one wild camping experience
on the Po River, where we--

00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:17.460
CLAYTON PRATT: In Italy.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.600
KATY PRATT: In Italy, where
we found a perfect spot.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.340
We found a place with water.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.020
This was going to be great.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.920
So we set up our camp.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.389
We were doing everything
we should be doing,

00:08:29.389 --> 00:08:30.930
and it was going to
be a great night.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.270
The moon was out, the
river was beautiful,

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.220
there weren't too
many mosquitoes.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.419
But then some local
teenagers decided

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:39.070
our spot was pretty great, too.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:40.630
So they joined us.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.829
So all night we
listened to techno music

00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:44.870
on the side of the river.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:45.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.060
So, again, being outside
of your comfort zone.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.340
And although we didn't have
the best sleep that night,

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.140
it was OK.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.370
And it seemed to work out.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:58.960
So we definitely got
better at wild camping.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.530
Now the last kind
of experience I

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.446
wanted to talk to you
about, with the unknown,

00:09:02.446 --> 00:09:03.920
it was in Thailand.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.260
So we went from
Laos to Thailand.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:11.650
And Laos is a kind of third
world communist country

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:14.770
that has more dirt roads,
things were more primitive.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:18.160
But in Thailand, things
are much more westernized.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.790
Lots of paved roads.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.830
So we got to Thailand,
and Clayton got nervous.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.800
Our dirt road adventures
were going to end.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.060
What are we going to do?

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.052
So our day, going
from town A to town B,

00:09:29.052 --> 00:09:31.260
he thought, maybe we shouldn't
take the direct route.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.850
I think there's a pretty
good road this way.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.840
I think we should go this way.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.000
And I thought, OK,
we'll get there.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.010
Why not?

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:41.970
So we followed what we
thought was this road.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.050
Which turned into a dirt road.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.450
Which turned out to
be pretty washed out.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.740
We crossed multiple rivers.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:52.530
It turns out we had to climb
three mountains on a dirt road

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.290
the size of maybe
two of our tandems,

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.850
and actually push it
over these mountains.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:01.280
And we're talking, like,
push, as in like this,

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.480
up and over these mountains.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.160
It was hard.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.690
It was not in our
route, but it was fun.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.470
And being OK outside
of our comfort zone

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:12.361
made me and Clayton OK with
this kind of experience,

00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:13.610
which is why it was enjoyable.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.260
CLAYTON PRATT: I would like to
talk about bike maintenance.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.390
The thought of keeping this
loaded tandem up and running

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.420
for multiple countries and
thousands of kilometers

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.510
started out as a
pretty daunting ask.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:37.010
Questions I had were, what if in
Serbia we get four flat tires?

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.610
What do we do?

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.960
What if in Turkey we get
in an accident and the rim

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.530
on our front wheel
bends a little bit?

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:46.230
What do we do?

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:50.020
What if we break a chain while
we're climbing in the Alps?

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.140
There were a lot of
things that I didn't know.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.040
Before leaving, I
said, Katy, how many

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.190
spare spokes do you think we
should bring for our trip?

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:02.600
To which she said, are we
going to break any spokes?

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.830
And I said, I don't know.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:07.450
There were a lot
of I don't knows,

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.950
and there was a seemingly
endless list of things

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:12.350
that could go wrong.

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:16.050
The easy solution is just
take it to a bike shop,

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:18.270
they'll fix it.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:22.200
From the best of my
research, I discovered

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.550
that east of, maybe, Austria,
everything was up for grabs.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:30.630
Eastern Europe, you might
be able to find a bike shop.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:34.070
There was one really good
touring bike shop in Istanbul.

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:40.750
Everything between Istanbul and
Bangkok, don't expect anything.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:45.110
So I kind of had the idea that
we needed to bring everything

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.060
that we needed.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.560
If we did find a
bike shop in one

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.290
of these small, rural,
third world countries,

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:55.240
it was likely that the repair
equipment that they had

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.410
would not work for our bicycle.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:02.410
In the West, most wheels are
700 millimeters in diameter,

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:05.570
and in the developing
world, all bicycles

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:09.070
have 26 inch wheels, similar
to our mountain bikes.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.730
So if we found anything there,
tubes, tires, spokes, none

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.210
of them might be the right size.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.350
With this sort of
nervous energy,

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.460
the following
happened on our trip.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:24.970
In Northeastern
Slovenia, I started

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:28.260
to hear a weird clunking sound.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:32.610
I'm a little bit anal, and a
clunking sound isn't so bad.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:34.070
A little rubbing isn't bad.

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:37.680
But a little bit of rubbing
for 8,000 kilometers

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.740
is just going to completely
destroy whatever's rubbing.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.590
So I started worrying.

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:45.020
The sound intensified
somewhere in Austria.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.970
Katy started hearing it, too.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:47.920
And it was strange.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.960
The clucking sound came,
not when we were pedaling,

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.850
but when we stopped pedaling.

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:54.854
Usually you hear sounds
when you're pedaling.

00:12:54.854 --> 00:12:56.270
That's when the
chains are moving.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.780
That's when pedals are moving.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:01.260
But this sound kind of came
right when we stopped pedaling.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.470
And I didn't really
know what was going on.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.450
We stayed with a
Warm Shower host--

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.180
which we'll talk about
in a bit-- in Vienna.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.860
And this person, who had done
lots of previous touring,

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.990
suggested the problem might
be due to a new rear cassette

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.075
that we got to climb
mountains easier.

00:13:17.075 --> 00:13:18.450
And it might have
to do something

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.010
with the length of our chain.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.190
So I tried some adjustments,
took a couple links out

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:24.220
of our chain.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.080
And the problem came back.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.170
By the time we got to
Budapest, the problem

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.740
was pretty constant, and
I was kind of in denial.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.000
Thinking, I don't
know what's going on.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.950
There's some weird
noise back there.

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:37.180
I'd always ask Katy if
she knew what's going on.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.870
She had no idea what's going on.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:40.370
KATY PRATT: I'm not
a bike mechanic.

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:41.339
That was his job.

00:13:41.339 --> 00:13:43.380
CLAYTON PRATT: I'm trying
to listen through Katy,

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.380
and all of these bags.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:46.830
We got to a bike
shop in Budapest,

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.480
just as it was closing, and
they said come back in on Monday

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.230
morning.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.460
And Katie and I
were like, no, we

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.110
don't want to give
up a whole weekend.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:55.190
So we pushed on.

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:57.590
They told us to go to a town
in southern Hungary called

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:58.720
[INAUDIBLE].

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.850
Luckily, three
days later I found

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:02.690
someone who speaks
English to translate

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:05.320
my problems to our bike
mechanic, who actually

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.490
was a very good bike mechanic,
and only charged us $2 or $3.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:11.530
And he said the
problem with our bike

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:15.490
was that inside the rear hub
there is a free wheel coasting

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:18.550
mechanism, which allows
the wheel to roll,

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.452
and the pedals to not move,
and let your bike coast.

00:14:21.452 --> 00:14:22.910
He said there was
a bunch of grease

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:24.424
in there for an unknown reason.

00:14:24.424 --> 00:14:26.340
And he showed me some
pictures, it had kind of

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.506
been chewed up a little bit.

00:14:27.506 --> 00:14:30.110
But he cleaned it out,
threw some oil in there.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.850
I wasn't exactly convinced,
but the next day our bike

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:34.170
was perfect.

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.330
It worked great.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:41.600
Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia,
Macedonia, everything

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.540
was going good.

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.560
And then we got to Albania,
and we're descending a mountain

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.100
just south of Tirana.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.960
And out of nowhere-- we're
going 40 miles an hour--

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.770
this just screaming,
crashing, clunking,

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.312
awful sound just comes
right out of our rear wheel.

00:14:57.312 --> 00:14:59.270
And I know instantly that
that problem is back,

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:01.790
and it is much
worse than it was.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.400
Slammed on the brakes,
Katy and I both get off,

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.210
I throw the bike on the ground,
probably say a few swear words.

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.590
Katy picks the bike back up.

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:14.200
And I'm thinking, all right,
the town's down there,

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.410
we can see it in the
distance, we'll walk there.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.490
We couldn't even
walk the bicycle,

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:22.070
because the wheel could not roll
if the pedals were not moving.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:25.960
So we said, all right,
we'll just pedal downhill.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.740
So we got on the bike,
shifted into the hardest gear,

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.364
and we pedaled all
the way downhill.

00:15:31.364 --> 00:15:33.530
And after a while, I'm
thinking, this is ridiculous.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:35.460
If this hub is ruined,
let's just ruin it.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.502
So I stopped pedaling.

00:15:37.502 --> 00:15:38.710
But the sound didn't show up.

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:41.334
And I'm thinking, all right, now
we have bicycle that's broken,

00:15:41.334 --> 00:15:43.600
only when it wants to be.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.680
The next day, in Elbasan,
I thought, all right,

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.400
wheel's ruined.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.200
What should we do?

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.260
We get on the bike that
morning, totally fine.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.100
So now it's like, all right,
bike's got a mind of it's own.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.600
We're just going to continue.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.670
If disaster strikes,
disaster strikes.

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:03.876
That was in Albania.

00:16:03.876 --> 00:16:06.000
We got to Macedonia, there
were some more problems.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.527
We went to another
bike mechanic,

00:16:07.527 --> 00:16:09.360
I told him what the
other bike mechanic did,

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.710
he did the exact same thing.

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:13.030
Pull out some grease,
put in some lubricant.

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:14.900
And that got us a
couple more days.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.890
But by the time we got
to Thessaloniki, Greece,

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:21.620
it was nonstop pedaling,
never allowed to coast,

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.400
bumper to bumper traffic,
pretty miserable cycling.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.110
We were a week out from
Istanbul, and we're like,

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:30.152
all right, Greece,
developed country,

00:16:30.152 --> 00:16:31.860
we're going to find
a real bike mechanic,

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.240
we're getting this fixed.

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.480
Luckily, we find a bike mechanic
right next to our hostel.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.600
And we go in there, he says,
no, no, no, no, this other thing

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.380
is your problem.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.410
Fix this.

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:44.440
And we're like, all
right, whatever.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:47.930
The next morning, we're climbing
up this really steep hill,

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.850
and we've just gone down the
other side of this steep hill.

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:51.840
Problem comes back.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.900
And we're like, you've
got to be kidding me.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:57.180
Hitchhike back to Greece,
back to Thessaloniki.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.530
Tell him the problem.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.910
He decides to try to
fix the other problem.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:03.420
And then, to make
sure it's fixed,

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.295
and because it kind of
has a mind of its own,

00:17:05.295 --> 00:17:07.887
I go cycling up and down the
coast for two hours, trying

00:17:07.887 --> 00:17:09.720
to elicit this problem,
because I don't want

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.250
to leave if it's still broken.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:12.140
It's fine.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.589
Go up the hill, coming
back down the other side,

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:16.130
problem comes back.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:19.750
And it's just-- Katy
and I, we sit down

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:22.650
on this side of the
highway, 30 meters apart,

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:26.619
bicycle in the middle,
don't talk to each other.

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:29.900
And then there was kind of
this, like, aha moment of,

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.065
our wheel is definitely broken.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:38.200
And all of our worrying about
it definitely being broken.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.410
Is it going to work, is
it not going to work?

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:40.350
All of that disappeared.

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:42.266
And all of the sudden
we got over that hurdle,

00:17:42.266 --> 00:17:44.070
and it was like,
our wheel is broken.

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:45.990
And so Katy said, so,
should we hitchhike?

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.440
Katy's a pretty good hitchhiker.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.899
KATY PRATT: It's
a skill I learned.

00:17:49.899 --> 00:17:51.565
CLAYTON PRATT: Istanbul
was a week away,

00:17:51.565 --> 00:17:53.510
and I wasn't just
going to say, our wheel

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:54.997
has problems, let's hitchhike.

00:17:54.997 --> 00:17:56.580
So I said, we're
going to cycle there.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.730
And if we destroy our
wheel, we destroy our wheel.

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:02.410
So for seven straight days we
cycled all the way to Istanbul,

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:05.800
into a headwind,
never able to coast.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.080
It was pretty miserable.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.310
Oh, one thing I need to add.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:13.920
When the wheel totally
went kaput, I got online,

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.100
and I ordered a new
hub from the States,

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.590
to be shipped to
a Warm Shower host

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:22.300
that we would be staying with,
similar to couch surfing,

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.310
in Istanbul.

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:26.120
We cycle our seven days,
we get to Istanbul,

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.506
we go to our Warm
Shower host's home.

00:18:28.506 --> 00:18:30.300
The hub doesn't show up.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.220
It's stuck in customs.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.170
It's stuck there for a week.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.650
We finally get it out,
thanks to the help of someone

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:38.710
that we were staying
with at the time.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.136
Take it to a bike shop, he
says, great, I'll fix it.

00:18:41.136 --> 00:18:43.260
Katy and I get on a bus
and we go to central Turkey

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:44.500
to site see.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.180
Get an email from
the guy, and he says,

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:50.990
sorry, your rear hub lacks an
attachment for a disk rotor.

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.120
If you put this on, you
won't have a rear brake

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.780
for the rest of your trip.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.620
And I'm like stabbing
myself in the face.

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.120
Like, you have got
to be kidding me.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.290
How many problems can go wrong?

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:02.980
Call up the guy in
the states, say, hey,

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.780
will you send this attachment?

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.300
We'd like to have two brakes.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.910
But knowing that customs
is a huge problem, I think,

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.730
we need a backup plan.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:13.940
So I order another
one, and send it

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:17.700
to my sister, who's coming to
meet us in Nepal a month later.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.186
We get back to Istanbul,
the part never arrives.

00:19:20.186 --> 00:19:21.310
We go to Israel for a week.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:22.851
We come back, it
still never arrives.

00:19:22.851 --> 00:19:25.000
We leave Istanbul
six weeks later,

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.050
and the only thing on our to-do
list, fix our rear wheel, still

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:29.780
had not happened.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.740
We arrived in Nepal, my
sister gives us the new hub,

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:37.260
I get on Google, and I
look at every single bike

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.910
shop in Kathmandu.

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:41.440
And per Google, I found the
best one, Himalayan Singletrack.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.360
I take my hub and my wheel.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.499
We're basically turning
over the rest of our trip.

00:19:49.499 --> 00:19:52.040
I take it to this Nepali, who
speaks a little bit of English,

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.900
and I said, can you
rebuild this wheel?

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.060
Are you sure?

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:57.986
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:57.986 --> 00:19:59.250
And I was like, all right.

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:01.482
What other options do we have?

00:20:01.482 --> 00:20:03.310
Katy and I, and my
sister, my mother,

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:05.750
we go off trekking in
the Himalayas for a week.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:07.314
We come back, early
in the morning,

00:20:07.314 --> 00:20:09.230
and I'm walking up to
the bike shop by myself,

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:10.840
and I'm just terrified.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.040
Is our trip going to continue?

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.560
I walked into the shop,
and in the corner,

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.680
on an unswept dirty
floor, is a pile

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.340
of spokes, a hub, and my rim.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:23.420
And I'm thinking, you've
got to be kidding me.

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:25.580
We don't have a
bicycle that works.

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:28.030
I said, what's going on?

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:29.220
You haven't done anything?

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.680
He says, well, this
problem, this--

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.780
No, no, no.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:33.080
The spokes are the right size.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.220
The hub's the right size.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.009
It's all right.

00:20:36.009 --> 00:20:37.050
You said you can do this.

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:39.360
I'm coming back in an hour
to see if you've started.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.190
Come back in an hour,
there's nobody in the store.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:43.342
And I'm thinking--

00:20:43.342 --> 00:20:45.175
KATY PRATT: Things run
a little differently.

00:20:45.175 --> 00:20:47.540
CLAYTON PRATT: I'm
thinking, all right,

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:52.140
either our trip ends, or I find
out how to rebuild a wheel.

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.360
Because that was where we were.

00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:59.850
Professional bike
mechanics, when

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:03.300
they want to build a wheel,
they use truing stands,

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.820
and calibrated
instruments that help

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.810
you measure the
tension on your spokes,

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:11.750
to make sure that
everything is correct.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:13.870
I did not have any
of these things.

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:16.300
In my guest house
in Kathmandu, I

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:20.420
had a cheap multitool,
a piece of fabric ruler,

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:24.990
and was one of those floss
picks to use as a straight edge.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:28.390
And that is what I used
to rebuild our wheel.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.740
Instead of using a
tension meter to find out

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:34.050
if the spokes were tight
enough, I plucked the spokes

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:38.410
like guitar strings, to see
how much tension there was.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:39.860
Because one side
of the wheel was

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.485
supposed to be tighter than the
other side, based on which side

00:21:42.485 --> 00:21:43.410
the chain is on.

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:44.990
I went back to the
bike shop, and I

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:48.290
plucked all of the spokes
of the industry-made bikes,

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:52.960
to see if that tension matched
the tension on my wheel.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.830
I watched a lot of YouTube
videos, I read a lot of blogs.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:58.400
And I was on a little
bit of a time frame

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:02.770
crunch, because my sister
was leaving 18 hours later.

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:05.050
And so I had that night
to rebuild our wheel,

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:07.497
or send our bicycle home,
because our bike didn't work.

00:22:10.814 --> 00:22:12.230
The only thing
that kind of scared

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:15.260
me was that I didn't just need
to build a decent wheel, that

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:19.070
could just roll down
a normal paved road.

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:21.410
We were heading into
Nepal, and India,

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:24.870
with potholes galore, bad roads.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:29.250
We were carrying 400, 500 pounds
on our bike, and all of this

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:30.750
is resting on our rear wheel.

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:34.010
So I had to do a pretty damn
good job if our trip was

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:36.620
going to continue.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:39.790
But it all worked out.

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:41.720
When I was put up
against the wall,

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.860
with no other options left, six
bike mechanics had failed me,

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.960
a problem for the last
three months, everything

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.490
that everybody had
tried had failed,

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:51.180
I'd done everything
I possibly could.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.700
When pushed right
up against that wall

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.210
I was able to figure it out.

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:58.130
And that night I
rebuilt our wheel,

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:00.780
and we cycled through all of
India without a broken spoke,

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:04.140
of and without having
to re-true our wheel.

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.180
When we get outside
of our comfort zone,

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.650
either because we choose
to-- or in my case,

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:10.620
because we are
forced to-- we can

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.530
begin to realize what
our potential is,

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:14.430
and what we are capable of.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.320
I learned more
about wheel building

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:19.130
and about fixing
problems that night,

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:21.830
than I would have in
the next 50 years.

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:25.242
I would have just taken
it to a bike shop.

00:23:25.242 --> 00:23:27.450
This rear wheel was the
biggest nuisance of our trip,

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.241
but I couldn't be
happier with the outcome.

00:23:29.241 --> 00:23:31.870
I solved a problem that we
both thought was impossible,

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.855
and our trip was
able to continue.

00:23:34.855 --> 00:23:36.980
KATY PRATT: It's true, he
did do a really good job.

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.660
And I was very little help.

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:42.547
I ran for tools,
down the street.

00:23:42.547 --> 00:23:44.130
So the last part I
want to talk about,

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:45.838
with getting outside
of our comfort zone,

00:23:45.838 --> 00:23:47.360
is something called
Warm Showers.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.650
Clayton mentioned this briefly.

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:53.690
So warmshowers.org is
not just a warm shower.

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:56.560
It's a website similar
to couch surfing.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.840
A reciprocal kind of
hosting site, where

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:00.280
anyone can become a member.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:04.300
You go online, and then you look
at this map, and you see hosts,

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.530
and you email them
for a place to stay.

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:10.550
Now, Warm Showers is
specific to bike touring.

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:14.380
So often, people who are hosts
are bike tourers themselves,

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.830
and have used the site
on their own tour.

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:19.710
And the norm of Warm Showers,
unlike couch surfing,

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:22.590
is the host provides you
with dinner, breakfast,

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:24.680
and a free place to stay.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.170
So this is a pretty big
deal for bike tourers.

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:30.600
And then you learn about all
the various roads to go on,

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.310
and all the details of
the local area you are in.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:36.120
Now why would Warm
Showers be problematic?

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.400
When I was growing up, my
family went on vacations,

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.200
we stayed at hotels, we
did adventurous things.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.650
But we didn't stay
at strangers' houses.

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:49.650
My parents taught me, like all
of you, to be self-sufficient.

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:52.660
I was a professional who'd had
a job at Google for three years.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.840
Surely I could afford
a place to stay.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.160
But night after night for a
year was stretching our budget.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.230
So Warm Showers meant relying
on the kindness of strangers,

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:04.680
which felt very foreign.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.790
Now there are the normal
concerns you have.

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:08.875
Cleanliness, going into
someone else's house,

00:25:08.875 --> 00:25:11.590
do they have the same standard
of cleanliness as you do?

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:15.460
You can't really tell
from a picture or a blurb.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.240
Safety, going into
a stranger's home,

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.770
we don't know who
they actually are.

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:21.520
The awkwardness of trying
to talk to a stranger.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.160
Not everyone's a very
good conversationalist.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.720
Before our first Warm
Shower experience,

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.430
I casually asked Clayton,
what if they kill us?

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:36.050
And he turned to me and said,
well, what if we kill them?

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:37.820
Which was a valid point.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.543
However, it never
got to this point,

00:25:39.543 --> 00:25:41.380
and we never actually worried.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.630
So I definitely
recommend Warm Showers.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.200
We originally kind of did this
with the intent of, oh, this

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.090
will help our trip last longer,
we'll meet these people.

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:52.470
But really, Warm Showers
was so much more,

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:54.840
and such a crucial
part of our trip.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.750
I'm going to share a few
stories, or just a few people

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:00.390
that we've met along the
way, through Warm Showers.

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:02.822
So the first is
in Eastern France.

00:26:02.822 --> 00:26:05.390
I don't know, you can
kind of see from that,

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:06.810
over there, Clayton.

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:08.630
Monsieur and Madame Bertier.

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:12.470
They spoke no English, and
we spoke very little French.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:15.662
Clayton took classes
in junior high school.

00:26:15.662 --> 00:26:18.250
Their son signed up for Warm
Showers, and he wasn't home,

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:20.160
but he said, my
parents will host you.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.750
We had a picturesque
evening on a farm in France,

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:26.170
and ended up having the
best dessert of our trip.

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:29.680
Lots of signs, and
smiling, and since they

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.800
lived on a farm, lots
of farm animal noises,

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.550
which we became very good at.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:40.190
They also led us into the whole
aspect of a cheese course.

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:43.120
The French really do have a
whole section of their meal

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.100
related to cheese.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.190
And we've got to try so
many amazing cheeses.

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.950
Now the next one is
Bashar, in Istanbul.

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:51.430
Clayton mentioned him.

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:53.820
He was the Warm Shower
host who helped us out

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:57.500
with our bike hub.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:01.015
We were able to ship
the part to his house.

00:27:01.015 --> 00:27:02.610
He helped us with customs.

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:05.970
He helped us figure out
who to pay and when to pay.

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:10.760
And how to actually get a
part out of customs in Turkey.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.230
He let us stay in his
house for what ended up

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:15.520
being two weeks,
which was significant,

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.970
because he had a
flat in the city,

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:21.660
and he stayed at his house
two hours outside of the city.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:27.390
So one way, twice a day, he was
commuting to his other home,

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:29.780
because he wanted to
show us hospitality,

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.330
and let us stay at his house.

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:35.770
Now, when our bike
part was not there.

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:38.760
Sorry, I keep
dropping-- thank you.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.480
He let us keep our
luggage at his house,

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.660
all the while showing us local
sites, local restaurants,

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.470
and local foods.

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:49.620
Now another one is [INAUDIBLE]
and Alesh in Slovenia.

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.270
They stopped us on
the side of the road,

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:55.600
because we were riding a
tandem, and they ride a tandem.

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.650
And they invited us
over to their house.

00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:00.040
They said, you absolutely
have to come stay with us.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.060
Now what's unique about
[INAUDIBLE] and Alesh

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:05.370
is Alesh is blind,
and he sits on back.

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:07.290
And [INAUDIBLE]
sits in the front.

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:09.780
He was so intrigued
to see another tandem,

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:13.140
he ran his hands over all
the parts and components,

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.890
and asked so many questions.

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:18.500
The last one is Rene in Laos.

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.780
He's a German ex-pat
living there doing

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:26.260
microlending for the
surrounding 135 villages.

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:31.056
He up and moved to Laos
knowing zero language, just

00:28:31.056 --> 00:28:32.430
to make a difference,
and thought

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:34.470
it would be a great experience.

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:36.020
Now lots of people
might think he's

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:38.470
a little crazy for
wanting to do this,

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:42.690
but he was making a difference,
and had such a positive outlook

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:43.410
on life.

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:45.000
He took us trekking
in the jungle,

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.130
swimming at the
local swimming hole.

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:48.900
He took us to the
sauna, which is

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:52.870
how he met and became
friends with, and learned

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:56.610
how to speak in the language.

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:58.410
He was outside of
his comfort zone.

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:01.410
Now we were lucky enough
to meet people on our trip,

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:04.490
and lucky enough to be
able to have the experience

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:06.060
to interact with them.

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:10.090
Now you don't necessarily
have to go across the world

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:13.020
and use Warm Showers
to be able to meet

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.450
interesting and new people.

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:16.176
You have to be open to it.

00:29:16.176 --> 00:29:18.050
Whether it's smiling at
people in the grocery

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:20.800
store, or saying hi to
people on the street.

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.800
Even here at Google,
I think, oh my gosh,

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.430
there are other people on
floors that I don't know,

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:28.500
that I don't even
necessarily say hi to.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.530
So it's just being
open to new people,

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:33.980
and being open to being
outside of your comfort zone,

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.690
that you can really have
an impactful difference

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:39.937
in your life, and people can
make a difference in your life.

00:29:39.937 --> 00:29:41.645
That's one thing that's
really important.

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:48.530
CLAYTON PRATT: In closing,
briefly, much of our life

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:49.300
is routine.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.750
We are creatures of
habit and comfort,

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:55.680
and we repeatedly do what
we are used to doing.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.140
That's not always bad,
but it doesn't always

00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.609
have to be like that.

00:29:59.609 --> 00:30:01.150
Yes, Katy and I were
fortunate enough

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:04.840
to be able to go on a once
in a lifetime journey.

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:08.292
However, the journey is
over, and it is our hope

00:30:08.292 --> 00:30:09.750
that we have learned
things that we

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:13.390
will be able to do and remember
for the rest of our lives.

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:16.280
We discovered how much fun
it is to meet new people.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.860
To talk to people that we
didn't know when we woke up

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:22.790
that morning, especially people
who are very different from us.

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:26.200
We learned how to deal with the
unknown, and to be OK with it.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.765
To accept difficulty,
and hardship,

00:30:28.765 --> 00:30:31.620
and in change in routines,
and know that in the end,

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:33.670
everything will work out.

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:35.290
We learned that
sometimes, if we step

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:38.410
outside of the routine and
confines of comfort, then

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:41.910
we're able to accomplish goals
and dreams that we previously

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:45.360
thought were not possible.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:49.860
We are going to open this up
to questions, after we show

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.246
some photos of our friends.

00:30:52.246 --> 00:30:55.320
KATY PRATT: Unless, do you want
to do questions first, Mark?

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.702
OK, any questions for us?

00:30:57.702 --> 00:30:58.910
CLAYTON PRATT: From the back.

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:00.500
KATY PRATT: One sec, we'll
just get a microphone.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:01.000
Sure.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:01.880
CLAYTON PRATT: Sure.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.520
AUDIENCE: You guys
are so awesome.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:04.989
KATY PRATT: Oh, thank you.

00:31:04.989 --> 00:31:06.155
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:31:06.155 --> 00:31:09.720
Was there a period of training
in preparation for the trip?

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.080
Are you guys avid bicyclists?

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.821
How did this all happen?

00:31:13.821 --> 00:31:15.862
Were you always comfortable
with these crazy days

00:31:15.862 --> 00:31:18.330
of miles and miles of bicycling?

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:21.480
CLAYTON PRATT: Katy got
appendicitis six weeks

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.420
before we left, and her
training was sub-par.

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:26.196
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:26.196 --> 00:31:27.570
KATY PRATT:
According to Clayton.

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:31.260
So we are both cyclists, but we
didn't do a crazy training plan

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.260
before hand.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.140
A lot of bike tourers
say that you kind of

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:37.295
build up endurance
right at the beginning.

00:31:37.295 --> 00:31:40.365
We were really exhausted at the
beginning, and kind of slowly

00:31:40.365 --> 00:31:42.807
got our cycling legs.

00:31:42.807 --> 00:31:45.390
CLAYTON PRATT: I told Katy that
she needed to be able to cycle

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:49.990
100 miles within seven
hours before we left.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:52.360
She got pretty close.

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.680
After two weeks, you're
just in good shape.

00:32:01.655 --> 00:32:03.030
AUDIENCE: Thank
you guys so much,

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:04.863
this is actually very
similar to something I

00:32:04.863 --> 00:32:06.450
want to do while I'm in my 20s.

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.439
KATY PRATT: Good for you.

00:32:08.439 --> 00:32:10.230
AUDIENCE: And I came
in a few minutes late,

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:12.021
so I apologize if you
covered this already.

00:32:12.021 --> 00:32:13.700
But over the
conversations you guys

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:17.980
had with your friends,
managers, very close people

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:21.093
right before leading up
to this trip, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:32:21.093 --> 00:32:22.676
KATY PRATT: So,
first, Clayton thought

00:32:22.676 --> 00:32:25.180
it would be a good idea if we
didn't tell any of our family,

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.280
and we just sent
them post cards,

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.240
which was not going to happen.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.905
But at first, we actually
didn't tell everyone right

00:32:33.905 --> 00:32:35.280
at the beginning,
just because we

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.220
didn't want to be
the people that

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.750
almost went on a bike trip.

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:41.130
So we actually started working
on things, to see like, OK,

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:45.000
could we make us happen, before
we then told our families.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.060
And we told our families
on New Year's Eve.

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:49.550
We were trying to get them
to ask us what our New Year's

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:50.490
resolutions were.

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:53.467
And then Clayton went off
with this, this is our plan.

00:32:53.467 --> 00:32:54.800
And they thought we were joking.

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.130
And we weren't.

00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:58.980
So that's kind of
how we started.

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:02.790
CLAYTON PRATT: There were really
just two big logistical things,

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:05.429
would Michigan let
me leave for a year?

00:33:05.429 --> 00:33:06.970
So I just sat down
with my counselor,

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:10.110
and she said, take one
year of personal leave.

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:12.500
And I said, sure.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:17.880
And then Katy talked to
Google, and having a job

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:21.600
held for greater than six
months proved to be difficult.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.973
But she was told, re-apply
when you come back.

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:32.910
It kind of came down
to-- the conversation

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:36.790
that we had amongst
ourselves was, we're young,

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:39.772
we're in good shape, we
don't have a child yet.

00:33:39.772 --> 00:33:41.672
One's on the way now.

00:33:41.672 --> 00:33:43.977
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:52.920
We kind of said, if
this doesn't happen now,

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:57.630
then it might
happen in 30 years.

00:33:57.630 --> 00:33:59.350
But it's either we do
this in six months,

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:01.470
or we talk about
it for 30 years.

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:03.950
So we kind of just jumped on
it, and everything kind of

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:04.706
fell into place.

00:34:08.357 --> 00:34:09.690
AUDIENCE: Well, congratulations.

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:10.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.492
KATY PRATT: Thank you.

00:34:12.492 --> 00:34:15.250
AUDIENCE: Can you talk a little
bit about safety on the bike?

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:17.210
I saw one photo, and I
didn't see any helmets.

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:19.195
So maybe some war
stores, or [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:19.195 --> 00:34:19.949
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:21.460
KATY PRATT: Good question.

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:28.600
CLAYTON PRATT: When we
got to Leeds, England,

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.739
third night of our trip,
I took off my helmet

00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:37.320
and buckled it to the
back of our bicycle,

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.281
and I never put it on again.

00:34:39.281 --> 00:34:41.060
KATY PRATT: I wore
mine much longer.

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:41.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:44.540
CLAYTON PRATT: Katy
wore hers longer.

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:47.260
What we found was
that cycling was

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:51.250
scary in one type of country.

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:53.340
In first world
countries, cycling

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:57.077
is a recreational activity,
and there's bike lanes,

00:34:57.077 --> 00:34:58.910
and people are used to
cyclists on the road.

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:00.160
That was fine.

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:03.760
In third world countries
people are still

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.400
riding bicycles because
that's how they get around.

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.940
And so we were just one of many.

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.247
We thought India
would be the scariest.

00:35:11.247 --> 00:35:13.330
And although there was a
lot going on on the road,

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:15.560
and we had to pay
much attention,

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:18.880
the fear of being hit by a
semi going 70 miles an hour

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.360
never happened,
because nobody in India

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.630
can go 70 miles an hour.

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:25.390
There's just too much
other stuff on the road.

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:29.800
Where things were a little
bit dangerous, kind of scary,

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.240
where Katy and I thought,
we've got to get off this road,

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.780
I would say it would be
like, Serbia, Hungary,

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:40.570
maybe the second
world, Eastern Europe.

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:43.050
Because people are starting
to get driver's licenses,

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:44.080
and they have to
have good roads,

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.746
and they're driving
really, really fast,

00:35:45.746 --> 00:35:49.460
and nobody in those
countries rides bicycles.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:54.000
As far as accidents,
we had zero.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.540
We tipped over, I would
say, somewhere in England,

00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:59.460
when we were on a
very, very small road,

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:01.300
going about three miles an hour.

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.230
And this car pulled up
like right next to us,

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:05.280
and I kind of braced us.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.130
But then the car went
past, and we tipped over.

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:10.960
KATY PRATT: This was the
first time I dropped my phone.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.133
It subsequently broke
on the whole trip.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:25.000
AUDIENCE: Hey, so the
bike itself is probably

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.540
worth thousands,
and you probably

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:29.460
had thousands of dollars
worth of gear on the bike.

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:31.350
Is that something you
had to worry about,

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:34.050
as you're traveling
around, like at night?

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:37.884
Just leaving it outside the
tent, or going to restaurants,

00:36:37.884 --> 00:36:38.800
having that out there?

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.800
Because I'm sure it stuck
out like a sore thumb,

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.920
in some locations.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.860
Was that a concern?

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:47.243
KATY PRATT: It definitely
was, and I think, at first,

00:36:47.243 --> 00:36:50.290
when it was shiny, shiny,
new, it was a bigger concern.

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:53.640
Now it's kind of banged up
a little bit, which is good.

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.320
At the beginning we started
hanging our dirty laundry

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.490
on it, like, oh, no one
will even come near it,

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:01.282
if our dirty laundry is on it.

00:37:01.282 --> 00:37:02.490
But yeah, that was a concern.

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:06.390
We did have a bike lock, to
attach it to things, as well

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:09.290
as the front wheel.

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:12.130
But, kind of slowly,
as our trip went on,

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:13.980
we just kind of kept
the bike around us.

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:15.690
I mean, obviously, if
it had been stolen,

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:17.820
it would have been
a pretty big issue.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:22.520
So we were very careful and
aware of it, but it was never--

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.725
Most nights we brought
the bicycle inside.

00:37:24.725 --> 00:37:26.960
If a hostel said, you
can't bring your bike in,

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:31.160
we just said, all right, we're
going to a different hostel.

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.620
The fear of it being
stolen, I would say,

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:38.420
would be the greatest in
urban Western Europe cities,

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.990
where there was some
sort of resale value.

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:44.039
As soon as we got
east of Turkey,

00:37:44.039 --> 00:37:46.330
no one was going to steal
it, because there was nothing

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:47.670
they could do with it.

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:51.220
If a little kid in
Laos steals our bike,

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:53.135
everybody knows it's not his.

00:37:53.135 --> 00:37:56.280
KATY PRATT: There was
only one red double cycle.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:59.470
Which is how everyone said,
double cycle, double cycle.

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:00.970
CLAYTON PRATT: The
interesting story

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:02.560
is that in India,
sometimes you wouldn't

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.059
be able to bring
it up to your room,

00:38:04.059 --> 00:38:05.500
but you could put
it in the lobby.

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.910
And for weeks, Katy
and I would wake up

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:09.830
at like 5 in the
morning, and we'd

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:12.507
hear people playing
with our bell.

00:38:12.507 --> 00:38:14.840
And it was reassuring, because
our bike was still there.

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:19.380
But it was like, great, you're
playing with our bicycle.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:22.199
There was kind of this, what's
ours is yours mentality.

00:38:22.199 --> 00:38:23.740
And then we'd go
down in the morning,

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.590
and they'd show us
pictures of, like, they'd

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:28.650
been riding our bike
around, taking pictures.

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:31.380
And it's like, it still works.

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:37.364 --> 00:38:41.110
AUDIENCE: Hi, so is there
some sort of synchronization

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:43.000
for riding a tandem bike?

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.265
And, also, as a follow
up to that, did you

00:38:46.265 --> 00:38:49.760
guys ever switch orders?

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.110
KATY PRATT: So, synchronization.

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:52.651
There's what's called
a timing chain.

00:38:52.651 --> 00:38:54.560
They do make tandems
that are not in sync,

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:56.800
but ours is in sync.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:00.560
So we did have to pedal in sync
if our pedals were synchronized

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.410
on the timing chain.

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:06.620
We tried it being out of sync,
but it was a little weird.

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:10.400
So when we bought our tandem, at
the tandem shop, here in town,

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:13.050
he asked us, have you ever
ridden a tandem before?

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:17.560
And we actually had, this
is our second tandem.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.470
He said, I will not let people
buy tandems if they've never

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:21.250
ridden a tandem.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:23.602
Because people think
it's like a great idea,

00:39:23.602 --> 00:39:24.560
to go on a tandem bike.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.643
Oh, it sounds so romantic.

00:39:25.643 --> 00:39:27.020
But it's actually very hard.

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:29.077
And, I mean, its
great being together,

00:39:29.077 --> 00:39:30.660
you arrive at the
same time, but there

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:33.790
are lots of cons with
riding a tandem, too.

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:36.614
So, we were in sync.

00:39:36.614 --> 00:39:38.280
CLAYTON PRATT: If one
of us is pedaling,

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.580
the other person
has to be pedaling.

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:42.020
So the biggest
arguments were over

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:44.437
cadence-- how fast to pedal.

00:39:44.437 --> 00:39:46.270
KATY PRATT: Or if we
were actually pedaling.

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:48.390
CLAYTON PRATT: How hard
of a gear to be in.

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:50.556
KATY PRATT: And then to
answer your second question,

00:39:50.556 --> 00:39:53.340
Clayton mostly rode in front.

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:54.640
Mostly-- always.

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:56.770 --> 00:40:00.220
CLAYTON PRATT: There was one
day, where we were in Utah,

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:02.530
we had just kind of gotten
through some sandy roads,

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:05.400
and it became too hard to cycle
with both of us on the bike,

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:09.462
so one of us would cycle
while the other one would run.

00:40:09.462 --> 00:40:10.420
KATY PRATT: Along side.

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:11.940
CLAYTON PRATT: One
night, I did the cycling,

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:13.180
and Katy did the running.

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:16.920
In the morning, Katy did the
cycling, I did the running.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:20.920
When we finally got to a paved
road, I hopped on the back,

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:24.350
and I was there
for about an hour.

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:26.139
KATY PRATT: He
couldn't handle it.

00:40:26.139 --> 00:40:27.680
So the front is
actually really hard,

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.825
because you have-- I mean,
those front two bags.

00:40:29.825 --> 00:40:32.450
Right now they're pretty light,
they just have clothes in them.

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:35.060
But they had sizable
amounts of weight on them.

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:37.150
So turning the tandem and
maneuvering the tandem

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:40.540
is actually very
difficult and heavy.

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:44.009
Plus, he really likes
the chaos, and being

00:40:44.009 --> 00:40:45.050
on the front of the bike.

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:46.870
And I actually love
being on the back.

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:49.909
I saw so much more than he
ever saw on our whole trip.

00:40:49.909 --> 00:40:52.450
We'd get somewhere, and I'd be
like, did you see x, y, and z?

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:54.116
He was like, what are
you talking about?

00:40:54.116 --> 00:40:57.660
I saw pothole, pothole, pothole,
white line, yellow line.

00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:59.270
So it was actually great.

00:41:04.642 --> 00:41:05.600
FACILITATOR: All right.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.290
CLAYTON PRATT: Slide show?

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:07.748
FACILITATOR: So
maybe what we'll do

00:41:07.748 --> 00:41:11.070
is wrap up the Q&amp;A and this
part of the presentation.

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:13.000
And then for those
that can stay,

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.820
there's a slide show, here.

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.320
And we'll just enjoy
the slide show,

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:19.480
and thank Katy and Clayton
for being here today.

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.287
Give them a round of applause.

00:41:21.287 --> 00:41:23.622
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.030
KATY PRATT: Thank
you, good audience.
