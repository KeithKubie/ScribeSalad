00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Sounds like the system is getting better there.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Now, my understanding is this rat's
nest of computers is also gone.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Right. So in the process of
moving to Cassandra,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the system for the precomputed queries became
--a lot more of them were mutated in place.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What the app will do when say, you remove
something from your saved links

00:00:29.123 --> 00:00:33.000
it has to be taken out of your saved page.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.646
Is it will fetch from Cassandra the
precomputed list of your saved page,

00:00:37.646 --> 00:00:42.000
remove the item from it that you didn't want anymore,
and then put it back into Cassandra,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and it has to lock around that.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
But the advantage there is it doesn't
have to just re-run the entire query

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.538
because it will only making one little change.

00:00:50.538 --> 00:00:54.000
So, instead of sending this
complex query to a machine

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that's already doing a lots of complex queries,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You just smartly update the--. &gt;&gt;Right. &gt;&gt;
The ultimate product of this is a cache.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Yes. &gt;&gt;So you just update the cache directly?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Right. There are a few types of queries
that that's not possible with

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and those are things like your top links of this hour.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So this all goes away? &gt;&gt;Yes.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Yes. I'm just going to make this go away.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We do still use "Q." &gt;&gt;We still have a "Q".
&gt;&gt;But not for this stuff. &gt;&gt;Okay.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The top links of this hour that kind of stuff instead

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
is recomputed enmasse for the
entire site using MapReduce,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and what that does is it will dump every link
that was submitted in the last hour

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.200
and it like groups them up and
figures out where they should go

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.000
and them just completely overwrites
those listings every 10-15 minutes.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We haven't talked about MapReduce yet.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The first question I have for you is the data that you're mapping over, where is that stored?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
It's coming out of Postgres.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So you have a job that takes that out of Postgres
and then runs the big job on it? &gt;&gt;Right.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Now, is this the same set of machines
that you would use for--

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
We have one slave for links dedicated.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Okay. So, there's like another little replica
that is only read for dumps.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.107
Yeah. &gt;&gt;Now, what about the comments
and votes in these other guys?

00:02:15.107 --> 00:02:19.000
There is no actual queries that need that.
&gt;&gt;Ah. Good point, good point.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
There is this special links thing and then
you run MapReduce jobs on this

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
ever so often and than that
get stored in Cassandra.
