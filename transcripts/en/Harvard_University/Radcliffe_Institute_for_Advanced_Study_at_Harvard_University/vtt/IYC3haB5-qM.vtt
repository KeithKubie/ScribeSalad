00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.430
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.420
- Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.430
Glad to have you here.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.180
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.820
I'm dean of the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.760
And I'm delighted to welcome
you to today's lecture

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.720
by Jacob Hacker, the Stanley
B. Resor professor of Political

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.760
Science at Yale.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.350
At Radcliffe, as
many of you know,

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.670
we bring together scholars,
scientists, and artists

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.620
to work on the cutting
edges of their fields

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.590
and across disciplinary
boundaries.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.810
And then we are
dedicated to sharing

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.890
the fruits of that advance work
with broad public audiences

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.710
in person and online.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.520
As an historian and dean
here at this institute,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.800
I believe strongly
in our mission

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.100
to bring leading scholars
and artists to Radcliffe Yard

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.710
to carry out advanced work.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.940
But I have been reminded of that
mission's importance even more

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.026
keenly over the last month.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.080
In the wake of one of
the most contentious

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.410
presidential elections
in my memory,

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.950
I heard and saw many
people looking for help

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.840
in making sense of the campaign,
the results, and the reality

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.510
of our very divided nation.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.010
Radcliffe's twin commitments to
supporting incisive scholarship

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.700
on critical issues, like the
state of American politics,

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.850
and then engaging the public in
serious discussion and debate,

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.580
seem more urgent than ever.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.810
So I am very pleased that
Jacob Hacker and all of you

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.180
are here with us today.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.680
As pundits have scrambled to
explain the victory of Donald

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.060
Trump, one common analysis
has emphasized resentment

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.760
on the part of Americans who
feel that the globalizing

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.850
economy has left them behind.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.940
For example, the Portland
Press Herald in Maine

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.420
interviewed an 80-year-old
retired mill worker

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.480
who had never voted for
a Republican before,

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.760
but who voted for
Trump this time,

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.030
and said, in his words,
"Because Democrats used

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.590
to be for the working class.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.390
I don't feel that anymore."

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.740
End quote.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.700
There is good reason for many
Americans like this mill worker

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.130
to believe they
are losing ground.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.150
Although the overall economy has
been thriving in recent years,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.880
and total wealth
production is up,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.600
economic inequality
has also been rising.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.690
The Economic Policy Institute,
a nonpartisan research

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.560
organization, reports
that since the 1970s,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.780
real wages for the top
1% have risen 362%.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.610
Meanwhile, real wages for
most workers have stagnated.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.230
And for many, they
have actually fallen.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.710
The result is increased
wealth concentration

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.920
on the very highest rungs
of the economic ladder

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.820
with a shrinking share left
over for everyone else.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:06.330
In 2014, the wealthiest 20% of
Americans owned more than 80%

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.370
of all American wealth.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.490
In contrast, the wealth
of the poorest 20%

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.110
was negative, meaning that their
debts exceeded the value of all

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.790
of their assets.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.640
Things have not
always been this way.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.370
In the decades
following World War II,

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.160
wealth in the United
States grew and inequality

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.570
shrunk at the same time.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.960
So what we are
seeing now represents

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.360
a fundamental change.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.610
Analysts across the
political spectrum

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.130
agree that it is a
worrisome change.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.130
Even a conservative
like Alan Greenspan,

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.900
former chair of the
Federal Reserve,

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.130
appointed by President
Ronald Reagan,

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.310
calls the current
levels of inequality,

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.860
and I quote him, "not
the type of thing

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.150
which a democratic society, a
capitalist, democratic society,

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.770
can really accept
without addressing."

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.200
End quote.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.750
Scholars of diverse
political persuasions

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.120
are asking related questions.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.110
Where is the dramatic increase
in inequality coming from?

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.800
Why is an economy that is
producing more wealth than ever

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.990
leaving people behind?

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.019
What roles have government
and private markets

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.350
played in creating
economic inequality?

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.100
And what can, and should,
they do to reduce it?

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.630
More specifically, is government
the cause or the remedy

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.640
for our present ills?

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.640
Critics differ, of course,
in their explanations

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.090
of how we got here
and what can be done.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.280
Jacob Hacker is a
political scientist

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.010
who has dedicated
much of his career

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.680
to investigating
just these questions

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.440
and to seeking greater
understanding of how

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.410
political and economic
leaders of different political

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.690
perspectives have answered them.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.470
At the same time, he has
developed his own analyses

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.800
about the causes,
consequences, and cures

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.170
for the current American crisis.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.970
No subject could be more
relevant or important today.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.670
In addition to teaching
at Yale, Professor Hacker

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.940
is the director of the Institute
for Social and Policy Studies

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.720
there, and he is also a
frequent media commentator.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.530
Professor hacker is the author
or co-author of five books,

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.800
including Winner-Take-All
Politics-- How Washington Made

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.400
the Rich Richer-- And Turned
Its Back on the Middle Class,

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.230
which was a New York
Times Best Seller in 2010.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.470
He co-wrote that book with
Paul Pearson, who is also

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.190
the the co-author on the book
that Professor Hacker will talk

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.210
to us about today, which is
entitled American Amnesia-- How

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.090
the War on Government
Led Us to Forget What

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.830
Made America Prosper.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.010
And if this lecture wets
your appetite for more,

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.740
let me tell you that there
will be a segment on tonight's

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.610
PBS NewsHour on
American amnesia,

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.380
and it will also
be live-streamed

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.660
if you don't catch it tonight.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.740
So please join me now in warmly
welcoming Professor Jacob

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.240
Hacker.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.685
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:10.661 --> 00:06:11.610
- Well, thank you.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:12.120
Thank you.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.500
It's such a pleasure to be here.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.420
Thank you, Liz, for
the introduction.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.080
I want to thank both the
Beckys, Rebecca and Becky,

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.200
for helping make it possible
for me to be here today,

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.560
Alex for the AV work she did.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.670
Hopefully, it will work.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.128
She said if it doesn't, shes
going to come running up here,

00:06:29.128 --> 00:06:31.230
so you'll all get to meet her.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:36.150
This is a setting that I'm
really happy to be back in.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.500
I was a student at Harvard.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.580
Spent also time here at the
Harvard Society of Fellows.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.790
When I was, I met many
of the great scholars who

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:49.030
are in the audience today, and I
consider them friends, mentors.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:54.220
And now, I'm fortunate to think
of them as colleagues, as well.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.710
So as Liz said, this
is a moment for us

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.860
to talk about what
I see as a crisis.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.560
And it's not just a
crisis of inequality.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.240
It's a crisis of
American governance.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.960
And it's not-- I also want to
emphasize a new development.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.970
And so, up front,
I just want to say

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.630
that I see Donald Trump's
victory, and the Republicans

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:20.270
broader victory, not as a
sharp break with the past,

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.040
but as a culmination of
some fundamental trends

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.170
in American politics
and policy that I want

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.230
to talk with you about tonight.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.850
I also just want
to say how pleased

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:33.480
I am to be able to
be here at Radcliffe.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.960
I was a student when
Radcliffe was still

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.650
a separate institution, though
moving towards this new status.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:45.030
My wife, Oona Hathaway has
both Radcliffe and Harvard

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:45.930
on her diploma.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:49.260
We graduated together in 1994.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.100
And one of the things I'm
going to be talking about today

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:57.180
is the degree to
which the active state

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:01.050
in the mid-20th century
increased our prosperity, not

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.740
by redistributing, not by taking
from some and giving to others,

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.140
but by opening up
opportunities that

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:11.970
made our economy vastly more
productive, as well as vastly

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:12.900
more fair.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.150
And that, I think, is really
symbolized by the role

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.130
that Radcliffe has
played, historically,

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.360
and continues to play today.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.760
And I'm honored to be
able to be a small part

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.130
of that institution.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.110
So I've already said
a lot of thanks,

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.700
and I want to keep them brief.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.730
I would really like to
be able to have a larger

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.680
conversation at the end.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.250
Whenever I'm in the
position of needing

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.140
to keep my remarks
short, I'm reminded

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:40.710
of an evaluation I received when
I was a new assistant professor

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.287
at Yale some years ago.

00:08:42.287 --> 00:08:43.620
And it began with great promise.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:48.270
It said, "Professor Hacker, if
I had just 15 minutes to live,

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:51.417
I'd want to spend
it in your class."

00:08:51.417 --> 00:08:54.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.162
"Because that way, it
would seem like an hour."

00:08:57.162 --> 00:09:00.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.950
So I hope the next 35
minutes or so of me

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:08.010
speaking seems pretty
close to the actual time.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:11.280
But I do an offer
one more thanks.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.440
Liz mentioned my
co-author Paul Pierson.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.720
He was a professor
here, knows many

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.860
of the same friends and
colleagues I was talking about.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.430
And he's really been just
a wonderful companion

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.970
on a now long
intellectual journey.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:31.070
And I know he would love to
be here giving this talk,

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.610
but he's a professor
at UC Berkeley,

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:36.020
so he actually has to teach.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.260
OK.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:43.290
So this book, American Amnesia,
was published a few months ago.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:48.240
And it's fair to say
that I didn't expect

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.270
Donald Trump to overshadow
it quite the way

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.060
he did there's an old
joke in publishing

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.730
that the period before
a book is published

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.244
is the calm before the calm.

00:09:59.244 --> 00:10:00.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:05.610
But this period has
been anything but calm.

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:11.010
And although it was frustrating
to try to talk about what some

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.680
of the longer-term trends in
American politics at a time

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.640
of fixation, on an outsized
personality, in a lot of ways,

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.320
I think the book is more
important than it was

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.960
when we first formulated it.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.200
And so what I want
to do is start

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.660
by talking a little bit about
what the argument of the book

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.680
is.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.920
And then I want to
turn, more broadly,

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.690
to its implications
for our understanding

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:39.270
of contemporary
American politics.

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.842
Now this picture on
the cover-- and I

00:10:41.842 --> 00:10:43.800
don't know how many of
you saw the picture that

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.810
was up previously, that was sort
of the poster for this talk.

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.012
It's really a wonderful picture.

00:10:51.012 --> 00:10:52.470
And it was actually
an illustration

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:55.679
that was done by the person who
does the public relations here

00:10:55.679 --> 00:10:56.220
at Radcliffe.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:57.930
But this picture-- yes, exactly.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.150
It's a great-- sort
of has a Hopper feel.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:05.280
But this picture, American
Amnesia, a lot of people

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.810
have said, well,
what a great cover.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.060
How did you get that how did
you get that Photoshopped

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.850
with that wonderful fog
there around the Capitol.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:15.210
Well, the reality is,
it is not Photoshopped.

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:18.400
This is the actual Capitol.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.350
And that, next to the Capitol,
is the Capitol Power Plant.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.960
It is, or was, until
it was decommissioned

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.200
in 2009, the largest
single source of carbon

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.270
emissions in the DC area.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:34.620
And it was spewing
coal ash out into one

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.310
of the most disadvantaged
neighborhoods in Washington DC.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:43.860
Well, fortunately, it was
taken offline in 2009.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.430
Unfortunately, this issue
was raised for 30 years

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:48.090
before that.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:51.760
And it was not until 2009
that it was taken down.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.910
And the reason, as
you might guess,

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.400
is that the senators
from coal states

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:01.470
were very much opposed to the
symbolic act of taking away

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:05.630
this great monument
to American energy.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:11.250
And that's, in some ways, a very
nice metaphor for the argument

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.930
of this book as a whole.

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.820
So it's not just Washington DC.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:22.680
If you go back to any
city-- this is Boston, 1969.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:27.030
The quality of air--
not to mention air,

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.600
as well as water, at the
time, was abysmal, right?

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:35.130
So this is Boston, 1969.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:39.750
I have pictures of Manhattan
and Detroit and Los Angeles.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.210
These cities were deadly.

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:46.950
The level of pollution
was such that when

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:50.000
bad air events, as they
were sometimes called,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.150
happened, literally,
hundreds of people would die,

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.370
and sometimes thousands.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:03.660
And the fact that we don't
have such polluted air today

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.210
is a reflection of
wise policy that

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:07.590
was taken around this time.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.690
In the early 1970s,
the Clean Air Act

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:12.600
was passed under a Republican
president, Richard Nixon.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.940
And that act, and the
subsequent amendments including,

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:21.390
the 1991 amendments
under George H.W. Bush,

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:25.200
dramatically improved the
quality of air in our cities.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.767
And we know that this has
made an enormous difference.

00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:30.600
And we know it from
looking at another city.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:36.300
This city is not
American; it's Beijing.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.990
And by comparing deaths
in rural parts of China

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:42.810
and deaths in Beijing,
it's possible to back out

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.710
rough estimates of how much life
expectancy in the United States

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:50.130
has been improved because of
this massive improvement in air

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.420
quality.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.360
And these were reported
recently in the New York Times.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.180
And I adapt that chart.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.430
And you can see that the
numbers are truly staggering.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:04.920
So a child born today,
as opposed to the 1970s,

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.860
could expect, in one
city in West Virginia,

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:11.000
to live for more than
five years longer

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.190
than his or her
counterpart in the 1970s.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:19.251
And the average for the United
States is around two years.

00:14:19.251 --> 00:14:21.000
But as you can see,
there are these cities

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.320
that are doing much better.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:28.170
And I'm particularly
interested in the second one

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:31.860
down because-- as Theda Skocpol
here in the audience knows.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:36.780
She's been studying these
two men quite a bit lately.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.914
This is the home
of Koch industries

00:14:38.914 --> 00:14:40.830
and Charles and David
Koch who, of course, are

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:44.070
leading critics of
active government,

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.440
and in particular,
environmental laws.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.680
But apparently,
being against laws

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.930
does not deprive you of
the extra years of life you

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.960
get from improved air quality.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:59.790
And these examples tell us,
I think, two basic things.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:04.290
One is that government's
regulatory and spending

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:07.740
powers, the power of government
to make people do things,

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:12.460
can sometimes be used for
enormous positive good.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.670
And the reason is,
second, because government

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:17.040
has distinctive capacities.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.732
Government, as I said,
has the ability--

00:15:19.732 --> 00:15:21.630
and Jane Mansbridge
has put this well--

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:24.870
to exercise legitimate
coercion, right?

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:27.060
Through our
democratic processes,

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.570
we decide how to use
government to overcome

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:33.000
various kinds of
collective action problems

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.070
and other failures of individual
decentralized behavior

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:43.650
that would otherwise make us
poor or hurt us in other ways.

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:46.440
I have been searching for
a way to describe this.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.750
The phrase that Paul
and I use in the book

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:52.260
is "the mixed economy," but
that's not very evocative.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.710
So in our search,
Paul remembered

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:58.590
that one of his advisors,
Charles Lindblom at Yale,

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:02.280
had talked about the
mixed economy as a hand.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.650
You have the nimble fingers
of the market, right?

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:09.907
They're very capable of
moving quickly and adjusting.

00:16:09.907 --> 00:16:11.490
And, of course, there
are four of them

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:13.540
doing lots of different things.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.110
But the other part of your
hand that's very useful

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:17.330
is you're thumb, right?

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.100
The strong phone that
can provide the counter

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.660
pressure that you need.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:25.717
And while you wouldn't want
to be all thumbs-- that

00:16:25.717 --> 00:16:27.300
would be pretty
awkward-- you wouldn't

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.790
want to be all fingers either.

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:33.540
It's the fact that they can
both work together, sometimes

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.850
in opposition and
sometimes in cooperation,

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:42.330
that allows us to do all the
great things that modern humans

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.310
do with their opposable thumbs.

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:47.490
And that metaphor, I
think, really sums up

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:51.060
our view, that this is
not a zero-sum conflict

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.820
between markets and
government, but rather

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.890
a positive-sum bargain
that involves, of course,

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:58.490
an enormous amount of
conflict and pressure,

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:04.069
but also an enormous amount
of positive-sum cooperation

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:06.810
and interplay.

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:11.210
And what's even more important,
and what I want to emphasize,

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:15.150
is that our nation's political
leaders once understood this.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.490
Understood this perhaps
not in the way that I've

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:22.050
just articulated, but were
very clear that you needed

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:27.500
an active, energetic, and yes,
sometimes coercive government

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.890
to achieve prosperity.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:30.900
Our founders understood it.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.460
The greats of America of
economics like Adam Smith

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.480
understood it.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.020
And our leaders of
the 20th century,

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.770
in particular, when American
prosperity was built,

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:41.400
definitely understood it.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:47.060
Today, as I'm afraid is
quite clear in the weeks

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:50.910
since the election, many of our
leaders do not understand this.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:55.970
And this forgetting,
active and inadvertent,

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:59.400
is what I want to talk
about today, this amnesia.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.470
So as I said, the
two things that I

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:05.310
want to emphasize in discussing
the argument of the book

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:07.680
is, first, that this
is a culmination

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.200
of long-term trends.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.930
And second, and this
is equally important,

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:15.770
that we need to have
a mixed economy.

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:19.490
We need to have fingers and
thumbs working together, today,

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:20.940
perhaps more than ever.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:25.950
And I believe we can
rebuild a mixed economy,

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:28.720
a new kind of mixed economy,
for the 21st century.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.560
So I want to talk
about why I still

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:35.430
have hope for that at
the end of this talk.

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:42.620
So let's take ourselves
back in time, say,

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:50.410
to the beginning of the
post-- to 0 AD, basically.

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:50.910
Right?

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:52.920
So this is a long time frame.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.420
And fortunately,
because of the work

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.530
of Angus Maddison and
his collaborators,

00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:00.060
we now have a pretty good idea
of what standards of living

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:04.940
were in some countries-- in this
case, of the United Kingdom;

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:09.840
and starting later, the US--
for very long periods of time.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.700
And if you look at
these figures, what

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.690
is really striking is that
the line was essentially flat

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:19.010
for most of modern
human history.

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:24.390
That jump occurs in the late
19th, early 20th century.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:25.850
And it's dramatic, right?

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:32.750
The degree to which we went
from being poor, very unhealthy,

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:36.390
as I'll show in a moment,
and very badly educated,

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:41.510
to being rich, healthy,
and very well-educated,

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:46.140
is almost impossible
to overstate.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:51.200
And this was not a natural
market development.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.510
Perhaps most important
in it was the development

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.990
of the capacities and
skills of workers.

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:59.880
And the public sector was
deeply involved in this.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:04.280
I'm often struck, when you hear
talk about where growth comes

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.940
from, that the group that
gets most of the attention

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:12.980
is the people at the top, the
job creators, as we're told.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.740
But if you look at why the
United States is so much more

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:20.544
prosperous than other countries,
and why it got so much more

00:20:20.544 --> 00:20:21.960
prosperous, it's
really the degree

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.410
to which mass workers
were able to become

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:29.540
much more capable and productive
that drove this development.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.480
And that had a lot
to do with education.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:37.170
So it is not the case that,
as Eric Cantor put it,

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:42.006
on Labor Day we should be
celebrating the businesses.

00:20:45.375 --> 00:20:47.750
Because of course, everyone
knows Labor Day was set aside

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:52.570
to honor entrepreneurs.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.600
It is that we should really
be understanding the insight

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.960
that Claudia Goldin and
Lawrence Katz provided us

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.480
with in showing us that the
United States was really

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.050
the pioneer in the
development of education.

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:07.280
And Theda, of course,
Theda Skocpol's

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.440
written very well about the
degree to which this continued.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.860
We went from being
mass universal K

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.260
through 12 education,
the first country

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.980
with universal high schools,
and then, of course,

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:22.080
a world leader in college,
thanks in large part

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.090
to the GI bill.

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:25.170
And that continues
well into the 1970s

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:29.910
with massive investments in
higher education, especially

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:32.600
state universities.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.820
So that is one
part of this story,

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.600
and it's probably the
most important part.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.200
Another part is the advancement
of science and technology,

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.800
which is tied up with
this development.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.820
And as far back as
Thomas Jefferson,

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.310
people understood that there
was a real market failure when

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:51.270
it came to creating the
kind of public knowledge,

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:57.470
like technology and
techniques like calculus,

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:03.080
that underpin our modern
knowledge-intensive economy.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.160
And you can really
see the American role

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.160
in this but looking
at Nobel prizes.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.340
So starting in the
mid-20th century,

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.380
and particularly during
and after World War II,

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:15.120
the United States came
to essentially own

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.520
the field in the
Nobel Prize area.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.050
And they owned the field
because they owned the field

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:24.180
in investment and research
and development science

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:24.805
and technology.

00:22:24.805 --> 00:22:27.200
It didn't hurt, of course,
that lots of Europeans

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.541
were also fleeing fascist
Europe and coming to the United

00:22:30.541 --> 00:22:31.040
States.

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.220
But we really continued that
because of the investments

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.470
we made in research
and development.

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:39.300
And just to give you a
sense of just how huge

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:42.470
this was, at the
end of World War II,

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:44.780
the United States
federal government

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.060
was spending more on
research and development

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.490
than all businesses and
governments in the rest

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:52.010
of the world combined.

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:54.590
And we've, unfortunately,
fallen quite a bit,

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:56.251
as we have in other areas.

00:22:56.251 --> 00:22:56.750
OK.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.916
So the last thing I
want to emphasize,

00:22:58.916 --> 00:23:00.290
and I've already
touched on this,

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:04.620
is that this was not a zero-sum
story, that growth was not

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.170
something where one group
was really giving up

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.690
a lot to let others prosper.

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:13.410
Of course, I'm not downplaying
the role of class conflict

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:14.850
and redistribution
in the history

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:17.430
of American economic
development.

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:21.740
But if you go back
to, say, the 1920s,

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:25.010
and look at the graduating class
of the Harvard Business School,

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.930
you will see that a lot
of potential in society

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.910
is not being tacked here.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:34.310
All the diversity
here is facial hair.

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:39.500
And so one of the things
that both the opening up

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:43.200
of education to
women and minorities

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.140
and job opportunities
did was vastly

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.470
increase the capacity
of the American society

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:52.220
to draw on these
dispersed talents.

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.770
There was a recent
study that estimated

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:59.190
that about a fifth of total
economic growth in the United

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:04.440
States between 1960 and 2000
was due simply to increased

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.930
opportunities in the
labor market for women

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:09.800
and minorities.

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.450
So I said that this wasn't
just about income but also

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:13.140
about health.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.010
And here, I think there's an
equally dramatic statistic

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:16.920
we can look at.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.920
And indeed, in this case, we
could go back, but not quite as

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.770
far, to the 1500s.

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:26.500
But as you'll see, the story is
just as dramatic if we do that.

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:30.150
So the first thing to say is
that life expectancy did not

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:34.540
start to rise dramatically until
the 19th century, and really

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:37.626
the late 19th and
early 20th centuries.

00:24:37.626 --> 00:24:39.500
And again, we're looking
at the United States

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:43.620
when it sort of enters the
picture in the 19th century.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:48.320
But the other thing to
say is the spikes here,

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:53.640
which are not wars, but
major diseases and plagues

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:58.520
and famines, and the
fact is that if you look,

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.650
the people who lived in,
say, British Victorian era

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:04.410
did not have much longer life
expectancies than people who

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:07.070
lived in, say, ancient Greece.

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:09.390
And that's a pretty
remarkable fact.

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:11.870
It's really the
20th century when

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:15.560
we see these massive
increases in life expectancy

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.430
and all of these other
measures of health:

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:23.940
declining infant mortality,
increased ability in older age,

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:24.600
and so on.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:28.890
And this, again, was not some
kind of natural development,

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:31.560
as I think it's often seen.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:35.820
For example, the big spike
that occurs early on here

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.670
is due almost entirely to
declines in infant mortality.

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:40.924
And that, in turn, is
due almost entirely

00:25:40.924 --> 00:25:42.840
to public health efforts
that are taking place

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:43.631
at the local level.

00:25:43.631 --> 00:25:45.300
I just read a really
fascinating article

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:48.630
that shows not only that these
public health efforts were

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:51.870
highly important in
improving life expectancy,

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:56.196
but that they were driven by the
mobilization of women's groups

00:25:56.196 --> 00:25:58.320
in these areas, a kind of
continuation of the story

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.260
that Theda Skocpol tells in
her book Protecting Soldiers

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.420
and Mothers, about
mothers pensions.

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.510
So there was a political
story behind this.

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:09.300
It was a story of enlarged
participation by women.

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.750
It was a story of
greater responsiveness

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:16.934
of local and state and national
elites to ordinary citizens.

00:26:16.934 --> 00:26:19.350
But it resulted-- in there
was, of course, the development

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:21.270
of science, the germ
theory of disease,

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:24.260
which postdates the early
public health efforts, but is

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:27.540
at the heart of a lot of
the later work that's done.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.670
And so this goes
to the expansion

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:32.160
of insurance and
medical technology

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.890
and clinical practice, right?

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:40.680
The great divide that we cross
in the early 20th century

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.550
is not just one of
income and health.

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:47.990
It's also a shift
from being worse off

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:50.270
if we saw a doctor
to being better off.

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:53.250
So there's a great
quote from one

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.440
of the presidents
of Harvard, where

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.730
he says a random patient
seeing a random doctor

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:02.400
for random condition did
not, until this period,

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:07.560
have more than a 50/50 chance of
benefiting from the encounter.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.560
Now, it's not 100% today,
but it's a lot better.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.940
And this wasn't the only thing.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.170
It wasn't just medical care.

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:14.510
It wasn't just insurance.

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:18.020
It was also an
enormous expansion

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:21.570
of things that are protecting
people against themselves.

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.170
And this, I know, is a
hard subject to take up.

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:28.010
It reeks a little
bit of paternalism.

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:37.230
But the fact is that the decline
in smoking and the improvement

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:39.740
in auto safety, which often
involves requiring people

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.330
to have safety measures,
was also enormously

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:46.460
important in this story.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:50.981
So this is the smoking picture.

00:27:50.981 --> 00:27:51.480
Right?

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.360
So the Surgeon General's report
and the anti-smoking efforts

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.910
of this period make an
enormous difference.

00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:03.030
Just recently, there
was some controversy

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:07.110
over that concussion
scandals within the NFL.

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:10.735
And the New York Times
revealed that the NFL

00:28:10.735 --> 00:28:12.360
had been using some
of the same lawyers

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.940
that the tobacco
industry used, which

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:18.910
led to the following
quote from the NFL.

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:23.070
My colleague, Paul Pearson, says
when the NFL says you're bad,

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:23.966
you're really bad.

00:28:23.966 --> 00:28:24.466
OK.

00:28:24.466 --> 00:28:25.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.680
And this is the same
story with lead,

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.560
which the decline of lead
in our-- the decline of lead

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.490
in our cities, which
improves cognitive function,

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:37.700
is probably implicated
in the decline in crime.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.790
When we talk about
Flint, we say oh my god.

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:43.460
And it is just a
horrible regression.

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:48.570
But the fact is
that in the 1970s,

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:51.510
large portions of preschool
kids had lead levels

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:54.770
much higher than those
that we see in Flint.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:56.910
For example, a lot
of people think

00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:00.690
that 5 micrograms per deciliter
is kind of the upper limit

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:04.680
that you should be exposed to.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.020
And as you can see, in
the mid-'70s, your average

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:11.291
preschool kid was exposed to
something like five times that.

00:29:11.291 --> 00:29:11.790
OK.

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:17.760
So this is the
story of how we got

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.520
so much richer and healthier.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.620
So what is the story of
how this came undone?

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:24.290
Because it has come undone.

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:27.180
In area after area that we
write about in the book,

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:30.200
we are no longer
leading the pack.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:34.690
The example that I
find, in some ways--

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:37.320
and I'm just going to skip over
this-- but the example that I

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.680
find, in some ways,
most revealing

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.180
is that Americans used to be
the tallest people in the world

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.980
by a very large margin.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:47.240
We were much taller at the
time of the revolution.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:50.910
We were taller
than the Europeans

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:52.984
at the time of World War II.

00:29:52.984 --> 00:29:54.900
But we're not the tallest
people in the world,

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:56.670
and this is true
even if you look

00:29:56.670 --> 00:30:00.690
at people who are
native-born white Americans.

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:03.570
So this is the US trend,
and these are basically

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:05.470
cohorts when you're born.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:06.930
Here is the Netherlands.

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:08.820
My wife's family is
from the Netherlands.

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:12.020
Whenever I go over there, I
realized just how short I am.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:15.290
And you can see, well, there's
your average Dutch build

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:18.870
and your average American build,
and there is a difference.

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:22.520
Germans have done a
little better-- a little

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:23.790
less well than the Dutch.

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:25.620
But in general,
basically, we have

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:28.890
ceased to be this kind
of towering people

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:31.700
at the same time as we've fallen
behind on these other measures.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:32.200
OK.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:37.860
So I very briefly want to say a
bit about what underscored this

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.560
and how it fell apart.

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:42.570
And the crucial point
that I want to make

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:45.960
is that there was a political
and economic coalition

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.750
of business leaders and
moderate Republicans that

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:51.450
was at the heart of the
success of the mixed economy.

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:54.930
In some ways, you can tell the
story of the transformation

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:58.470
from one Romney to another.

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:01.050
From George Romney, the
Governor of Michigan,

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:04.940
who was an auto
manufacturer, to Mitt Romney,

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:08.910
the-- we all know
who Mitt Romney is.

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:10.470
I can move more
quickly than that.

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:14.400
So what is the nature
of this transformation?

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.680
After all, they're both
Republicans in blue states.

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:20.430
They're both relatively moderate
within their own parties.

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:23.630
And they both have a private
sector business experience.

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:26.730
Well, one of the most
fundamental differences

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:30.270
is that George Romney comes
from the manufacturing world.

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:33.120
And he himself is
very clear that there

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.820
needs to be a great deal of
equity within the workplace.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.830
And he's supportive of unions.

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:41.160
At the same time,
George Romney is opposed

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.780
to the Goldwater conservatism.

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:46.380
And at the time-- so if
you think of Mitt Romney,

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:49.710
he's coming out of
the finance world,

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:52.050
the world of Bain
Capital, which is

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:55.230
much more about slicing
and dicing companies

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:57.690
and about shorter-term
economic gains.

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:01.980
So if you think about these two
figures as business leaders,

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.560
as we discussed in the
book, the transformation

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.560
of the business community,
both the organizations that

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:12.180
represent it and business
leaders' own orientation

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.680
toward the mixed
economy are really

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:16.800
transformed over this
period by financialization

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:20.800
and by changes in organized
business leadership.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.250
So this man, Tom
Donohue, is the head

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:24.690
of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:26.940
The Chamber of Commerce,
under his leadership,

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:29.760
has gone from being kind of
a staid, moderate business

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.880
organization to being closely
allied with Republicans

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.800
and much more of a lobbying shop
for parochial private sector

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:36.300
interest.

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:41.480
This, after all, is what the
sign on Tom Donohue's desk

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.350
reads, "Show me the money."

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:47.070
And as Theda Skocpol has
very carefully shown,

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:48.810
the other major
business group that

00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:51.840
has become much more
powerful, besides the Chamber

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.490
of Commerce, is
the Koch network.

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:56.410
And the Koch network
is, of course,

00:32:56.410 --> 00:33:00.420
is not so much
parochial in this way.

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.770
But it's very extreme,
ideologically.

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:05.130
And it's probably
roughly equal in size

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:06.930
or even larger to the
Chamber of Commerce.

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:09.750
Now, one feature
of this development

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:12.510
that I want to emphasize is that
it takes us back, in a sense,

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:15.100
to an older, more
feudal economy.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:17.130
And this is the Rhine River.

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:18.930
These are the
castles on the Rhine

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:21.630
that the robber barons,
as they were called,

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:26.310
used to basically block
commerce and take tolls,

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:31.255
thus shutting down European
trade in the 1500s.

00:33:31.255 --> 00:33:36.150
And in many ways, today's
business associations

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:39.480
and top corporate leaders are
much more operating in a world

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:43.590
where they're able to use
market power and political power

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:44.950
to skim off the top.

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:49.455
As Liz was talking about
before, the rise in inequality

00:33:49.455 --> 00:33:52.080
is driven, in substantial part,
by what's happening at the top.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.610
And there's more
and more evidence

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:57.330
that this is about, in
many cases, rent-seeking.

00:33:57.330 --> 00:34:00.120
That is, above market
returns that are

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.510
a result of political power.

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:03.750
So for example, in
our health care sector

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:08.409
where we spend vastly
more than other countries,

00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:11.969
we're spending much more
for mediocre results.

00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:16.679
There's enormous evidence
that the lobbying activities

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:21.659
and market power of private
actors from providers

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:24.330
to pharmaceutical
manufacturers is

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:26.870
at the heart of the
degree to which we--

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:28.679
that our costs are so high.

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:31.409
And those costs, of course, are
enormous reason for the squeeze

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:33.659
on other parts of our budget.

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:36.270
The other big change
that is reflected

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:41.760
in this transformation
is a transformation

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.860
of the ideology of
the Republican Party.

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:46.284
So if the business world has
become more financialized

00:34:46.284 --> 00:34:47.659
and has organized
representatives

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:51.929
to become either more
mercenary or more extreme,

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:54.247
the Republican Party has
become much more conservative.

00:34:54.247 --> 00:34:55.830
And I don't think
this is particularly

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:57.690
controversial at this point.

00:34:57.690 --> 00:35:01.570
But I just want to make clear
that part of this conservatism,

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:05.340
it goes hand-in-hand
with some solicitousness

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:06.930
towards these
corporate interests.

00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:09.450
But it's also an
anti-government ideology

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:12.690
that is quite explicit
about seeing government

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:15.450
as the problem, as
Ronald Reagan put it.

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:18.720
And more than that, the
strategies of this movement

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.300
have been much more
focused around obstruction

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:23.500
and making it difficult
for government to act.

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:27.250
So in a lot of
ways, the strategies

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:30.930
of, first, Newt Gingrich
and Mitch McConnell

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:34.200
have basically been fomenting
anti-government sentiment,

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.652
in part by making it
very difficult to govern.

00:35:36.652 --> 00:35:37.860
You see this again and again.

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:40.230
And what is particularly
important to understand here

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:43.950
is that the mixed economy
rested heavily on the ability

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:46.640
to form moderate
bipartisan compromises.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:50.940
And as late as the early 1990s,
you still saw those forming.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:55.050
But this twin move of
the Republican Party

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:58.680
toward both a more conservative
ideology and a more

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.990
obstructionist stance
has made it much harder

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:03.130
to use government
in a positive way.

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:07.530
Now, in my conclusion, I want
to talk just a little bit

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:10.140
about the current leadership.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.870
And I just want to say let
the record show that I've

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:16.080
spoken for about 50 minutes
and have really not mentioned

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:16.980
Donald Trump yet.

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:20.010
So that's quite an
achievement, I think.

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:22.410
And in fact, I want to talk
not about Donald Trump first.

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:25.080
I want to mention Paul Ryan.

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:33.210
So Paul Ryan is--
if you look at this,

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:34.680
these are from
D-NOMINATE scores,

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.450
so ignore this dimension.

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:37.570
Just think about this.

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:41.910
This is a dimension that goes
towards more conservatism.

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:44.340
Ryan is quite a bit more
conservative than Boehner.

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:46.740
Boehner, by the way, was on
the right edge of his party

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.460
when he came into Congress.

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:51.740
And, of course, he
then became, first,

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:53.580
a the kind of centrist
within his own party,

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.890
and then actually
fairly moderate

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:58.480
relative to these Freedom
Caucus members, who

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.150
are the most conservative wing.

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:03.160
Ryan is much more
comfortably within that.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:07.650
And put aside his
expressed enthusiasm

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:10.260
for the writings of Ayn Rand.

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.900
If you look at the Ryan
budgets that have come out year

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:15.570
after year, they have involved
three central elements,

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:19.440
massive tax cuts that are not
really funded in the future

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:23.370
and thus will devastate
the federal budget,

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:25.920
disproportionate--
where the cuts are made,

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:30.660
disproportionate cuts for
the poor, and finally,

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:33.990
dismantling of key core parts
of the social insurance state,

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:37.770
notably the movement of Medicare
away from a guaranteed benefit

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:41.820
towards a voucher that it
will, over time, erode relative

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.360
to the cost of medical care.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:46.920
There is no sign that Paul
Ryan has changed his view

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.220
on these fundamental issues.

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:50.070
In fact, before the
election, in a moment

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:52.167
that was kind of missed
by many commentators,

00:37:52.167 --> 00:37:54.750
Paul Ryan got up there and said
here's what we're going to do.

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:55.770
We're going to
pass all this stuff

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:57.228
through the
reconciliation process.

00:37:57.228 --> 00:37:59.071
If we have a
Republican president,

00:37:59.071 --> 00:38:00.570
that's the budget
process that can't

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:02.130
be subject to a filibuster.

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:05.130
If we had a Republican
president, he'll sign it.

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:08.670
Well, now they do, and I
think he will-- certainly,

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:12.342
on many of the proposals that
fall short of the restructuring

00:38:12.342 --> 00:38:14.800
of Medicare, which is where I
think there would be the most

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.010
pushback.

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:18.870
But the other
thing I want to say

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:21.330
about the continuation
of these trends

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:23.550
with the contemporary
Republican Congress

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:26.250
is that the other key
figure is Mitch McConnell.

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:29.070
Mitch McConnell, in my view,
and as we argue in the book,

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:31.740
has sort of cracked the
code of American politics.

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:34.080
He realized that in
our political system,

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:38.040
it was possible
to foment distrust

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:39.630
in American political
institutions.

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:41.790
And the levels of
distrust that we see today

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:42.930
are truly remarkable.

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:43.440
Right?

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.930
We've never seen
public trust so low.

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:48.480
And I really think we
should not go too deeply

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.090
in trying to understand
some of the core elements

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:52.860
of this election.

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:55.470
There was dissatisfaction
with many aspects

00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:57.090
of where our country is going.

00:38:57.090 --> 00:39:00.986
The party in power had been in
power already for eight years.

00:39:00.986 --> 00:39:02.610
And people don't
believe in government.

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:04.235
They've been pressing
the "mad as hell"

00:39:04.235 --> 00:39:07.476
button every few elections,
and things have not

00:39:07.476 --> 00:39:09.600
been getting better, and
they're mad as hell again.

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:12.880
Now, the coalition behind
that was different.

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.646
And the response,
unfortunately, I think,

00:39:14.646 --> 00:39:16.020
will be quite
different than what

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:19.980
many of those pressing the
"mad as hell" button want.

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:23.290
But I think it's very much a
continuation of these trends.

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:27.360
So in my last
remarks, I just want

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:32.190
to say a little bit about why
I think we should, nonetheless,

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:34.800
believe that there is
prospect for a mixed

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.980
economy for the 21st century.

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:41.190
And at the end of the book,
Paul and I say there's good news

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:42.065
and there's bad news.

00:39:42.065 --> 00:39:44.231
And since I've been talking
about a lot of bad news,

00:39:44.231 --> 00:39:45.640
I'll start with the good news.

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:48.630
And the good news is that there
is a lot of money on the table.

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:53.070
There are a lot of positive-sum
bargains we're not making.

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:55.620
Perhaps, we will
seize on some of them.

00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:58.860
I am very doubtful about the
Trump infrastructure proposals.

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:00.480
But that's certainly
an area in which

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.490
we've massively
been underperforming

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:04.040
because of lack of investment.

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:06.375
So, unfortunately--
I say unfortunately

00:40:06.375 --> 00:40:08.250
because I think that
the Trump infrastructure

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:10.320
proposals, as they've
shaped up, look

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:13.230
very much like privatization
of public assets

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:16.810
with little positive
long-term benefit.

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:20.640
But the truth is that there
are many areas in health,

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:24.270
in economic inequality
and security,

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:27.040
in infrastructure and research
and development, where

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.560
we have not been making the
investments that we should.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:34.680
And if we did, we would witness
significant economic growth,

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:37.770
and it would be broadly shared.

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:39.079
So that's the good news.

00:40:39.079 --> 00:40:40.870
And I also think another
piece of good news

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:42.790
is that I think it's
completely compatible

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:46.560
with our broad
political institutions

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.810
to achieve that goal.

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:52.230
But the bad news is that
it's going to be hard.

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:54.970
And that's what--
it's not something

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:56.200
that people want to hear.

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.230
There is no magic bullet.

00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:00.460
We're not going to reverse
these trends simply

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:04.955
by reducing lobbying or
eliminating Citizens United.

00:41:04.955 --> 00:41:06.580
We're going to have
to do three things.

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:10.210
And they're as difficult as
they are easy to articulate.

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:13.600
First, we have to get government
moving again and working.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.750
If it doesn't work,
then this doom cycle,

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:19.650
this doom loop of dysfunction
we've been seeing, continues.

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:23.350
Second, we have to
increase mass pressure

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:24.820
on elite organizations.

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:28.240
And labor unions are facing
a mass extinction event.

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.480
Where will that
pressure come from?

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:33.250
We need to think about that,
and we need to be part of that.

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:38.620
And finally, we have to
encourage cross pressure

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:39.520
among elites.

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:44.640
We need Silicon Valley
standing up and speaking out

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:48.520
for the degree to which the
political economy that we need

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.394
to create for the
21st century for it

00:41:50.394 --> 00:41:51.810
to be a thriving
knowledge economy

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:55.890
is threatened by
these developments.

00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:57.776
It's a huge issue,
and it was really

00:41:57.776 --> 00:41:58.900
in this election we saw it.

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:02.740
Prosperity is increasingly
concentrated in urban knowledge

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:05.080
centers where these
agglomeration effects created

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:07.660
by technology are greatest.

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:10.890
And that prosperity has
not been shared broadly.

00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:13.270
It is the future of our
economy, but it's a future

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:15.660
that all Americans
need to be part of.

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:19.330
So we have the
grounds for growth,

00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:21.960
and we know what the
basic formula is.

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:24.280
And I actually think that
given what I've just said,

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.520
there's a very large prospect
that the current political

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:30.580
regime will overreach
and create opportunities

00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:33.000
for that kind of building
of a long-term movement

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.440
for effective governance.

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.660
But it's not going to
happen unless we recognize

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:40.810
how deep the problem is and
how fundamental the role

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:44.080
of government is in
creating our prosperity.

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:47.040
Or as Paul Pierson and I put
it at the end of our book quite

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:50.200
succinctly, "The government
that governs best

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.140
has to govern quite a bit."

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:53.250
Thank you.

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:56.428
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:04.570
- Hi.

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:05.540
I'm Ann Withorn.

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:08.460
I was a professor at UMass
Boston and done a lot of work

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:13.150
on welfare, poverty,
social movements.

00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:15.880
And I think what you
said is very important,

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:17.590
and there's nothing
bad about it.

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:18.960
It's actually good.

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:21.360
But I'm missing some things.

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:26.650
I'm missing race, racism,
racial differences organizing

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:30.150
around race, and then race
in a global perspective.

00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:32.130
We are the British
empire, which is

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:37.570
losing in it's sense
of global racial power.

00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:40.570
And I think some of
this stuff is connected

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:41.790
to that in different ways.

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:42.904
Its ideology.

00:43:42.904 --> 00:43:43.445
Its identity.

00:43:43.445 --> 00:43:44.210
It's all those things.

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:45.900
But you didn't really
talk about that.

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:50.590
And that, to me, is something
you could talk about.

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:51.549
- Yes, I totally agree.

00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:53.340
- And I'm sure you
probably do in the book.

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.270
I haven't read what
you've been doing lately.

00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:56.940
But that's important.

00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:00.420
And I think that to
give a talk like this

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:03.040
to an audience that's
maybe a little tougher

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:07.930
than this audience might be
and certainly darker, you

00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:10.690
need to be starting
out by saying

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:12.040
who's in those Cadillacs?

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.110
Where's that?

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:14.070
Where's the whiteness?

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:15.236
Where's is the black people?

00:44:15.236 --> 00:44:16.620
Where's the color?

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:19.990
Otherwise, you sound like you
don't care and don't know.

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:22.249
I actually sound--
I think you do.

00:44:22.249 --> 00:44:24.040
I don't have any reason
to think you don't.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.590
But it's, right
now, not the time

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:27.690
to have people assume that.

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:29.880
You've got to show that, man.

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.630
Or people will just
write you off or think

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:34.210
you're just one more cover up.

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:34.840
OK.

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:38.230
Quickly, the second thing
is back in the '80s here

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:41.140
in Massachusetts, we get worried
at the early version of all

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:43.500
the private stuff, and we
had this wonderful little

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:48.750
newsletter called The Privateer
News, which-- human services

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:51.421
types and some of the business
people-- because people

00:44:51.421 --> 00:44:52.920
worry about welfare
reform, and then

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.520
everybody getting
to the labor market.

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:56.710
It wasn't a really
radical organization.

00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:59.460
But it said what's happening
is that the Privateer's

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:00.070
are winning.

00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:03.330
Those are the same people
who brought us imperialism.

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:06.320
And the interesting
piece was that

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:09.570
at that point, what happened
was the business people who

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:12.610
were supposed to be
helping us ran for cover.

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:14.900
They didn't want us to
call it a Privateer News.

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:17.530
I know I got to shut up.

00:45:17.530 --> 00:45:24.790
But I think that talking very
directly and with moral suasion

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:27.910
about the-- it won't
happen unless people stop

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:29.860
saying private isn't better.

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:31.360
It can't just be another model.

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:32.401
And I'm going to shut up.

00:45:32.401 --> 00:45:33.080
I see you.

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:33.580
OK?

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:34.560
But it's--

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:39.940
- Well, I completely
take your first point.

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:46.720
And I must say that it's
always shocking to discover

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:50.080
how much slower you
are when you give

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:53.440
a talk than you were in your
mind when you were writing it.

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.420
So I actually did have
to omit a little bit

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:59.950
of a discussion of this
really important dimension.

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:03.280
Though, I also think it's
fair to say looking back

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.780
at the book, and I
recognized it at the time

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:08.336
we were finishing it up, that
it says much less about race

00:46:08.336 --> 00:46:08.960
than it should.

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:13.300
So let me say a little bit
about how I think that fits in.

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:16.690
So, first of all, one cannot
deny the degree to which

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:21.550
American politics has shifted
to onto a racial axis.

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:25.510
Or returned might be the
better way to put it.

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:31.100
And there is a lot of
writing in discussing

00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:34.390
this election about class
and differences of class.

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:38.350
And I think that there is some
evidence of a certain kind

00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:39.880
of class differences.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:43.120
Whites without a college
degree, definitely,

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.550
were much more strongly
Republican in this election

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:48.190
than they have been
in recent elections.

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:51.040
But that was a difference
in degree, not kind.

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:52.780
I think what was
really striking to me

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:56.170
was the degree to which
this election became

00:46:56.170 --> 00:46:59.680
much more explicitly
racialized than any one I've

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.570
seen in my lifetime.

00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:04.750
And the patterns of voting,
of course, reflected that.

00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:06.280
People, right
after the election,

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.440
were talking about
how Clinton just

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:10.210
didn't bring out
African-Americans

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:11.260
and Hispanics.

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:14.170
As I'm looking at these
numbers-- and the turnout

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:14.830
is one issue.

00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:17.389
But in terms of the
rates of support,

00:47:17.389 --> 00:47:19.430
especially among Hispanics,
it's just remarkable.

00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:22.480
It's quite clear they understood
what Donald Trump was saying

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:26.290
and the threat that he posed
to people with brown skin.

00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:29.710
So the way in which it fits
into our larger story, I think,

00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:31.280
is twofold.

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:36.010
One, we talk about, and another
we should have talked about.

00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:38.830
So one we talk about
is the way in which--

00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:43.060
this idea of the state as this
agent of redistribution, which

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:45.460
I think is very common
among both Liberals

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:46.710
and Conservatives.

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:49.690
It really misses the way in
which the government policies

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:51.610
create these kind of
positive-sum bargains.

00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:56.230
The degree to which bringing
African-Americans fully

00:47:56.230 --> 00:48:00.840
into our economy was
vastly wealth-producing

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:02.780
for the economy as a
whole, and of course,

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:08.380
for those who were able to,
for the first time, become

00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:12.250
a part of the American dream.

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:14.770
And at a time, of course,
where that dream was just

00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:17.100
about to hit the rocks.

00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:21.820
But the language of
redistribution on the right

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:23.800
is the language of
makers and takers.

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:27.820
And there's no question
that image, as lots of work

00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:30.760
has shown, is a
highly-racialized image.

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:33.130
So there's a reason that
Medicare and Social Security,

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:35.050
which are seen as
predominantly helping

00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:37.540
upstanding, hardworking,
white Americans

00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:45.160
are not viewed as part of this
miasma of welfare dependency.

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:46.930
And there's a reason
there's a reason

00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:52.990
as well that Donald
Trump and his supporters

00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:55.390
saw the campaign
around-- oriented

00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:58.027
the campaign around
immigration and the changing

00:48:58.027 --> 00:48:59.110
complexion of the country.

00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:02.620
And I think that we just cannot
understand that being the way

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:05.590
in which distrust of government
has risen in the United States

00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:07.960
without understanding that
it partly represents a very

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:11.380
fundamental backlash against
the changing demography

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:14.560
of our country and
the changes in status,

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.977
if not economic well-being
that that entails.

00:49:16.977 --> 00:49:19.060
This side of it that we
didn't say anything about,

00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:20.601
which I've gotten
more interested in,

00:49:20.601 --> 00:49:25.240
is we basically like
government, right?

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:28.840
We see it as distorted
in many ways.

00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:32.230
And the irony is that we think
that there's-- on the right,

00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:35.890
people talk, I think correctly,
about crony capitalism.

00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:39.714
And then they say the cure
is to essentially cut back,

00:49:39.714 --> 00:49:40.630
eliminate, government.

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:43.150
It's like a form
of bloodletting.

00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:45.040
If we crippled
government, then it

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:46.465
can't be used for
these purposes.

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:54.790
And so we're basically saying,
let's take back government

00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:58.240
for the positive purpose
that our founders understood,

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:01.090
Adam Smith understood, and the
leaders of the 20th century

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:01.860
understood.

00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:06.400
But there was a predatory
state, and its orientation

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:09.160
towards African-Americans
in particular

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:12.340
does not look this
benevolent at all.

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:15.670
Look at the Ferguson report
to see that in action.

00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:19.770
And I think that we, Paul
and I, in writing this book,

00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:21.790
really just did
ourselves a disservice

00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:23.422
by not thinking
more about how this

00:50:23.422 --> 00:50:24.630
fits into the larger picture.

00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:27.420
After all, this decline
in trust in government

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:30.400
and in the presence of the
state in a positive way

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:32.350
in our economy
occurs simultaneously

00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:34.900
with the rise of
mass incarceration

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:38.050
and the rise of these very
punitive and extractive

00:50:38.050 --> 00:50:40.350
practices that were revealed
in the Ferguson report.

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:43.254
So I plead guilty that we
didn't do more on that,

00:50:43.254 --> 00:50:45.170
and I'd love to get your
thoughts about how it

00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:46.900
could be better incorporated.

00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:48.540
Next question.

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:53.730
- Hi, I'm Jane Mansbridge, and
I teach at the Kennedy School.

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:57.070
I completely buy your
positive-sum story.

00:50:57.070 --> 00:50:59.670
Toward the end, you said
that a mixed economy

00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:04.030
depends on the ability to
make bipartisan compromises.

00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:04.690
- Yes.

00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:08.920
- And I'm wondering
what to do then?

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:12.607
Because there are
a large numbers--

00:51:12.607 --> 00:51:13.940
- It depends on unicorns, right?

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:17.560
- --three major structural
reasons why we're not going

00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:19.210
to get that.

00:51:19.210 --> 00:51:23.070
First of all, Johnson signed the
Civil Rights Act back in 1964.

00:51:23.070 --> 00:51:26.580
The Southern Conservatives
left the Democratic Party.

00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:29.560
Now, you've got two much
more homogeneous parties,

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:32.820
and they are acting like
homogeneous conflicting

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:33.320
parties.

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:34.361
They're not making deals.

00:51:34.361 --> 00:51:37.170
You can't find someone
across the aisle who

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:39.460
thinks the way you do anymore.

00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:42.250
And then two, as you
know, Nolan McCarty

00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:45.340
has got this
wonderful graph that

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:48.400
shows-- you all
know that inequality

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:49.920
has got this great U-curve.

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:53.100
It turns out that
polarization has got a U-curve

00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:55.800
that maps absolutely onto it.

00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:58.600
So there's a suggestion
that inequality--

00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:00.490
now he's gotten more
detailed, and he

00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:04.480
can begin to show that
inequality causes polarization

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:06.270
to some degree.

00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:09.652
Well, I don't see inequality
turning around tomorrow.

00:52:09.652 --> 00:52:11.110
That means that
polarization is not

00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:13.620
going to turn around either.

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:15.960
And then Frances Lee
has got this point,

00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:19.810
which he says that as elections
become more competitive,

00:52:19.810 --> 00:52:24.330
there's no reason for the party
that's the minority to go along

00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:25.750
the way they did
back in the days

00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:28.690
that we consider the
wonderful bipartisan days.

00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:32.710
They were really days
of Democratic dominance.

00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:34.710
And so if you were
Republican, it kind of

00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:37.960
payed you to not
be too obstreperous

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:40.370
because you weren't going to
get your roads and bridges.

00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:42.630
But as soon as you
think you've got

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:44.170
the eye on the
next election, you

00:52:44.170 --> 00:52:46.590
think you can actually make
it in the next election,

00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:49.750
then it's in your interest
to keep the party in power

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:51.250
from doing anything.

00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:53.400
Because then they're
run on their successes,

00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:56.340
if you can keep them from
doing anything, just the way

00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:57.690
you can then say, look--

00:52:57.690 --> 00:52:58.370
- OK.

00:52:58.370 --> 00:52:59.560
I got it, Jane.

00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:00.751
It's really bad.

00:53:00.751 --> 00:53:01.750
- So now, what do we do?

00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:03.990
That's my question.

00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:05.740
- So the first thing
to say is absolutely.

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:10.440
And one wonders if
bipartisan is the wrong word

00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:13.900
to use in this context,
given, as you say,

00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:18.600
the degree to which
the parties have become

00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:21.000
more homogeneous and distinct.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.460
it may well be that
what I am talking about,

00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:25.960
the kind of compromise, if you
will, that I'm talking about,

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:30.040
is much more about creating
effective majorities that

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:33.960
are representing broad middle
of the American electorate.

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:35.400
And that's not what we've had.

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:37.899
The way to understand-- and
this is not an original thought.

00:53:37.899 --> 00:53:40.500
This is contained in the work
of Thom Mann and Norm Ornstein

00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:42.810
and Theda's work and
others-- is that we basically

00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:45.870
are developing more unified
parties, although not unified

00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:47.482
always in the way
that we typically

00:53:47.482 --> 00:53:48.440
would think of parties.

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.980
The Republican
Party both has had

00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:53.620
in recent years has both been
highly unified in its voting

00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:55.290
patterns and highly
fractious as well,

00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:57.210
in terms of its
leadership choices.

00:53:57.210 --> 00:54:03.090
But we have unified parties of
a almost parliamentary style

00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:05.290
in a separation of power system.

00:54:05.290 --> 00:54:07.830
And if you go back to
the writing of Juan Linz

00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:09.544
and other theorists
of parliamentary

00:54:09.544 --> 00:54:10.960
versus presidential
system, that's

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:12.670
a really bad combination, right?

00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:14.440
It leads to instability.

00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:17.020
It leads to the potential
for a sort of authoritarian

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:20.560
to come to power, promising he
can break through the gridlock.

00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:23.040
I would never think
that could happen.

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:28.560
And it also is very hard to
hold parties accountable,

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:32.310
which is after all the
ideal of party government,

00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:34.956
was that one party is
in power, and based

00:54:34.956 --> 00:54:37.080
on the performance of the
economy and other things,

00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:38.913
you can decide whether
you should keep them.

00:54:38.913 --> 00:54:40.980
Are you better off than
you were four years ago?

00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:42.850
In our system,
who's in charge when

00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:46.442
the presidency is held by
one party and Congress,

00:54:46.442 --> 00:54:48.400
or one branch of Congress
is held by the other?

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:50.520
That is, as I say,
part of the reason why

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:53.350
the backlash against Republicans
could be quite consequential,

00:54:53.350 --> 00:54:56.160
because there is a much
more unified accountability

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.540
than there has been recently.

00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:02.070
So what does it require
to create more pressure

00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:06.440
for moderate outcomes,
which might be--

00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:09.540
and in irony, I think our book
is basically saying we need

00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:11.660
radical change to create
moderate outcomes,

00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:14.201
which I know is not a rallying
cry that many people are going

00:55:14.201 --> 00:55:15.080
to get behind.

00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:17.300
Well, I think the big
thing we shouldn't forget

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:20.690
is that, first of all,
pressure from the edges,

00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:24.800
and particularly in the US,
given the weakness of the left

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:29.450
relative to the organized right,
is an important part of pulling

00:55:29.450 --> 00:55:31.250
people to the center.

00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:35.160
A second thing I would
mention that I think

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:39.140
is very important and
somewhat neglected,

00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:42.290
is that I've never seen a
case in American history

00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:44.582
where elites just sort of
decide they're going to-- out

00:55:44.582 --> 00:55:46.414
of the goodness of their
heart, that they're

00:55:46.414 --> 00:55:49.250
going to come to some kind of
compromise that's positive-sum.

00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:51.140
It always happens
because of constraint.

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:53.480
The mid-century business
elite wasn't just

00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:57.170
the greatest generation
of business leaders.

00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:58.700
They had to face
organized labor.

00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:00.540
They had to deal with
moderate Republicans.

00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:02.120
So how do you create constraint?

00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:04.703
If it's not going to come from
labor, where does it come from?

00:56:04.703 --> 00:56:06.200
What kind of organizations?

00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:08.810
As a very important
starting point,

00:56:08.810 --> 00:56:10.496
you can't expect
it just-- you could

00:56:10.496 --> 00:56:12.620
have a strategy for winning
elections that involves

00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:14.300
being in just a few
places in the country

00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:16.200
because you have to
create ongoing constraint

00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:17.000
on governance.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.950
That means the
Democratic Party has

00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:21.060
to be a 50-state
party, as often said.

00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:24.200
It means the
organization on the left

00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:25.520
can't just be in Washington.

00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:26.040
Right?

00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:27.498
They have to be
federated, as Theda

00:56:27.498 --> 00:56:28.895
has argued in much of her work.

00:56:28.895 --> 00:56:33.342
Lastly, and I think kind of
cuts against the grain of some

00:56:33.342 --> 00:56:34.800
of the political
science consensus,

00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:35.930
but I want to say it.

00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:37.789
I think that our low
levels of turnout,

00:56:37.789 --> 00:56:39.830
and particularly the
disparities between mid-term

00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:42.200
and presidential election
years, is an enormous part

00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:43.370
of the problem here.

00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:46.170
And that to get
more people engaged

00:56:46.170 --> 00:56:48.920
in politics on a sustained
basis, not just voting,

00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:52.040
but as a gateway to other
forms of organization, voting,

00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:53.630
and especially in
midterm years, would

00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:55.670
make a tremendous difference.

00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:57.500
And it would make a
difference in part

00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:00.130
because it would create
much greater chance

00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:02.900
of the kind of accountability
that I was talking about,

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:05.632
not the-- essentially,
you get two years,

00:57:05.632 --> 00:57:07.590
and then the other party
is going to crush you.

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:09.200
And let's just be clear.

00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:11.060
There's an asymmetry
between the parties

00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:13.230
in how this system works
because the Republican

00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:16.340
Party has become the party of
low turnout election years.

00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:19.116
It's become the party
of older, whiter voters.

00:57:19.116 --> 00:57:21.240
That didn't used to be the
case-- and rural voters.

00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:22.770
That didn't used to be the case.

00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:25.700
Now, a democratic
presidency and Congress

00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:28.772
has two years before
midterm wipes it out.

00:57:28.772 --> 00:57:30.230
And with the
Republican party, they

00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:32.599
don't have that same conflict.

00:57:32.599 --> 00:57:34.640
And the only way we're
going to create a conflict

00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:38.170
is if there's high
turnout on both sides

00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:39.860
in non-president election years.

00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:41.830
Next question.

00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:44.900
- June Sekera with the Global
Development and Environment

00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:47.960
Institute at Tufts, and
where we have recently

00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:52.230
launched a project on
the public economy.

00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:53.570
- Wonderful.

00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:57.980
- Something that doesn't
exist in economics.

00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:04.130
And I actually spent 25 years
of my life or more in government

00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:06.840
at the federal, state, and
local levels in management

00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:08.370
and leadership positions.

00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:13.580
And I watched, basically, the
marketization of government

00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:14.450
at all three levels.

00:58:14.450 --> 00:58:18.840
It happened-- all three
levels as I worked at them.

00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:21.510
And what we have is a government
that's been taken over

00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:26.120
by the economic market model.

00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:31.340
And the religion, the
ideology of market economics

00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:34.640
is basically
permeated government

00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:43.230
and is the rationale by which
much of government is run.

00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:45.750
I read your book,
and I really want

00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:47.750
to say that I am very
appreciative that you talk

00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:51.860
about how redistribution--
how so many think

00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:54.480
of government as just-- a
major role is redistribution.

00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:56.500
It does very much more.

00:58:56.500 --> 00:59:00.320
But my question is, you talk
about the mixed economy.

00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:05.450
And that term, which
many people use,

00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:06.950
sort of leaves the
question hanging.

00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:10.310
A mix of market and what?

00:59:10.310 --> 00:59:14.960
And so what I have been
working on, and others,

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:18.950
and it's in my recent in my
recent book on The Public

00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:24.480
Economy in Crisis, is that
there are multiple economies.

00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:26.630
There's the market
economy, and there is

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:29.810
the public non-market economy.

00:59:29.810 --> 00:59:32.830
And we need a theory of the
public non-market economy,

00:59:32.830 --> 00:59:34.500
which we are working on.

00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:35.000
- Great.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.458
- But I wondered
if you had thought

00:59:36.458 --> 00:59:39.080
about that, the term
mixed economy, and also

00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:43.310
the question of the
thumb versus the fingers?

00:59:43.310 --> 00:59:45.560
The government is actually--
the public economy

00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:46.870
is actually a producer.

00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:49.910
Paul Studenski wrote
about this in the 1920s

00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:52.546
very eloquently as
government as a producer.

00:59:52.546 --> 00:59:54.420
So I wonder if you had
talked about that, you

00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:55.878
and your co-author,
and whether you

00:59:55.878 --> 00:59:59.450
had any thoughts about the
mixed economy versus there

00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:01.027
being a public economy?

01:00:01.027 --> 01:00:01.860
- Thank you so much.

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:04.270
Yeah, and I'm so glad that
this project is taking place.

01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:08.150
And I do think that--
as a very first gloss

01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:10.620
on what you were saying,
I think we definitely

01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:13.940
are not suggesting that a
mixed economy simply consists

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:15.880
of marketing government.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:16.380
Right?

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:21.484
There's a huge nonprofit
voluntary sector as well.

01:00:21.484 --> 01:00:23.150
And we shouldn't
forget the way in which

01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:27.870
the economy rests on the
quantity of households as well.

01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:30.000
So I agree with that.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.880
I think that this is the
best metaphor I've heard,

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:37.339
but it does have this
problem that it suggests

01:00:37.339 --> 01:00:38.880
that the role of
government is mostly

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.784
kind of pushing
back and regulatory,

01:00:40.784 --> 01:00:42.450
and that's not at all
what we're saying.

01:00:42.450 --> 01:00:43.650
A lot of what I
was talking about

01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:45.860
was kind of the fuel for
the engine of prosperity.

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:47.610
And in fact, the
big problem I see

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:51.000
is that we're not actually
replenishing that tank.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.570
And so we're going to be
running on fumes more and more.

01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:56.820
If we look at the digital
economy and the breakthroughs

01:00:56.820 --> 01:01:00.150
that resulted, there were
1950s and '60s investments.

01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:02.760
And where are we making
those investments today?

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:06.110
In some areas, but far too
little and far too late.

01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:11.630
So what I didn't say
about the productive side

01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:13.840
in marketization is-- and
if we could just pull up

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.860
this slide that I put up here.

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:21.060
So this is the chart that--
I just found it today--

01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:22.944
that sort of shows
why everything we

01:01:22.944 --> 01:01:25.110
think we know about the
federal government is wrong.

01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:26.400
So the federal
government is spending

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.524
a lot more than it used to.

01:01:27.524 --> 01:01:29.250
But in terms of
civilian employment,

01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:32.610
it's basically been
relying increasingly

01:01:32.610 --> 01:01:37.460
on third-party contractors
and privatization.

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:39.574
So this is total
civilian employment

01:01:39.574 --> 01:01:40.740
as a share of the workforce.

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:43.250
And I think we point out in
the book that to get back

01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:47.355
to the Eisenhower-level era
levels-- in John [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:47.355 --> 01:01:48.980
has pointed this
out-- you have to hire

01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:52.020
like two million federal
workers tomorrow.

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:54.254
And right now, Donald
Trump is proposing a freeze

01:01:54.254 --> 01:01:55.670
on federal hiring,
which continues

01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:57.960
a kind of Republican call.

01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.520
And what happens in the absence?

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.710
And we can see this too
in congressional committee

01:02:01.710 --> 01:02:04.800
staff, which as our society
grew much more complex,

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.214
and Congress's role in
legislating increased,

01:02:07.214 --> 01:02:09.380
there was this enormous
increase in committee staff.

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:11.630
This come from the
work of Lee Drutman.

01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:14.960
And in recent
decades, of course,

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:18.326
really centering around
the rise of Newt Gingrich

01:02:18.326 --> 01:02:19.950
and the Republican
capture of Congress,

01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:21.630
there's been a dramatic decline.

01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:24.000
And the result is at the
same time, of course,

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.300
there's just been
enormous outside spending.

01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:31.560
This is a world in which
the one side has essentially

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:34.190
weaponized, and the
other side is disarmed.

01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:37.940
And not having an effective
public sector in that context

01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:40.020
leads to precisely
these kind of dynamics.

01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:45.920
I think this, to me, is probably
the most likely evolution

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:48.270
of the American mixed
economy under Donald Trump.

01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:51.090
There's going to be this
kind of cut back right

01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:54.090
conservative move that will
be centered around Ryan.

01:02:54.090 --> 01:02:56.630
But to the extent that Trump
himself is putting his imprint

01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:59.400
on an economic
policy, I think it's

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:02.820
going to be much more around
these kinds of opportunities

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:07.090
for private profit
through public power.

01:03:07.090 --> 01:03:09.790
And some of it will
be his own profit.

01:03:09.790 --> 01:03:13.530
And there is times when
that actually can work.

01:03:13.530 --> 01:03:15.630
If you think about
the post-war era

01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:19.200
and what's sometimes called the
military complex, but really

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:22.620
was the military industrial
academic complex-- when

01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:28.380
you use decentralized means and
competition to, for example,

01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:32.580
design weapons systems or
to come up with new research

01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:34.700
and development ideas
or do basic science,

01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:36.810
it can work it can
work extremely well.

01:03:36.810 --> 01:03:39.210
But it's, note,
not an area where

01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:43.400
the profit motive is really the
fundamental source of pressure.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:45.650
And what we see in this
private predation--

01:03:45.650 --> 01:03:47.820
I mean state predation
I was talking about,

01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:49.466
is like what's
happened in Ferguson.

01:03:49.466 --> 01:03:51.090
It was all about
creating opportunities

01:03:51.090 --> 01:03:52.590
for the private
sector, essentially,

01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:56.670
to extract from citizens
who became essentially

01:03:56.670 --> 01:04:01.170
indebted to for-profit
industries that

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:03.441
preyed on them, thanks
to the opportunities

01:04:03.441 --> 01:04:04.440
that government created.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.910
And government was
collecting a few pennies

01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:07.620
on the dollar of this
private predation.

01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:11.310
So there is a way
in which we have

01:04:11.310 --> 01:04:14.550
to keep this metaphor in mind
because the thumb isn't just

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:16.500
about pushing back
in regulatory terms

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.430
or pushing for investment.

01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:21.060
It's also about disciplining
and holding back

01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:24.840
the power of market actors to
subvert the political process.

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:26.670
That is the
fundamental dialectic

01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:29.070
of democratic capitalism.

01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:33.990
And to me, if there is one
message that comes out of this,

01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:37.190
is that you need to have a
state that's strong enough

01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:42.380
to resist the inevitable
concentrations

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:46.380
of economic power that result
in a capitalist economy, which

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:48.320
is not an
anti-capitalist position.

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:50.920
It's essential for
making capitalism work.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.860
Yes, so next question.

01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:54.020
- Hi, my name is Lucas.

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:56.660
I'm just a citizen
of Massachusetts.

01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:57.470
- Just?

01:04:57.470 --> 01:04:59.090
No.

01:04:59.090 --> 01:04:59.900
That's great.

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:01.670
- So two things, I guess.

01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:04.560
One is, what's
driving this amnesia?

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:05.060
Right?

01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:06.740
Is it really just all politics?

01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:11.270
Is it a Republican strategy
to sow distrust in government?

01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:12.020
Is that really it?

01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:16.490
Or maybe the second component
is, what does media play?

01:05:16.490 --> 01:05:18.040
How does the media play a role?

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.930
I'm sure we've all heard
about the fake news epidemic

01:05:20.930 --> 01:05:23.240
and how that's been
sort of creating

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.130
echo chambers, especially
in social media

01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:30.230
among conservatives, just
not factual statements being

01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:32.990
promulgated across the internet
and being taken as truth,

01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:35.090
and how that factors
in in all of this.

01:05:35.090 --> 01:05:35.960
Thank you very much.

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:36.560
- Thank you.

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:37.170
Yeah.

01:05:37.170 --> 01:05:39.800
Well, so I want to be clear.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:41.780
One of the strange
things about this book

01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:43.460
is that Paul and I have
gotten a lot of pushback

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:45.418
from people who say that
we're too much focused

01:05:45.418 --> 01:05:48.020
on ideas, which is something
I've never been accused of.

01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:50.150
You just saw this whole
talk about organizations

01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:51.650
and political movements.

01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:55.070
But I do think there is a
cultural shift that we're

01:05:55.070 --> 01:06:01.110
talking about that is reflective
of the lead organization

01:06:01.110 --> 01:06:05.600
in investment and probably
is also reflective of broader

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:08.289
changes in our society that,
say, Daniel Rodgers writes

01:06:08.289 --> 01:06:09.830
about in his book
The Age of Fracture

01:06:09.830 --> 01:06:11.880
towards a greater
emphasis on individualism.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:14.750
But one thing I would
say is that that kind

01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:20.300
of individuation, a sense
of personal empowerment,

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:23.270
is compatible with a lot of
different and better models

01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:24.260
of capitalism.

01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:26.990
So it gets channeled into
this much, much more kind

01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:31.067
of dog-eat-dog limited
government ideology.

01:06:31.067 --> 01:06:32.900
So I just want to say
a word about the media

01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:34.970
because I think that's a really
interesting and important

01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:35.510
question.

01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:38.390
And in the book, we
talk a lot about the way

01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:43.700
in which Fox News and talk radio
really drove the increasing

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:45.800
intensification of the
Republican base, which

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:50.120
in turn, fed into the way in
which the GOP shifted right

01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:50.830
over time.

01:06:50.830 --> 01:06:53.570
And you really can't
overstate the role.

01:06:53.570 --> 01:06:55.940
It's not that Fox News is
convincing a lot of swing

01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:57.710
voters to vote for Republicans.

01:06:57.710 --> 01:06:59.450
There's a little
evidence that when

01:06:59.450 --> 01:07:01.190
it is introduced
into media markets,

01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:03.080
that it pulls
candidates to the right.

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:06.260
But the real story is the degree
to which it becomes a vehicle,

01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:08.370
and this was true in
the Tea Party's rise.

01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:11.540
A vehicle for
mobilizing and focusing

01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:14.990
the energy of
conservative activists

01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:18.410
and ordinary citizens who are
intense and willing to get out

01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:19.280
there.

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:22.060
The Tea Party was a
remarkable organization.

01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:25.280
And once again, I drew
a lot on Theda's work

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:26.450
in thinking about it.

01:07:26.450 --> 01:07:27.920
It's a remarkable
organization that

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:31.010
involved-- it is a
decentralized, federated

01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:34.700
organization that has
lots of mass input.

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:37.880
There is something there that we
should understand for building

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:38.810
broader organizations.

01:07:38.810 --> 01:07:40.352
But one piece of it
that is very hard

01:07:40.352 --> 01:07:42.476
to think about how you
would replicate it elsewhere

01:07:42.476 --> 01:07:45.020
is the way in which Fox News
and conservative talk radio

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:47.990
plays a kind of amplifying
role in that world.

01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:50.360
The mainstream media,
as we sometimes call it,

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:53.900
has really not done
us a very good job,

01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:58.290
to put it bluntly--
to put it mildly.

01:07:58.290 --> 01:08:01.800
So the two things that I
think about the media here.

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:05.300
One is that-- Dan
Rather was once

01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:07.930
asked what the goal of
the nightly news was,

01:08:07.930 --> 01:08:10.270
and he said to survive.

01:08:10.270 --> 01:08:10.770
right?

01:08:10.770 --> 01:08:12.410
They're under enormous
competitive pressure,

01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:13.326
and they're declining.

01:08:13.326 --> 01:08:15.800
Lots of people have tuned out
from the mainstream media.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.930
And the media is in a tailspin.

01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:19.479
In fact, to the
extent that it's been

01:08:19.479 --> 01:08:21.020
able to hold on in
recent years, it's

01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:24.500
by doing a kind of
conflict-oriented,

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:28.490
horse-race-oriented,
hyperventilation kind

01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:31.880
of coverage that doesn't
really inform people very much.

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:36.560
And that is-- I'm not
saying the media was once

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:37.964
like a civics lesson.

01:08:37.964 --> 01:08:39.380
But the degree to
which people are

01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:44.672
getting important information
about policy or other features

01:08:44.672 --> 01:08:46.880
of public affairs from the
media has really declined.

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:49.850
The other thing the media does
is reinforce this negative view

01:08:49.850 --> 01:08:50.439
of government.

01:08:50.439 --> 01:08:52.130
And there's a headline
you'll never see.

01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:54.386
It's, "Things are
getting better, slowly,

01:08:54.386 --> 01:08:55.510
because of the government."

01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:56.240
Right?

01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:58.515
It's just like your eyes
are already-- your eyelids

01:08:58.515 --> 01:08:59.390
are already drooping.

01:08:59.390 --> 01:09:01.520
But that's the truth
in a lot of areas.

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:04.520
We have looked at a lot of
studies of media coverage,

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.229
and the negativity
bias, particularly

01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:09.050
around public policy, is
really an important reason

01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:12.170
why people don't understand
some of the positive benefits

01:09:12.170 --> 01:09:13.010
of public policy.

01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:15.040
So I wouldn't put too
much emphasis on it,

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:17.540
but I do think, especially in
terms of ginning up the right,

01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:18.706
has been really fundamental.

01:09:18.706 --> 01:09:21.671
Thanks, Lucas.

01:09:21.671 --> 01:09:22.170
- Hi.

01:09:22.170 --> 01:09:23.569
My name is Jonathan [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:23.569 --> 01:09:25.302
I'm also a member of the public.

01:09:25.302 --> 01:09:27.260
First of all, thank you
very much for the talk.

01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:28.460
- Thanks, Jonathan.

01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:30.576
- So you mentioned at
some point in your talk.

01:09:30.576 --> 01:09:31.450
I think it was early.

01:09:31.450 --> 01:09:34.220
You said the institutions
we have are effective.

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:36.390
But you've obviously
talked about some problems.

01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:38.306
And we see them, like
gerrymandering, Citizens

01:09:38.306 --> 01:09:40.220
United, voter suppression.

01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:41.990
And you also said
Mitch McConnell solved

01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:43.520
the problem of governance.

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:48.439
So my question is,
are you convinced

01:09:48.439 --> 01:09:50.210
that maybe institutions--
and I'm even

01:09:50.210 --> 01:09:54.300
thinking in particular the
structure of the Constitution,

01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:55.730
not at a really
fundamental level.

01:09:55.730 --> 01:09:57.634
But are there any
amendments that are needed

01:09:57.634 --> 01:10:00.050
or changes that are needed to
address any of these issues?

01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:02.940
Do you think that, as we are
right now, if nothing changes,

01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:05.310
that things will in
fact be able to improve?

01:10:05.310 --> 01:10:06.070
- Well, thanks.

01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:06.570
Yes.

01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:08.660
So I hope that my
message that came across

01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:11.110
wasn't that our current
institutions are effective.

01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:18.170
My point was only that we could
achieve a better mixed economy

01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:21.320
without the kind of fundamental
constitutional reform that

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:23.990
sometimes gets held
up as the only path

01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:25.760
to economic redemption.

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:30.440
And in terms of McConnell, the
point I was making is simply

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:36.350
that McConnell realized that if
the Republican party was able

01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:40.190
to fail to cooperate-- one
way to think about this--

01:10:40.190 --> 01:10:42.620
I'm sorry to step back, but
one way to think about this

01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:48.090
is in a parliamentary
system, and at least

01:10:48.090 --> 01:10:50.930
in your idealized images,
if you're the opposition,

01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:52.010
you're not in government.

01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:52.820
Right?

01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:54.740
But what the Republicans
have been able to do

01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:57.020
is both be the loyal
opposition, thus

01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:59.000
reaping the reward
when governance is bad,

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.610
and also to make governance
nearly impossible.

01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:03.830
That combination is a toxic one.

01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:07.190
And so there are ways in which
we can make that less possible.

01:11:07.190 --> 01:11:09.650
They're not easy, and they
wouldn't necessarily--

01:11:09.650 --> 01:11:12.740
and I don't think they would
probably, from a standpoint,

01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:15.010
should involve
constitutional amendments.

01:11:15.010 --> 01:11:19.130
So for one thing, as
I said, is the degree

01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:21.299
to which you have two
electorates, mid-term

01:11:21.299 --> 01:11:23.090
and presidential election
year electorates.

01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:25.298
Not to mention, that filters
down to the state level.

01:11:25.298 --> 01:11:28.100
Most governors are elected not
in presidential election years.

01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:30.380
Where they are elected in
president election years,

01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:32.600
Democrats are much
more likely to win.

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:36.140
So it's actually, I think
would be quite helpful to think

01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:38.000
about, OK, well how
do you make midterms

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.560
and how do you make off-year
elections much higher turnout

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.260
affairs?

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:43.970
The other thing,
as I said, is a lot

01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:46.100
of this is about outside
organization and creation

01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:50.720
of constraint so that our
political system once-- it's

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:54.590
always required, and sometimes
it's facilitated compromise.

01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:56.480
And it's facilitated
compromise when

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.552
there's these sources
of outside constraints,

01:11:59.552 --> 01:12:01.010
as well as
cross-cutting cleavages.

01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:03.980
And so trying to create
that outside organizational

01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:05.610
constraint is important as well.

01:12:05.610 --> 01:12:06.770
One thing that I think
would really help,

01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:08.561
and I just don't know
exactly how to do it,

01:12:08.561 --> 01:12:11.030
is you've got to be able to
have some kind of mechanisms

01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:14.590
and some kind of fora for
calling out extremism.

01:12:14.590 --> 01:12:17.510
And let me just-- think
of that if-- would

01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:21.180
this election have
been different if--

01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:23.690
and because obviously,
the media said again

01:12:23.690 --> 01:12:26.000
and again, they're like this
is a reprehensible thing

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.722
that Donald Trump
has said or done.

01:12:27.722 --> 01:12:29.930
But would it have been
different if, instead of that,

01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:32.660
they had kept saying Donald
Trump is actually at odds

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:34.520
with the Republican party.

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:35.450
Now, he's not, right?

01:12:35.450 --> 01:12:38.210
Because he owns the
Republican Party, in a sense.

01:12:38.210 --> 01:12:38.840
He helped them.

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:40.760
And of course, he doesn't
own them in the sense

01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:42.440
that he's setting their
agenda-- Paul Ryan knows what

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:45.110
he wants to do-- but in a
sense that nothing succeeds

01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:46.320
like success.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.160
And they're much more likely to
be allied with him as a result.

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:52.310
But before the election, they
were playing a very, very

01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:54.830
delicate double game.

01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:57.660
And it was, I think,
greatly under-reported.

01:12:57.660 --> 01:12:59.627
And especially among
Republican voters,

01:12:59.627 --> 01:13:01.710
knowing the extent to which
there was this divorce

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:02.793
would have been important.

01:13:02.793 --> 01:13:04.850
And I think more generally,
the accountability

01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:07.160
can't happen unless people
have some basic idea

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:09.890
of what's happening
and who's responsible.

01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:13.965
So I think that that creating
that is a difficult challenge,

01:13:13.965 --> 01:13:16.340
but it's one that doesn't
require constitutional changes.

01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:20.270
If I had a couple
Constitutional amendments,

01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:23.990
I would be-- I think
the electoral college is

01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:25.502
an anachronism.

01:13:25.502 --> 01:13:27.710
I'm not a big fan of the
Senate, but that's basically

01:13:27.710 --> 01:13:29.930
beyond amendment.

01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:32.120
So we can talk
about these things.

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.880
But I actually
think that-- and it

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:38.664
would be nice to have PR in
some parts of the country,

01:13:38.664 --> 01:13:39.830
proportional representation.

01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:43.640
But really, the truth is
that in a lot of respects,

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:45.320
these are extra
institutional features.

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.986
And even if you believe
the institutions

01:13:46.986 --> 01:13:48.560
can be changed
fundamentally, which

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:50.910
I don't, that you could
address these problems

01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:51.824
without doing so.

01:13:57.810 --> 01:14:01.320
- Jonathan Martin, sociologist
from Framingham State

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:01.920
University.

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:05.355
I'm also a contributing editor
of the recent book Empowering

01:14:05.355 --> 01:14:06.980
Progressive Third
Parties in the United

01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:10.890
States, which was related to
the question I'm going to ask.

01:14:10.890 --> 01:14:13.650
So having read your book
Winner-Take-All Politics,

01:14:13.650 --> 01:14:16.530
I gather that you
don't think the impetus

01:14:16.530 --> 01:14:18.210
for the kind of
change you advocate

01:14:18.210 --> 01:14:19.550
is going to come from elites.

01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:23.040
You talk about the need for
some kind of mass pressure

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.815
to create a more active role
for government in the economy.

01:14:25.815 --> 01:14:28.440
So where do you think the source
of that is going to come from?

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:31.350
That to me seems like
the huge question here.

01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:33.060
From unions?

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:34.050
They're small.

01:14:34.050 --> 01:14:38.702
They're representing a declining
segment of the population.

01:14:38.702 --> 01:14:40.910
They're attached to a
democratic establishment that's

01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:43.120
invested in the status quo.

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:44.620
Some kind of new
social movement?

01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:47.680
Maybe a new Occupy Movement.

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:49.040
We saw how that fizzled out.

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:50.000
It had some effect.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.330
But in the end, it was crushed.

01:14:51.330 --> 01:14:53.085
Is that going to inspire us?

01:14:53.085 --> 01:14:56.970
A Sanders-led uprising?

01:14:56.970 --> 01:14:59.490
Yet, he's up against the
democratic establishment, which

01:14:59.490 --> 01:15:03.370
is sitting on a mountain of
cash and is invested in keeping

01:15:03.370 --> 01:15:04.390
things the way they are.

01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:08.800
Or maybe some kind of a
third-party force arising?

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:11.550
Third parties did have
some kind of an influence

01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:15.130
in pushing through
critical democratic reforms

01:15:15.130 --> 01:15:18.600
in the 1800s and early 1900s.

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.850
Do you foresee something
like that coming about again?

01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:23.700
Where do you see the force,
this mass pressure coming from

01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:26.260
to create the kind of
change you're proposing?

01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:28.190
- Yeah, well, that
is the big question.

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:31.770
And let me just say, if
we left the impression

01:15:31.770 --> 01:15:34.210
in Winner-Take-All Politics
that we don't think elites

01:15:34.210 --> 01:15:37.330
are a really important
part of the solution

01:15:37.330 --> 01:15:39.850
as well as the challenge,
then I wasn't clear enough.

01:15:39.850 --> 01:15:43.210
So it's a combination
of elites that

01:15:43.210 --> 01:15:47.920
are constrained by outside
organization and mass pressure

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:51.080
and elite reformers that really
makes these changes happen.

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:56.920
And so I would say that
the first order of business

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:59.200
would be a serious
internal challenge

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:00.400
within the Democratic Party.

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:03.420
But not so much on
ideological grounds,

01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:05.980
though as we point
out in the book,

01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:09.100
that the Democratic Party became
deeply cross-pressured because

01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:13.131
of its increased reliance
on money from the business

01:16:13.131 --> 01:16:13.630
community.

01:16:13.630 --> 01:16:18.900
But I actually think right now,
it's an organisationally inept

01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:19.900
party.

01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:21.390
It needs to get
its act together.

01:16:21.390 --> 01:16:23.980
And so I'm not so
much concerned about

01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:28.240
whether people are to the left
of the party or the center--

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:31.330
and I do think the party
does need to stake out a more

01:16:31.330 --> 01:16:34.090
progressive vision and economic
policy-- but whether or not

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:36.880
they can actually do things and
build the kind of party that

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:44.420
can compete nationally
and make their opponents

01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:46.360
have to work for every
victory in a way that

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:51.580
makes them extremely vulnerable
in future electoral contests.

01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:56.850
So that would be the
immediate vision.

01:16:56.850 --> 01:16:59.140
On the longer-term vision,
you're absolutely right.

01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:03.850
I don't think, and I
wish I could think,

01:17:03.850 --> 01:17:07.780
but I don't think that the
traditional American union

01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:10.270
as we understood it for
most of the 20th century

01:17:10.270 --> 01:17:13.840
has a long future.

01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:16.330
I think it will
continue to have control

01:17:16.330 --> 01:17:17.440
in pockets of the economy.

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:22.890
But there is no way, I think, to
rebuild a broad working class,

01:17:22.890 --> 01:17:25.242
a middle class
coalition, without having

01:17:25.242 --> 01:17:26.950
some kind of organization
that represents

01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:29.590
the economic interests
of ordinary workers.

01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:32.920
And if it's not going to be
traditional labor unions, what

01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:33.741
is it going to be?

01:17:33.741 --> 01:17:35.740
I really don't know the
answer to that question.

01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:40.020
I have seen some of the sources
in The Fight for Fifteen,

01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:42.480
in the ways in which
it has involved

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:45.010
cross-racial alliances.

01:17:45.010 --> 01:17:48.100
I would mention the Black
Lives Matter movement as well.

01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:50.080
I've seen some of
the potential for it

01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:54.850
in things that fall short
of collective bargaining,

01:17:54.850 --> 01:17:56.545
but forms of worker
representation that

01:17:56.545 --> 01:17:59.600
are consciousness raising
and bringing people together,

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.960
and that use some
digital technologies,

01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:04.270
but are built ultimately
on ground level

01:18:04.270 --> 01:18:05.950
organization and meetings.

01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:15.730
And finally, I would say
that I see this as, in part,

01:18:15.730 --> 01:18:18.310
a question of
whether or not we're

01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:23.710
going to have a political
movement and leadership that

01:18:23.710 --> 01:18:27.520
is able to make this
difficult case that combines

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:31.810
a critique of the corruption and
extremism of present government

01:18:31.810 --> 01:18:35.020
and a recognition of the
essential role of government

01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:36.880
in achieving our prosperity.

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:42.520
And if I was someone who
could write slogans or craft

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:47.310
effective political strategies,
that's what I would try to do.

01:18:47.310 --> 01:18:48.100
I'm not.

01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:52.340
What I can say is that there
is no future for progressivism

01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:54.880
in the United States
that isn't also

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:57.790
able and willing to embrace
the active use of government

01:18:57.790 --> 01:18:58.870
in the 21st century.

01:18:58.870 --> 01:19:02.100
And so we're kind of at a
Hamilton moment, if you will.

01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:04.426
And of course, we all
know Alexander Hamilton.

01:19:04.426 --> 01:19:06.880
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:09.460
The Articles of
Confederation are--

01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:14.280
we remember the Constitution as
being the Revolution, and then

01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:15.920
the Seinfeld style.

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:18.760
We go revolution,
yada-yada-yada, Constitution.

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:19.324
Right?

01:19:19.324 --> 01:19:21.240
But there's a big thing
in the yada-yada-yada.

01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:23.830
That's the Articles of
Confederation, the failure

01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:24.810
of institutional form.

01:19:24.810 --> 01:19:26.987
I believe right now,
if you look at the IRS,

01:19:26.987 --> 01:19:28.570
if you look at
discretionary spending,

01:19:28.570 --> 01:19:32.560
if you look at all of
these crucial areas

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.330
of public authority,
we're moving

01:19:34.330 --> 01:19:37.830
toward the kind of
ineffective public authority

01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:40.460
that that is corrupt
and incapable.

01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:43.590
It's like the perfect
negative combination.

01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:49.480
And that we cannot rebuild
a strong and effective left

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:53.620
or a strong and effective union
movement without rebuilding

01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:55.920
a strong and effective
government as well.

01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:57.050
So thank you.

01:19:57.050 --> 01:19:59.150
[APPLAUSE]

01:19:59.150 --> 01:20:02.500
