Thanks for your answer.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.550
If you tried TalkBack 
on the Sunshine app,

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.976
you'll notice that one easy fix 
to make our app more accessible,

00:00:06.976 --> 00:00:09.842
is to add content descriptions
to our image views.

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:12.580
Because there's no spoken text 
when a user taps on it.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.950
In the forecast adapter,

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.510
after we read the 
weather forecast from the cursor

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.780
we also set it as a content 
description on the icon.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.180
Similarly, in the detail fragment, 
once we get the weather forecast,

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.320
we set that as the content
description on the icon.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.510
Now clicking on the image, 
speaks the weather description out loud.
