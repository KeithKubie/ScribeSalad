00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.600
I believe important things are whether the product is really wanted,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.580
and whether people will&nbsp;like the service and keep using it.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.500
We are the developers of Fril, a flea market app.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.840
We discovered that many women

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.760
upload photos of clothes to their blogs to sell them.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.380
We thought creating an app that made it easy to buy and sell clothes

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.920
might be a good business opportunity.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.600
Most of our users are young women, such as college students and housewives.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.260
Before release, we interviewed more than 100 women

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.000
to test our service.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.160
We came up with our design by working with our users.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.300
During development, we had users actually use our prototype.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.980
And we tested it to make sure that users were able to use it in the way they expected.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.480
We also used many interviews and surveys about the app's visual design

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.340
to find a design that users would like.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.960
We've been using this approach since our company was founded,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.800
helping instill a corporate culture where we create our service with the help of our users.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.920
We introduced the new "Material Design" concept

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.700
during the development of the app

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.960
in a way that wouldn't affect the experience of existing users,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.180
so our initial release was about 70% Material Design compliant.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.340
The results were remarkable.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.600
Our new user retention rate rose by 7%.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.420
And time spent in app increased by an incredible 200%.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.320
We hire our customer support staff from our user base,

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.920
so all of them use the app.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.220
We use focus groups and user testing

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.380
whenever we consider adding features and to test new designs.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.600
The designers themselves perform layout adjustments

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.880
using Android Studio.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.840
It allows you to test using various devices while you're adjusting the design,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.900
and it has features like code completion, which make it very easy for designers to use as well.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.400
Since our app is used for buying and selling between individuals,

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.140
and you can even withdraw money with it,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.740
encountering things like bugs can be a major problem.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.700
The Developer Console for Android developers

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.680
has a feature that lets you release in stages,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.520
so you can release an update 5% or 20% at a time,

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.720
and this lets you find out ahead of time if there are any bugs.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.340
It's very convenient.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.800
Ever since we became compliant with Google's Material Design,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.280
our retention rate has increased by 20%

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.620
and our sign-up rate has increased by 30%.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.440
Whether you have a product that people really want,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.920
and whether they will like your service enough to keep using it are very important questions.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.860
We created our company name "Fablic"

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.036
based on a combination of the words

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.340
"fab" (meaning fabulous) and "holic" (meaning addicted).

00:02:41.343 --> 00:02:42.723
We want to live up to our name by making a service

00:02:42.723 --> 00:02:46.120
that our users will really become addicted to.
