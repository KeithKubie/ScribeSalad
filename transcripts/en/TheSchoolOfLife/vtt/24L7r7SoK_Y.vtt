00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.980
it doesn't seem to make sense to suggest
that there might be such a thing as good

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:10.920
materialism. After all isn't materialism
just plain bad always? It can seem as if

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.150
we're faced with a stark choice. Either
you can be materialistic and that means

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.710
obsessed with money and possessions
shallow and selfish, or you can reject

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.260
materialism be good and focus on more
important matters of the Spirit. But in

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.699
truth most of us are in our hearts stuck
somewhere between these two choices,

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.930
which is pretty uncomfortable. We're
still in meshed in the desire to possess

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.450
but we're encouraged to feel rather bad
about it. Yet crucially it's not actually

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.680
materialism the pure fact of buying
things and getting excited by

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.450
possessions that ever really the problem.
With failing to make a clear distinction

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.699
between good and bad versions of
materialism. Let's try to understand good

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.820
materialism through a slightly
unusual route,

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.010
religion. Because we see them as focused
exclusively on spiritual things it can

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.270
be surprising to note how much use
religions have made of material things.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.189
They've spent a lot of time making and
thinking about Scrolls to hang in your

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:18.270
house - shrines, temples,  monasteries,
artworks, clothes, ceremonies; however,

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.320
they've cared about these things for one
reason only, because they've wanted

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.780
material things to serve the highest and
noblest purpose, the development of our

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.360
souls. It's just that they've recognized
that we are incarnate sensory bodily

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.860
beings and that the way to get through
to our souls has to be at least in part

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.689
through our bodies rather than merely
through the intellect. The importance of

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.790
material things was for centuries at the
core of Christianity, which proposed that

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.130
Jesus was both the highest spiritual
being and a flashing blood person. He was

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.399
the spirit incarnate, holiness embodied
in the Catholic Mass great significance

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.530
is accorded to the bread and wine which
are believed to be transubstantiation of

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.899
Christ. That is material objects which
simultaneously have a spiritual identity

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.620
just as Jesus himself combined the
spiritual and the

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.209
bodily while on Earth. This can all sound
like a very weird and arcane point

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.069
entirely removed from the local shopping
mall. But exactly the same concept

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.799
actually applies outside of religions
many good material possessions can be

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.940
said to involve a kind of
transubstantiation whereby they are both

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.060
practical and physical and also embody
or allude to a positive personality or

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.370
spirit. Take this watch by the designer
dieter Rams to the outer I it's an

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.260
ordinary timepiece. But at a
psychological level it's also a kind of

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.280
transubstantiation. It tells the
time but it also hints at a more

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.489
psychological even spiritual side with
ideals of purity simplicity and harmony

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.109
floating around it. It tells us how long
there is to lunch but it's also trying

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:09.840
to nudge us towards being a certain sort
of person. Or take this chair it too

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.120
transubstantiate a set of important values
straightforwardness, strength, honesty

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.410
and elegance by getting closer to the
chair we stand to become a little more

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.239
like it which is an important piece of
inner evolution. Material objects can

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.530
therefore be said to play a positive
psychological or spiritual role in our

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.859
lives when higher more positive ideals
are materialized in them and so when

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.549
buying and using them daily gives us a
chance to get closer to our better

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.049
selves. When they're contained in
physical things valuable psychological

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.190
qualities that are otherwise often
intermittent in our thoughts and conduct

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.290
can become more stable and resilient.
This isn't to say that all consumerism

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.190
just conveniently turns out to be great
it depends on what a given material

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:02.400
object stands for. An object can
transubstantiated sides of human nature

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.940
greed callousness the desire to triumph
as much as it can the best sides. So we

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.900
must be careful not to decry or
celebrate all material consumption just

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.789
like that. We have to ensure that the
objects we invest in and tire ourselves

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:22.409
and the planet by making are those that
lend most encouragement to our higher

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:26.000
better natures.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.810
