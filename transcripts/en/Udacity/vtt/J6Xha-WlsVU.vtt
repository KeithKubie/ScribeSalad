00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's consider a problem where I throw the ball with an initial velocity of 50 m/s.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
But this time I don't say V₀x or V₀y,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
because this is not purely horizontal or purely vertical. It's at an angle.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Now, we know if we can break this problem into two 1-dimensional motion problems we're all set.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So, that's should be our end goal.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Let's pause for a second. Not literally. Don't hit the pause button.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But let's think back to when we first started talking about horizontal and vertical velocity.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Remember how we talked about a ball with vertical and horizontal velocity components?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Well, these components were just a way of thinking about the true velocity,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
which was off at some angle.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In that case, we went from components to the true velocity.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Now, we're going to go the other way.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
What do I mean by that?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I mean, we're going to make a right triangle. How do we do it?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Well, here's our angled side. Here's our hypotenuse.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Now, I've broken this hypotenuse down into what I call components--

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
a horizontal and a vertical initial velocity component.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Now, if I call this angle α, and I tell you that α is equal to about 53 degrees,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
can you tell me what V₀y equals?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You might have to think back to the trigonometry from unit 1.

00:01:08.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Enter your answer here and round to the nearest whole number.
