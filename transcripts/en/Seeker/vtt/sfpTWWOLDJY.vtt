00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.910
One good thing about music is when it hits
you, you feel no pain.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:10.530
Unless your eardrums and lungs explode.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.950
Hello everyone, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.240
At worst, loud noises are an annoyance.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.410
Your neighbor’s got the stereo cranked up,
a baby in a movie theater is crying, you live

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.869
near a police siren testing facility, whatever.

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.659
You’ll be irritated, but you’ll live.

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:29.980
OR WILL YOU???

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.640
Is it possible for a sound to be so loud,
it makes you dead?

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.740
The European Space Agency seems to think so.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.690
The ESA actually has an array of four gigantic
horns at the Large European Acoustic Facility

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.500
in Noordwijk, the Netherlands.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.750
If they crank it up to 11, the horns can produce
sound as loud as 154 decibels, which they

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.399
reckon could definitely burst your eardrums
right away and maybe cause serious damage

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:53.940
from long term exposure.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.149
But those freaky deaky Dutch aren’t using
their Horn Section of Doom as a weapon, they’re

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.649
using it to see if satellites can withstand
the sound of a rocket launch.

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.740
See, sound is a mechanical wave caused by
oscillations in air pressure.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.689
The greater the change in air pressure, the
higher the amplitude, the more energy it carries

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.880
and the louder we interpret that sound to
be.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.840
If a sound is loud enough, or at the right
frequency, it can shake something to pieces.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.130
This is why the space shuttle’s launch platform
would dump 350,000 gallons of water onto itself

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.960
during launch to dampen the sound and keep
it from damaging the shuttle.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.899
Otherwise the 195 decibels the engines pumped
out would put too much stress on the shuttle's

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:31.899
wings.

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.040
As it happens, it’s speculated that 195
decibels is totally enough loudness to kill

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.040
you dead.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.619
It’s thought the threshold is anywhere from
185 to 200 decibels.

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.869
Sound waves with that big of a pressure fluctuation
might damage your lungs, either forcing an

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.990
air bubble into your blood that would then
cause cardiac arrest, or by making your lungs

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.350
themselves pop.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.320
Not a lot of research on this has been done,
though German researcher Jurgen Altmann showed

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.909
that a sound wave at 210 decibels caused lung
damage.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.320
Research has been conducted on fish with and
without air bladders, to see if they were

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.469
injured by the loud sounds caused by pile
drivers…

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.009
The machines that pound bridge supports into
mud, not the wrestling move.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.570
Indeed fish without air bladders showed no
injuries, while the two species with air bladders

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.830
were severely damaged by sound alone.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.160
So, why doesn’t some mad scientist just
crank those ESA horns and create a devastating

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.160
sound gun?

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.750
I mean we’re already at 154 decibels, what’s
another 40?

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.050
Well, it’s not as easy as it sounds because
the decibel scale is a bit misleading.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.430
People often quote that a conversation is
around 60 decibels, a rock concert is 115

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.720
decibels, and so on.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.349
But what that explanation doesn’t tell you
is the decibel scale is logarithmic: a sound

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.370
at 90 decibels has 10 times the energy as
a sound at 80 decibels.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.300
So to get those monstrous European horns to
lethal levels, the sound wave they generate

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.090
would need to have 10,000 times more energy
and the change in air pressure they cause

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.890
would be 100 times greater.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.520
If you’d want to make someone’s head explode
a la Scanners, you’d probably have to have

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.750
100 times the amplitude again, going all the
way up to 240 decibels.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.209
And keep in mind, you’d have to put the
person’s head right next to the sound source

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.090
for that to happen because sound dissipates.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.459
I think it’s safe to say that while sound
can theoretically kill you, it’s probably

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.489
not going to happen…

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.590
Just don’t go wandering under any space
shuttle rockets without hearing protection.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.400
Look, if you're one of those mad scientists
who ARE looking to weaponize sound and use

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:31.430
it for your own nefarious purposes you should
watch Trace's ancient DNews episode here.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:44.290
Are there 
any other things you think could be weirdly

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.650
fatal you want us to look into?
