00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.159
it's probably like nuclear fusion you

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.870
know yours people when will the first

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.580
nuclear fusion power be available and

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.350
the answer is always in 50 years time

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.349
and the answer is and when will there be

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.210
genuinely intelligent machines well I

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.960
might be very wrong here but some optimists

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.060
tell within 10 years I said well

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.529
maybe it's 50 years maybe it will always

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.570
be 50 years I just do not know Turing

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.359
was fascinated with the idea of how

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.730
intelligent could you make a machine be

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.160
the imitation game itself was a game

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.850
Turing devised to what yes the idea

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.510
was that if you're at the other end of a

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.600
telephone line and you gotta, I think in

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.980
those days of course it was a teletype

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.350
or a dumb terminal you know you type

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.000
questions at something and the answer

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.670
comes back and if after an agreed period

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.820
of time you're then asked was that a

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.010
human you were talking to or was it a

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.289
machine if you can't decide that it's

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.199
not human then it's passed the test it's

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.600
masqueraded as a human I think what he

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.670
realized all along perhaps teasing

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.200
as a little and it's always seemed to me

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.860
is that with a limited bandwidth for

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.260
interaction like that it's very probably

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.509
one of Turing's own undecidable problem

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.210
you can't get enough information to come

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.310
to a rational decision as to whether

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.409
it's a human or a machine but this

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.450
doesn't stop there being i think, is this

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.340
right, there's a yearly competition now

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.650
they normally give scores like you know

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.450
sixty percent thought it was human forty

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.710
percent thought it was machine then

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.630
answer is it's machine and stuff like

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.060
that to me you see it really is it as i

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.840
was saying a case of undecidability if

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.520
you need to visit the other end of the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.960
line and see whether there's somebody

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.820
typing teletype to come to a decision

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.860
but then of course that spoils the whole

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.439
nature of the test it was a topic that

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.170
fascinated Turing and one that he

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.290
really really cared about and it's

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.360
interesting had he lived i'd love to

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.180
know what he makes of the present day

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.700
artificial intelligence scene and just

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.170
what is easy to do in the AI field and

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.649
what is hard and my own observation and

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.420
i'm not an expert sorry

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.190
fully expect to be put in my place and told

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.190
her royal is that the computer could do

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.860
a fixed task in a narrow domain very

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.870
differently to a human and be super

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.650
batted example chess absolutely superb

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.739
example I think deep blue be Kasparov

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.890
way back when but it absolutely did not

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.220
use the pattern matching analysis type

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.230
thing with the Grandmaster would do it's

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.910
brute force you know the whole game tree

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.980
as it were chess if I do this don't do

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.959
that then do that I mean your average

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.550
chess player might be able to look six

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.930
or seven moves ahead over all

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.400
possibilities blast deep blue can go I

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.430
lord knows how many moves ahead and

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.209
actually this I think is is it is a good

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.310
examplar of this because what

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.269
grandmasters were missing and actually

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.670
what I think ken Thompson's chess

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.430
machine Bell help to fill in is he I

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.040
think he did all five piece endings or

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.170
something like that and the ones that

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.209
the grandmasters didn't know about

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.430
because they needed tons of look ahead

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.000
I think that is right is the ones way you

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.489
absolutely do something stupid you go

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.220
miles or what he and the rest of them say

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.109
don't do that no no you don't do that

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.730
this machine's stupid it's gonna lose it's

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.590
gonna lose you know then right at the

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.170
very end a tiny little thing that nobody

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.140
had noticed and from the absolute depths

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.900
of near defeat he suddenly finds a

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.209
sneaky little way to make this pawn do

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.130
that matter now before we know where you

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.620
are it's a squeaker narrow victory in

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.750
only 10,000 moves or something like that

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.700
you know I'm exaggerating but you get

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.920
the idea that it's those where you would

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.049
have to go miles away from the solution

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.239
into an area where human said there's no

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.160
hope it's everything is lost but it

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.079
isn't there's a sneaky little Holly way

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.209
through to getting a victory that's the

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.120
kind of things a machine can do but a

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.220
human can't. Then the other side of that is the travelling salesman

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.190
problem where there are so many

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.900
possibilities but a human would just

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.609
look at an opera go well i'm going to

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.380
try that well there is a connection

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.419
there's an interesting one too you're

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.950
quite right that it's one of these

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.600
classic NP complete problems you

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.880
it is believed that there is no way to

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.730
get the perfect answer than simply to

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.760
look at every single possibility and the

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.050
monumental way the combinations of those

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.930
add up is just mind-boggling however

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.270
what I think people in the field will

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.380
tell you is there is a very good set of

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.360
algorithms which will give you a pretty

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.210
darn good answer even though it might

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.790
not be absolutely perfect and that's the

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.460
differences between you know good enough

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.590
within five or six percent in the best

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.140
versus must be absolutely the best route

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.600
so that kind of brings you back to the

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.790
whole human versus computer Turing

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.220
thing which is if I'm on the end of the

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.290
phone or the teletype and I say I'd know

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.610
what color is music yeah this is the

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.890
problem about that Turing test game you

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.280
know you could get either end of the

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.900
equation trying to play silly games I

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.910
think there was a program called Perry

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.180
probably invented was it a Stanford

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.420
somewhere in America Perry was going to

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.160
replicate the speech patterns of a

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.500
paranoid schizophrenic you say and you

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.810
can imagine if you're up against that

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.390
and you don't know whether the other end

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.660
is actually a real schizophrenic person

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.600
or a program simulating that behavior

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.760
that is far harder to tell the

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.770
difference or on because you know you

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.400
you ask some perfectly ordinary question

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.780
like what is two plus two I don't know

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.490
why you're focusing on two it's my

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.220
hated number and all this kind of stuff

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.380
it makes it very very difficult to start

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.960
saying that is a human but one with a

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.930
mental problem versus that is a program

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.210
that's simulating that sort of thing so

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.970
I think it's the thing that AI always

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.570
runs into is this that getting a part

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.510
way answer but by very different routes

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.970
than a human would I'm giving you enough

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.680
information about navigating to return

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.870
to be useful fine is when you start

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.330
wanting total perfection and fantastic

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.730
subtlety but because things fall apart

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.370
because that's the thing as well

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.140
ambiguity that humans are accustomed to

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.180
and the idea of inflection in town

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.090
yeah so for instance ok Google how do

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.860
you pronounce something in Hungarian

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.350
so it's given us the word for something

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.600
in Hungarian and bess it it's told us it

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.360
pronounced it like this follow me but

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.669
I'm being more general about it so I

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:58.160
want to know how Hungarians pronounce

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.919
things on the air fabulous things like

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:06.139
ambiguity and use of similes and

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:10.669
metaphors is a classic for throwing

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:12.830
things off there's a real classic from

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.080
the seventies I think it is is you know

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.919
okay artificial intelligence program

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:20.720
analyze the difference between time

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.990
flies like an arrow and fruit flies like

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:29.990
a banana now that's a beauty because you

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.789
know time flies like an arrow it's a

00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:33.639
simile and all this kind of thing

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:35.690
extension of a metaphor but on the other

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.340
hand the other one which on the surface

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.500
has got a very similar grammatical structure

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.400
Time flies is a noun phrase like ah it's

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.169
not like you've been used in the similar

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:47.630
sense it's like is a joy and a clearly

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.180
eating a banana you say now it's that

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.880
kind of subtlety and that kind of

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.260
knowledge of how the real world works

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.500
allied to syntactic analysis that's what

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.990
you and I use all the time you know and

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.389
what computer systems would find so very

00:08:05.389 --> 00:08:06.830
very difficult but of course you're

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.659
inviting the computer program to sort of

00:08:08.659 --> 00:08:10.220
say hey there must be a thing called a

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.220
time fly and they live on an exclusive

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.830
diet of a truce oh yeah we know that's

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.199
impossible so we're using that kind of

00:08:18.199 --> 00:08:20.990
knowledge over this whole domain of what

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.180
the real world is like in order to

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.729
disambiguate between those two all the

00:08:25.729 --> 00:08:27.289
successes of artificial intelligence

00:08:27.289 --> 00:08:29.870
tend to be a narrow domains you know if

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.300
you're like so play chess is one example

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.610
there's a thing they did it stanford

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:38.060
mice in i think it was about antibiotics

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.570
and their effect and the great advantage

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.909
of course are you with a computer is if

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:46.730
it is all done by logic then it will do

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:47.670
it and it will not

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.130
get tired and it will not usually make

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.960
mistakes unless you're counting up

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.450
Gangnam style hits but that's the point

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.580
you know you don't get bored you don't

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.800
make mistakes if you're a computer so therefore

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.470
that's why they often outperform humans

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.780
roger penrose very famous mathematician

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.880
at oxford got really rather hot under

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.440
the collar about all this I think he

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.090
wrote a book called something like the

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.250
emperor's new mind had a real go at

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.650
artificial intelligence basically said

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.840
the trouble is you're assuming that the

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.450
human brain is just like a very complex

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.180
Turing machine what I am convinced it's

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.820
more than that i Roger Penrose think

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.950
there are quantum effects and if only my

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.140
neurological medical friends would tell

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.400
me how to find them and how to

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.500
categorize them I'm able to tell you

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.660
more about the computational model that

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.340
is really going on in the human brain

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.320
but I've not read anything about that

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.600
recently so it's on the to-do list I

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.840
think

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.620
friendly environment by enveloping

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.110
around the agent in question Lemaitre

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.150
every time that had got up to nine it

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.820
would nudge the dial to the left of it

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.650
to move on one plus they get stuck in

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:55.870
what's called a local maximum or a local

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:58.270
minimum on the left will be 2 to the

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:01.050
power zeros
