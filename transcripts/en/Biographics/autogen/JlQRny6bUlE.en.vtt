00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.680
Viktor Frankl was put through some of the
most horrific struggles a human being could

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.680
imagine.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.320
But he never lost hope, and used his experiences
to continue his work helping other people

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.009
find meaning in their lives.

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:18.099
Frankl’s story is one of strength, of hope,
and of a man who made an impact on the world.

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:27.579
Let’s dive into it...

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.320
Early Life

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.110
In 1905, Viktor Frankl was born the middle
child of a Jewish family in Vienna.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.399
His parents were government employees, and
the family was comfortable.

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.050
Then World War I hit.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.410
Like so many other families of that time,
the Frankls had to contend with bitter poverty.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.289
He and his siblings even had to go from farm
to farm begging for food as the war progressed.

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.640
As a young child, Frankl showed interest and
aptitude in the medical profession.At only

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.840
three years old he wanted to be a doctor.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.420
Then, at four years old he had the realization
every human has to go through - that one day,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.520
he would die.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.070
Still a toddler, Frankl’s life work had
already started to take shape.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.110
By the time he was in high school, Frankl
was already studying psychology and philosophy.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.480
He even gave a speech called “On the Meaning
of Life” in 1921, two years before his graduation.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.070
And when he had to write a final paper for
graduation, what else would he write it on

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.990
but the psychology of philosophical thought?

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.660
By the time he turned twenty, he had already
been in touch with Dr. Sigmund Freud.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.450
Frankl wrote Freud a letter and included a
copy of one of his own papers in it.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.250
More impressively, the famous doctor then
requested that Frankl allow him to publish

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.490
one of the papers Frankl had written.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.950
Later, recalling the incident, Frankl still
sounded like he still couldn’t believe the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.010
incident even after decades of building up
his own career.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.070
“Can you imagine?

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.540
Would a 16-year-old mind if Sigmund Freud
asked to have a paper he wrote published?”

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.460
Nearly three years after that correspondence,
Frankl was walking in a park in Vienna and

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.710
encountered a man who looked familiar.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.450
Frankl went up to him, and asked if he was
Sigmund Freud...he was.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.680
And when Frankl began to introduce himself...Freud
recited Frankl’s address to him.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.060
Freud had been so impressed by Frankl that
even as the years passed, he never forgot

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.900
the letter he received from the young man.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.420
Apart from psychology, Frankl also spent his
high school years immersed in politics.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.680
He began his involvement with the Young Socialist
Workers as a teen, and even rose to become

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.200
President of the organization in 1924.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.989
With a string of accomplishments in the field
of psychology already achieved during his

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.129
teen years, Frankl headed to the University
of Vienna to formally study his chosen fields

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.170
of neurology and psychiatry.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.980
Initially, he based his studies in the theories
and ideas that Sigmund Freud had advanced,

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.349
but over time he began moving more towards
Alfred Adler’s ideas.

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.049
Even after moving from Freud’s ideas, Frankl
kept a bust of the preeminent Viennese psychoanalyst

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.220
in his office.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.099
Freud developed psychoanalysis, Adler added
to that with the development of the inferiority

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:00.010
complex, and Frankl become the third of these
giants of psychology in Vienna as he developed

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.450
a search for meaning called logotherapy as
a key part of the study of the human psyche.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.579
But before he became a world-renowned psychiatrist,
Frankl was making a difference much closer

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:11.579
to home.

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.930
As a student he began actively putting into
practice what he was learning and the theories

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:16.930
he was developing.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.090
Moving beyond just academic interest in the
human psyche, Frankl was able to literally

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.379
save lives.

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.489
During his time as a medical student, Frankl
noticed a disturbing trend among students

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.139
in Austrian high schools.

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:33.430
When grades were reported at the end of the
school term, there was a spike in suicides.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.690
Frankl spearheaded an initiative to provide
free counseling to students, with an emphasis

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.230
on helping them at the end of the school term.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.769
Incredibly, the first year that Frankl’s
program was implemented was also the first

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.599
time in recent memory that there were no student
suicides in Vienna.

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.230
With proven success in suicide prevention,
Frankl moved on to become head of the Vienna

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.579
Psychiatric Hospital’s female suicide prevention
program.

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:03.760
From 1933 to 1937, he worked with thousands
of women who were in danger of committing

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.760
suicide.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.329
Then, in 1937 he opened his own private practice.

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:13.799
But a year later, Frankl’s world was uprooted.

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.360
World War II

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.100
In 1938, Germany invaded Austria.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.480
Frankl was Jewish, and under the Nazi regime
he was not permitted to treat Aryan patients.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.150
The Rothschild Hospital in Vienna was the
only place where Jewish patients could be

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.000
treated, and so Frankl was called upon to
use his talents there as head of the neurological

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.110
department.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.390
While working at Rothschild, Frankl was also
waiting to hear news that could lift him out

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.280
of the terrifying situation that so many European
Jews were in.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.510
He had applied for a visa to the United States,
and just needed his lottery number to be called.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.450
He was one of the lucky ones...his lottery
number came up before Pearl Harbor and the

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.440
United States’ entrance into the war.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.130
But Frankl’s decision to leave Austria wasn’t
easy.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.201
The visa, it applied only to Frankl, and not
to any other members of his family.

00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:10.070
His parents and siblings would be left behind
in an ever-scarier environment, and Frankl

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.030
knew their fate was likely to end in a concentration
camp.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.870
Frankl knew he had a choice to make, and he
opted to depend on a higher power than himself

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.470
to guide him in the right direction.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.600
When he came across a fragment of a stone
in his parents house, he knew he had found

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.700
the answer he was looking for.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.870
The stone wasn’t just any old stone - it
was a piece of the Ten Commandments that had

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.660
once stood in a local synagogue.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.710
Burned down by the Nazis, the Synagogue was
reduced to rubble and Frankl’s father had

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.180
picked up a piece of the stone for the family
to have.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.520
And the piece he just happened to pick up?

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.560
It depicted a portion of the commandment “Honor
Thy Father and Mother.”

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.210
To Frankl, this meant his decision was clear.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.190
He would stay in Austria with his family and
be right alongside them as they dealt with

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.150
the horrors the Nazis brought upon them.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.920
And Frankl well knew the horrors the Nazis
were capable of.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.530
He and his wife Tilly were married in 1941,
and the two of them wanted to have children.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.720
But Jewish couples were not allowed to have
children.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.310
Frankl’s wife conceived, but she was not
allowed to give birth.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.770
She was forced to have an abortion.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.260
Then, in 1942, what Frankl had feared would
happen came true.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.840
He, his wife, and his parents were arrested.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.890
They were initially sent to Theresienstadt,
a camp in Czechoslovakia.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.120
There, Frankl did what he could to help others,
running a clinic, helping new prisoners cope

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.520
with the drastic shock of entry into the camp,
and establishing a suicide watch.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.970
Frankl, his wife, and his mother survived
Theresienstadt, but his father did not.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.680
He died after only six months in the camp.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.780
In 1944, Frankl was ordered to Auschwitz.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.120
His mother was also ordered to go, but his
wife was not.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.750
But Tilly wasn’t going to be without her
husband.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.220
She volunteered to be moved to Auschwitz.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.860
The two ended up separated in the end, however.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.220
After arriving at Auschwitz, Tilly was pushed
onward to Bergen-Belsen, while Frankl and

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.190
his mother were both kept at Auschwitz.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.509
At first, they and fifteen hundred others
were kept in a shed meant to hold only 1/6th

00:06:57.509 --> 00:06:58.509
that many people.

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:02.440
The ground was bare, and the prisoners were
forced to squat for days while they subsisted

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.990
on only a small piece of bread.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.210
From here, the prisoners were directed into
two lines...one to the gas chamber and one

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.050
to years of labor and misery, but survival...at
least initially.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.580
Frankl’s mother was executed in the gas
chambers, and Frankl himself barely escaped

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:17.780
that fate.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.850
Frankl was ordered to get into the left line,
but defied the order and stepped into the

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:21.850
other group.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.680
As he only discovered later, the left line
was the line towards the gas chamber and certain

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.680
death.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.340
He was one of the few to survive Auschwitz.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:33.640
1.3 million people were sent through the gates
of Auschwitz...and 1.1 million of them died.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.170
Those who didn’t die right away in the gas
chamber suffered through deaths caused by

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:42.270
starvation and disease, exhaustion from forced
labor, and even medical experiments.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:46.721
Though Auschwitz was the site of a huge number
of atrocities, many others suffered in other

00:07:46.721 --> 00:07:47.721
camps throughout Europe.

00:07:47.721 --> 00:07:51.630
Frankl’s wife was one of those who met their
fate in a different camp from her husband.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.930
Tilly perished at the hands of the Nazis at
the camp known as Bergen-Belsen, and Frankl

00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:01.730
did not learn she had died until the war ended
and he was liberated in 1945.

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.030
Throughout his time suffering in the camps,
not knowing Tilly’s fate, he was able to

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.350
find meaning and a level of comfort in the
knowledge of love.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:12.420
He thought of her throughout his ordeal in
the concentration camps, and recognizing how

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.100
that helped him he started to theorize about
what love meant for human life.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.300
He later set out his thinking this way, in
his famous work “Man’s Search for Meaning,”

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:24.310
“For the first time in my life I saw the
truth as it is set into song by so many poets,

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.420
proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many
thinkers.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.860
The truth - that Love is the ultimate and
highest goal to which man can aspire.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.870
Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest
secret that human poetry and human thought

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.219
and belief have to impart: The salvation of
man is through love and in love.”

00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:43.979
When he was in the concentration camps, Frankl
had to distract himself from the reality of

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:45.120
what he was going through.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.800
He saw death and suffering up close, he was
forced into cattle cars, forced to march,

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.569
contracted typhoid fever, and was separated
from his most beloved family members.

00:08:54.569 --> 00:08:57.540
So what was one way he pushed himself forward
to survive?

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.860
As he explains,

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:03.850
“I repeatedly tried to distance myself from
the misery that surrounded me by externalising

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:04.850
it.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:08.220
I remember marching one morning from the camp
to the work site, hardly able to bear the

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:13.259
hunger, the cold, and pain of my frozen and
festering feet, so swollen . . . My situation

00:09:13.259 --> 00:09:15.259
seemed bleak, even hopeless.

00:09:15.259 --> 00:09:19.460
Then I imagined that I stood at a lectern
in a large, beautiful, warm and bright hall.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:24.171
I was about to give a lecture to an interested
audience on "Psychotherapeutic Experiences

00:09:24.171 --> 00:09:28.519
in a Concentration Camp" (the actual title
I later used . . .). In the imaginary lecture

00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:31.110
I reported the things I am now living through.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.480
Believe me, ladies and gentlemen, at that
moment I could not dare to hope that some

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.620
day it was to be my good fortune to actually
give such a lecture.”

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:42.689
Frankl also made a point of finding a lesson
in goodness and survival in the suffering

00:09:42.689 --> 00:09:45.279
he endured and the suffering he witnessed.

00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:47.339
These themes informed his life’s work.

00:09:47.339 --> 00:09:50.710
““We who lived in concentration camps
can remember the men who walked through the

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:54.290
huts comforting others, giving away their
last piece of bread.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:58.300
They may have been few in number, but they
offer sufficient proof that everything can

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:04.350
be taken from a man but one thing: the last
of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:10.220
in any given set of circumstances, to choose
one's own way.”

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:15.069
Post WWII

00:10:15.069 --> 00:10:19.110
In April of 1945, Frankl had a welcome sight
- American soldiers.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:23.350
They had come to liberate the concentration
camps, meaning Frankl was once again a free

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.350
man.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:27.749
He did not have family left, save for a sister
who had escaped to Australia.

00:10:27.749 --> 00:10:32.309
He was essentially starting new in the world
- but he had his ideas, his education, and

00:10:32.309 --> 00:10:34.089
his professional experience.

00:10:34.089 --> 00:10:35.819
So he put his ideas into writing.

00:10:35.819 --> 00:10:41.380
In only nine days during the summer of 1945
Frankl dictated a full manuscript.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:45.319
The result was “Man’s Search for Meaning,”
a description of what life was like in the

00:10:45.319 --> 00:10:51.050
concentration camps and the coinciding realizations
Frankl had during his time as a prisoner about

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:54.559
the need for meaning in human life and the
role of suffering in the world.

00:10:54.559 --> 00:11:00.390
The book served as the basic outline for ‘logotherapy,’
the idea posited by Frankl that men are most

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.540
driven by a search for meaning.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:08.160
By 1946, he was fully back into his professional
world, running the Vienna Polyclinic of Neurology.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.050
By 1948, he had earned a pHD in Philosophy.

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:15.290
He began teaching at the University of Vienna,
where he would remain as a professor until

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:16.529
1990.

00:11:16.529 --> 00:11:19.860
After he was released from the concentration
camp, Frankl also remarried.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:24.060
In 1947, he married Eleonore Schwint, and
the two had a daughter together.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.230
As an adult, Frankl’s daughter followed
in her famous father’s footsteps and became

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:29.370
a child psychiatrist.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:33.389
Though he was teaching at the University of
Vienna, Frankl’s teachings soon began to

00:11:33.389 --> 00:11:35.449
make a worldwide impact.

00:11:35.449 --> 00:11:39.490
With Freud and Adler as his predecessors,
Vienna had already established itself as a

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:43.089
center of psychological and psychiatric study.

00:11:43.089 --> 00:11:47.519
Freud and Adler were the first and second
schools of Viennese Psychotherapy, and Frankl’s

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:50.899
ideas about man needing meaning in his life
became the third.

00:11:50.899 --> 00:11:55.100
By the mid 1950s Frankl was being invited
to speak at universities around the world.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:12:00.399
He had also created the Austrian Medical Society
for Psychotherapy, and headed up the organization.

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:05.769
In 1955, the University of Vienna made him
a full professor, and by 1961 he was serving

00:12:05.769 --> 00:12:10.120
as a visiting professor at Harvard and his
ideas were being cemented in the minds of

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.249
those studying psychotherapy in the United
States.

00:12:13.249 --> 00:12:17.369
His academic career continued to grow, as
he lectured at over 200 universities and was

00:12:17.369 --> 00:12:20.829
awarded an astonishing 29 honorary degrees.

00:12:20.829 --> 00:12:25.709
Though Man’s Search For Meaning was by far
his best known work, Frankl also wrote and

00:12:25.709 --> 00:12:28.779
published 39 other books during his lifetime.

00:12:28.779 --> 00:12:33.889
In 1970, he was honored by his peers when
they created the “Viktor Frankl Insitute.”

00:12:33.889 --> 00:12:36.629
Among his academic work, Frankl still worked
with patients.

00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:41.050
One of his methods was to ask the most depressed
patients he encountered a seemingly simple

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:42.130
six word question…

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.370
''Why do you not commit suicide?''

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:49.509
From here, Frankl would discover what it was
that the patient actually found joy in, what

00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:54.029
made their life worth living … in other
words, what the meaning was in their life.

00:12:54.029 --> 00:12:56.600
Once that discovery was made, he could start
helping them to improve their mental health

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.829
and to move away from thoughts of suicide.

00:12:58.829 --> 00:13:03.149
As the 20th century progressed, Frankl shared
his ideas in media beyond print.

00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:07.810
He appeared on television to discuss his ideas,
bringing them to an entirely new audience.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:12.170
In one of his most famous television appearances
he expounded on his idea that in the search

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:16.470
for life’s meaning one must have a balance
of freedom and responsibility.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:20.079
During the discussion, he advocated for the
United States to have a partner monument for

00:13:20.079 --> 00:13:21.360
the Statue of Liberty.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:26.309
The country should be bookended with a statue
of responsibility on the West Coast, he argued.

00:13:26.309 --> 00:13:28.630
“Freedom, however, is not the last word.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:31.529
Freedom is only part of the story and half
of the truth.

00:13:31.529 --> 00:13:36.630
Freedom is but the negative aspect of the
whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:37.630
responsibleness.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:41.879
In fact, freedom is in danger of degenerating
into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived

00:13:41.879 --> 00:13:43.640
in terms of responsibleness.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.319
That is why I recommend that the Statue of
Liberty on the East Coast be supplemented

00:13:47.319 --> 00:13:50.910
by a Statue of Responsibility on the West
Coast”

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:55.119
Answering letters and doing interviews, Frankl
continued to share his message and teach the

00:13:55.119 --> 00:13:59.809
world about his theories of psychoanalysis
right up until his death in 1992.

00:13:59.809 --> 00:14:04.379
In one of his last interviews, Frankl made
the poignant observation that even looking

00:14:04.379 --> 00:14:09.209
back decades later, he could still find value
in his suffering at the concentration camps.

00:14:09.209 --> 00:14:13.819
As he saw it, the suffering gave him a valuable
perspective on what real trouble is, making

00:14:13.819 --> 00:14:17.940
him more appreciative of the life he could
live freely from 1946 onward.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:23.470
“What I would have given then if I could
have had no greater problem than I face today,”

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:30.310
he said in 1995.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:32.029
Legacy

00:14:32.029 --> 00:14:36.300
When he was in the concentration camps, Viktor
Frankl lived out the idea that he later imparted

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.290
to the world in Man’s Search For Meaning:

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:42.459
“Everything can be taken from a man but
one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to

00:14:42.459 --> 00:14:47.809
choose one’s attitude in any given set of
circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”

00:14:47.809 --> 00:14:51.980
While he was in the concentration camps, Viktor
Frankl opted to think of his wife, to think

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.749
of his profession, to theorize about how he
could use his experience with suffering to

00:14:56.749 --> 00:14:58.490
impact others’ lives.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:02.779
He stole paper from the camp offices to jot
down his ideas, and knew that he had two reasons

00:15:02.779 --> 00:15:08.040
to make it out alive - love, and a responsibility
to help people find meaning and avoid what

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:12.339
he called the “existential stress” of
living without meaning.

00:15:12.339 --> 00:15:15.379
From the time he was a student, Frankl was
helping to save lives.

00:15:15.379 --> 00:15:19.740
Though he couldn’t save the lives of his
closest family, he was able to persevere through

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:25.499
unimaginable horrors and spend the next five
decades making a positive impact on the world.

00:15:25.499 --> 00:15:28.839
Viktor Frankl could have given up, he could
have died, or he could have lived the rest

00:15:28.839 --> 00:15:30.860
of his life bitter from what he had gone through.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.360
No one would have blamed him.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:38.179
But instead, his life has touched millions,
his book has been translated into 74 languages,

00:15:38.179 --> 00:15:44.489
and he’s impacted generations of new psychotherapists
who will spend their lives helping people.

00:15:44.489 --> 00:16:02.849
Viktor Frankl...a life lived with meaning,
indeed.
