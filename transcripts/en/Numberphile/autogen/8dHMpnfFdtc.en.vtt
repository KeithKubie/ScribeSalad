single border I can run my finger around

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930
single border I can run my finger around
 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.710
single border I can run my finger around
the border here and if I go around the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720
the border here and if I go around the
 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.780
the border here and if I go around the
loop twice I'm coming back to where I

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790
loop twice I'm coming back to where I
 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.210
loop twice I'm coming back to where I
started so this is not the edge this is

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220
started so this is not the edge this is
 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.330
started so this is not the edge this is
the edge of the thin surface this

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340
the edge of the thin surface this
 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.359
the edge of the thin surface this
particular plastic piece has two borders

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369
particular plastic piece has two borders
 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.240
particular plastic piece has two borders
you know one is a circular here and the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250
you know one is a circular here and the
 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.760
you know one is a circular here and the
other one is this particular edge here

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770
other one is this particular edge here
 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.530
other one is this particular edge here
so this is the path where as an ant was

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540
so this is the path where as an ant was
 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.630
so this is the path where as an ant was
crawling on it would cast seven that's

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640
crawling on it would cast seven that's
 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.700
crawling on it would cast seven that's
right and if we look at this piece of

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710
right and if we look at this piece of
 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.390
right and if we look at this piece of
paper this one has three borders one is

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400
paper this one has three borders one is
 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.399
paper this one has three borders one is
the rectangle frame on the outside and

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
the rectangle frame on the outside and
 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.889
the rectangle frame on the outside and
then we have you know a circular border

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899
then we have you know a circular border
 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.380
then we have you know a circular border
here and suffer kidney shape border over

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390
here and suffer kidney shape border over
 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.539
here and suffer kidney shape border over
on this particular case so this is the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549
on this particular case so this is the
 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.230
on this particular case so this is the
first number the second number is the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240
first number the second number is the
 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.740
first number the second number is the
sidedness of a surface so this piece of

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750
sidedness of a surface so this piece of
 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.870
sidedness of a surface so this piece of
paper is clearly two-sided as a matter

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880
paper is clearly two-sided as a matter
 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.200
paper is clearly two-sided as a matter
of fact it has a blue side and it has a

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210
of fact it has a blue side and it has a
 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.530
of fact it has a blue side and it has a
white side and you cannot get from one

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540
white side and you cannot get from one
 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.050
white side and you cannot get from one
side to the other without crawling over

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060
side to the other without crawling over
 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.290
side to the other without crawling over
this very sharp edge where an ant would

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300
this very sharp edge where an ant would
 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.330
this very sharp edge where an ant would
copy itself to death the Mobius band on

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340
copy itself to death the Mobius band on
 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.280
copy itself to death the Mobius band on
the other hand has a single side if you

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290
the other hand has a single side if you
 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.940
the other hand has a single side if you
start

painting and spreading your paint

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720
painting and spreading your paint
 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.140
painting and spreading your paint
without ever crossing one of the edges

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150
without ever crossing one of the edges
 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.790
without ever crossing one of the edges
you would come around and you would note

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800
you would come around and you would note
 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.949
you would come around and you would note
this that by the time you're done you

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959
this that by the time you're done you
 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.960
this that by the time you're done you
have actually painted both sides of this

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970
have actually painted both sides of this
 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.270
have actually painted both sides of this
particular surface so that's a single

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280
particular surface so that's a single
 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.790
particular surface so that's a single
sided surface with a single edge on the

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800
sided surface with a single edge on the
 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.009
sided surface with a single edge on the
other hand the Klein bottle here is also

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019
other hand the Klein bottle here is also
 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.100
other hand the Klein bottle here is also
single sided surface but as you can see

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110
single sided surface but as you can see
 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.920
single sided surface but as you can see
it has no edges however we cannot really

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930
it has no edges however we cannot really
 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.089
it has no edges however we cannot really
create a completely closed Klein bottle

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099
create a completely closed Klein bottle
 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.130
create a completely closed Klein bottle
in three-dimensional space without

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140

having either some opening some

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360
having either some opening some
 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.690
having either some opening some
punctures or a self-intersection line

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700
punctures or a self-intersection line
 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.360
punctures or a self-intersection line
and you can see here here is one of

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370
and you can see here here is one of
 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.390
and you can see here here is one of
those self-intersection lines now if I

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400
those self-intersection lines now if I
 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.309
those self-intersection lines now if I
don't like these self-intersection lines

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319
don't like these self-intersection lines
 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.520
don't like these self-intersection lines
I could cut a slightly larger hole into

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530
I could cut a slightly larger hole into
 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.339
I could cut a slightly larger hole into
the wall of the thick arm so that the

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349
the wall of the thick arm so that the
 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.770
the wall of the thick arm so that the
thin arm then can be passing through so

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780
thin arm then can be passing through so
 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.690
thin arm then can be passing through so
in this model rather than living with

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700
in this model rather than living with
 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.630
in this model rather than living with
the self intersection I have cut a large

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640
the self intersection I have cut a large
 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.089
the self intersection I have cut a large
enough opening into the green body so I

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099
enough opening into the green body so I
 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.250
enough opening into the green body so I
can bring out the thin arm without

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260
can bring out the thin arm without
 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.470
can bring out the thin arm without
creating a self intersections but for

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480
creating a self intersections but for
 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.809
creating a self intersections but for
the price of creating an opening a

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819
the price of creating an opening a
 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.180
the price of creating an opening a
so-called puncture which has its own

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190
so-called puncture which has its own
 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.670
so-called puncture which has its own
border so this would still be a client

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680
border so this would still be a client
 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.039
border so this would still be a client
bottle but now it is a client bottle

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049
bottle but now it is a client bottle
 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.860
bottle but now it is a client bottle
this one puncture there's an important

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870
this one puncture there's an important
 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.500
this one puncture there's an important
message here and that means that simple

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510
message here and that means that simple
 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.629
message here and that means that simple
holes that you cut in a surface do not

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639
holes that you cut in a surface do not
 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.400
holes that you cut in a surface do not
change the type of surface for a

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410
change the type of surface for a
 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.830
change the type of surface for a
topologist even though this little thing

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840
topologist even though this little thing
 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.190
topologist even though this little thing
has a whole lot of little holes it would

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200
has a whole lot of little holes it would
 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.830
has a whole lot of little holes it would
still be considered a client bottle but

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840
still be considered a client bottle but
 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.830
still be considered a client bottle but
with many many many many many punctures

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840
with many many many many many punctures
 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.680
with many many many many many punctures
now from that point of view this little

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690
now from that point of view this little
 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.849
now from that point of view this little
cylinder is really just a sphere with

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859
cylinder is really just a sphere with
 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.879
cylinder is really just a sphere with
two punctures and this becomes a little

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889
two punctures and this becomes a little
 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.099
two punctures and this becomes a little
bit more obvious if you try to cap off

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109
bit more obvious if you try to cap off
 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.309
bit more obvious if you try to cap off
these openings so we put a cap on here

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319
these openings so we put a cap on here
 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.770
these openings so we put a cap on here
now it would be a sphere is only one

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780
now it would be a sphere is only one
 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.259
now it would be a sphere is only one
puncture and by the time I'm adding the

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269
puncture and by the time I'm adding the
 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.960
puncture and by the time I'm adding the
second cap it becomes of more obvious

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970
second cap it becomes of more obvious
 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.949
second cap it becomes of more obvious
that this is topologically just a sphere

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959
that this is topologically just a sphere
 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.210
that this is topologically just a sphere
there is a third number that is

there is a third number that is
 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.339
there is a third number that is
important for the classification of all

too many folds and that has to do with

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450
too many folds and that has to do with
 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.659
too many folds and that has to do with
the connectivity of the surface it's

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669
the connectivity of the surface it's
 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.690
the connectivity of the surface it's
called the genus of a surface a sphere

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700

genus 2 and here is a more complicated
 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.500
genus 2 and here is a more complicated
object and the surface of that would

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510
object and the surface of that would
 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.670

that surface that if you were to cut
 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.450

a circle loop into it then the inner
 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.990
a circle loop into it then the inner
part of that hole falls out and is

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000
part of that hole falls out and is
 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.870
part of that hole falls out and is
clearly no longer connected on the other

hand if I take my simple torus and I cut
 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.860
hand if I take my simple torus and I cut
along this red line then I simply get

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870
along this red line then I simply get
 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.520
along this red line then I simply get
some kind of you know tubing but it

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530
some kind of you know tubing but it
 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.160
some kind of you know tubing but it
still all hangs together so this is of

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170
still all hangs together so this is of
 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.730
still all hangs together so this is of
genus one because I draw one such line

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740
genus one because I draw one such line

if I had a two hole tourists I could

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870
if I had a two hole tourists I could
 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.160
if I had a two hole tourists I could
draw two such lines and I can cut along

draw two such lines and I can cut along
 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.780
draw two such lines and I can cut along
those and after both those cuts the

those and after both those cuts the
surface still all hangs together so

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710
surface still all hangs together so
 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.670
surface still all hangs together so
that's a surface of genus 2 if I take my

that's a surface of genus 2 if I take my

Mobius band and I'm cutting along that
 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.330

band will not fall apart now what do I

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840
band will not fall apart now what do I
 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.980

get I get a loop twice the size it has a

get I get a loop twice the size it has a
 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.370
get I get a loop twice the size it has a
twist of 360 degrees in it but it is

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380
twist of 360 degrees in it but it is
 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.130
twist of 360 degrees in it but it is
still in one piece and since I could do

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140
still in one piece and since I could do
 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.250
still in one piece and since I could do
one such cut that means that Mobius band

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:17.260
one such cut that means that Mobius band
 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.190
one such cut that means that Mobius band
had the genus of one try to cut it again

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200
had the genus of one try to cut it again
 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.560
had the genus of one try to cut it again
in the middle then it actually would

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570
in the middle then it actually would
 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.620
in the middle then it actually would
fall apart there's only one way of

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630
fall apart there's only one way of
 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.750
fall apart there's only one way of
cutting the Mobius band along a line and

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760
cutting the Mobius band along a line and
 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.390
cutting the Mobius band along a line and
then we're done to see whether it's not

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400
then we're done to see whether it's not
 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:36.259
then we're done to see whether it's not
perhaps genus 2 here

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:36.269
 
 

00:06:36.269 --> 00:06:42.219
 
now I've to individual pieces and I

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:42.229
now I've to individual pieces and I
 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:45.409
now I've to individual pieces and I
cannot get from one piece to the other

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419
cannot get from one piece to the other
 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:48.019
cannot get from one piece to the other
so the surface is no longer connected so

00:06:48.019 --> 00:06:48.029
so the surface is no longer connected so
 

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:50.600
so the surface is no longer connected so
clearly Mobius band is only genus one

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610
clearly Mobius band is only genus one
 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.790
clearly Mobius band is only genus one
the climb bottle is actually of genus

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800
the climb bottle is actually of genus
 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.279
the climb bottle is actually of genus
two and I've tried to indicate that by

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:55.289
two and I've tried to indicate that by
 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:58.399
two and I've tried to indicate that by
drawing two such lines which I could cut

00:06:58.399 --> 00:06:58.409
drawing two such lines which I could cut
 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:00.949
drawing two such lines which I could cut
along the red line on one side and the

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:00.959
along the red line on one side and the
 

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:03.199
along the red line on one side and the
green line on the other side and if I

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:03.209
green line on the other side and if I
 

00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:04.909
green line on the other side and if I
did that the surface would still be

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:04.919
did that the surface would still be
 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:05.719
did that the surface would still be
hanging together

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:05.729
hanging together
 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:08.899
hanging together
so the Klein bottle is a single sided

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:08.909
so the Klein bottle is a single sided
 

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:12.499
so the Klein bottle is a single sided
surface there's no borders and it is of

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:12.509
surface there's no borders and it is of
 

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:16.479
surface there's no borders and it is of
genus 2 now I would like to make better

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:16.489
genus 2 now I would like to make better
 

00:07:16.489 --> 00:07:20.509
genus 2 now I would like to make better
Klein bottles of a higher genus now how

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:20.519
Klein bottles of a higher genus now how
 

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:23.629
Klein bottles of a higher genus now how
could we do that I would like to build

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:23.639
could we do that I would like to build
 

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:25.909
could we do that I would like to build
these super Klein bottles in some

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919

modular way the first possible way of
 

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:29.949
modular way the first possible way of
making a module is what I'm showing here

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:29.959
making a module is what I'm showing here
 

00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:32.239
making a module is what I'm showing here
essentially taking the top half of the

still a two sided surface to make that

00:07:39.499 --> 00:07:39.509
still a two sided surface to make that
 

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:42.079
still a two sided surface to make that
clear I essentially painted the inside

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:42.089
clear I essentially painted the inside
 

00:07:42.089 --> 00:07:44.419
clear I essentially painted the inside
here in silver so the inside of this

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:44.429
here in silver so the inside of this
 

00:07:44.429 --> 00:07:46.969
here in silver so the inside of this
green toroidal body is silvery and then

00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:46.979
green toroidal body is silvery and then
 

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:49.189
green toroidal body is silvery and then
it is being brought out here in this

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199
it is being brought out here in this
 

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:52.040
it is being brought out here in this
silvery stem which by itself on the

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.050
silvery stem which by itself on the
 

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.439
silvery stem which by itself on the
inside is still green I want to use two

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:54.449
inside is still green I want to use two
 

00:07:54.449 --> 00:07:57.469
inside is still green I want to use two
of these modules to make my super Klein

00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:57.479
of these modules to make my super Klein
 

00:07:57.479 --> 00:07:59.629
of these modules to make my super Klein
bottle and I'm contemplating on

00:07:59.629 --> 00:07:59.639
bottle and I'm contemplating on
 

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:01.669
bottle and I'm contemplating on
essentially bringing together into a

00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:01.679
essentially bringing together into a
 

00:08:01.679 --> 00:08:03.439
essentially bringing together into a
ring and the neat these curved

00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:03.449
ring and the neat these curved
 

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:05.479
ring and the neat these curved
connectors but you can see if I try to

00:08:05.479 --> 00:08:05.489
connectors but you can see if I try to
 

00:08:05.489 --> 00:08:07.999
connectors but you can see if I try to
put them together like that then silver

00:08:07.999 --> 00:08:08.009
put them together like that then silver
 

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:10.699
put them together like that then silver
meets silver in the upper branch and

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:10.709
meets silver in the upper branch and
 

00:08:10.709 --> 00:08:12.949
meets silver in the upper branch and
green meets green in the lower branch

00:08:12.949 --> 00:08:12.959
green meets green in the lower branch
 

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:15.889
green meets green in the lower branch
and so I never really stepped from green

00:08:15.889 --> 00:08:15.899
and so I never really stepped from green
 

00:08:15.899 --> 00:08:18.559
and so I never really stepped from green
to silver and so that cannot possibly be

00:08:18.559 --> 00:08:18.569
to silver and so that cannot possibly be
 

00:08:18.569 --> 00:08:21.529
to silver and so that cannot possibly be
a single sided surface it's a perfectly

00:08:21.529 --> 00:08:21.539
a single sided surface it's a perfectly
 

00:08:21.539 --> 00:08:24.589
a single sided surface it's a perfectly
good you know two-sided surface ah but

00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:24.599
good you know two-sided surface ah but
 

00:08:24.599 --> 00:08:26.869
good you know two-sided surface ah but
what if I turn this thing around so

00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879
what if I turn this thing around so
 

00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:29.629
what if I turn this thing around so
maybe I want to connect it like that let

00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:29.639
maybe I want to connect it like that let
 

00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:32.480
maybe I want to connect it like that let
me actually try to do that some assembly

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:32.490
me actually try to do that some assembly
 

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:36.639
me actually try to do that some assembly
required so now I have created this

00:08:36.639 --> 00:08:36.649
required so now I have created this
 

00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:39.589
required so now I have created this
contraption and it looks good you know

00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:39.599
contraption and it looks good you know
 

00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:41.360
contraption and it looks good you know
I'm getting from green to silver over

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:41.370
I'm getting from green to silver over
 

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.939
I'm getting from green to silver over
this branch but then wait if I go

00:08:43.939 --> 00:08:43.949
this branch but then wait if I go
 

00:08:43.949 --> 00:08:46.730
this branch but then wait if I go
through lower branch I get once more a

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:46.740
through lower branch I get once more a
 

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.809
through lower branch I get once more a
green silver

00:08:48.809 --> 00:08:48.819
green silver
 

00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:51.989
green silver
and that means I have an even number of

00:08:51.989 --> 00:08:51.999
and that means I have an even number of
 

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:54.900
and that means I have an even number of
changes between the two surfaces and so

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:54.910
changes between the two surfaces and so
 

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.090
changes between the two surfaces and so
I'm not really getting a net

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:57.100
I'm not really getting a net
 

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.429
I'm not really getting a net
single-sided surface so again it's

00:08:59.429 --> 00:08:59.439
single-sided surface so again it's
 

00:08:59.439 --> 00:09:01.800
single-sided surface so again it's
two-sided that's disappointing maybe we

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:01.810
two-sided that's disappointing maybe we
 

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.900
two-sided that's disappointing maybe we
can put three of those into a loop so

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:03.910
can put three of those into a loop so
 

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.569
can put three of those into a loop so
here you can see a loop of three of

00:09:06.569 --> 00:09:06.579
here you can see a loop of three of
 

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:08.489
here you can see a loop of three of
those client bottles we have three

00:09:08.489 --> 00:09:08.499
those client bottles we have three
 

00:09:08.499 --> 00:09:10.799
those client bottles we have three
transitions clearly it's an odd number

00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:10.809
transitions clearly it's an odd number
 

00:09:10.809 --> 00:09:12.629
transitions clearly it's an odd number
of transitions between the surfaces so

00:09:12.629 --> 00:09:12.639
of transitions between the surfaces so
 

00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:14.429
of transitions between the surfaces so
the whole thing is single sided but if

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:14.439
the whole thing is single sided but if
 

00:09:14.439 --> 00:09:17.220
the whole thing is single sided but if
we analyze it in details we find that a

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:17.230
we analyze it in details we find that a
 

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.799
we analyze it in details we find that a

00:09:19.799 --> 00:09:19.809
genus is still only two so there's
 

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:21.269

around the corners of a cube frame but

around the corners of a cube frame but
even this special cube corner component

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:14.190
even this special cube corner component
 

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.490
even this special cube corner component
can be done in quite a few different

then I have made another module and here

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:22.440
then I have made another module and here
 

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.200
then I have made another module and here
here the third module and they all have

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:24.210
here the third module and they all have
 

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:26.150
here the third module and they all have
one thing in common the ends of the arms

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160
one thing in common the ends of the arms
 

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.330
one thing in common the ends of the arms
come out in three mutually perpendicular

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:29.340
come out in three mutually perpendicular
 

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.970
come out in three mutually perpendicular
directions and they all have the same

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:31.980
directions and they all have the same
 

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.550
directions and they all have the same
distance from the end of the arm to the

so they all can replace one another and

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.000
so they all can replace one another and
 

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.270
so they all can replace one another and
I put them in arbitrary ways around the

they're quite different but they're so

you can see here I'm branching out the

feeding out the thinner tube and then

you add Mobius bands together you can

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:02.050
you add Mobius bands together you can
 

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:04.650
you add Mobius bands together you can
increment the genus one by one so here

single sided surface of genus three now

00:15:58.930 --> 00:15:58.940
single sided surface of genus three now
 

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.090
single sided surface of genus three now
if you know that you want to make genus

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:01.100
if you know that you want to make genus
 

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.640
if you know that you want to make genus
seven what you need to do is find the

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:03.650
seven what you need to do is find the
 

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.160
seven what you need to do is find the
sphere drill seven holes into it and

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:06.170
sphere drill seven holes into it and
 

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:09.280
sphere drill seven holes into it and
then simply graft one of these punctured

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:09.290
then simply graft one of these punctured
 

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:12.100
then simply graft one of these punctured
mobile strips on each one of the seven

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:12.110
mobile strips on each one of the seven
 

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.900
mobile strips on each one of the seven
holes and voila

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:13.910
holes and voila
 

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.850
holes and voila
you get yourself a change of seven

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:15.860
you get yourself a change of seven
 

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.490
you get yourself a change of seven
single sided surface and this works for

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:18.500
single sided surface and this works for
 

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.949
single sided surface and this works for
any positive integer number

00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959
 
 

00:16:22.959 --> 00:16:24.030
 
what are you doing for breakfast

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:24.040
what are you doing for breakfast
 

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.220
what are you doing for breakfast
something sort of Swiss Oh

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:26.230
something sort of Swiss Oh
 

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:29.400
something sort of Swiss Oh
seven or eight Klein bottles breakfast

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:29.410
seven or eight Klein bottles breakfast
 

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:32.040
seven or eight Klein bottles breakfast
you know like bagels you know this Klein

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:32.050
you know like bagels you know this Klein
 

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:34.799
you know like bagels you know this Klein
bottle oh so much tastier well they take

00:16:34.799 --> 00:16:34.809
bottle oh so much tastier well they take
 

00:16:34.809 --> 00:16:37.049
bottle oh so much tastier well they take
it HS fast because he digests from the

00:16:37.049 --> 00:16:37.059
it HS fast because he digests from the
 

00:16:37.059 --> 00:16:39.779
it HS fast because he digests from the
inside and from the outside
