00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.120
Let's do some more work with
rational expressions.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:13.650
So let's say I had a squared
plus 2ab plus b squared and

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:22.980
all of that is over ab squared
minus a squared b.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.480
And we're going to take this
and divide it by a plus b.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.580
So the first thing we might want
to do is just factor this

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.240
numerator and this
denominator, and

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.170
then we could divide.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.420
Or actually, we could
go the other way.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.980
We could divide and
then factor.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.630
So if we divide and then factor,
we could say, well,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.350
this is the same thing.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.070
This is equal to this
whole expression.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.300
Let me just copy and paste it.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.060
That's probably the easiest
thing to do.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.640
Copy and then paste it.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.710
It's equal to that expression
times the inverse of this.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.870
If I divide by something,
that's the same thing as

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.990
multiplying by the inverse,
as multiplying by

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.190
1 over a plus b.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.640
And this is just going to be the
same thing as that with a

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.550
plus b in the denominator,
because your numerator's going

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.790
to be that times 1, which
is just that.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.490
Your denominator is going to be
ab squared minus a squared

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.090
b times a plus b, so that
times a plus b.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.910
So this would be a legitimate
answer, but I have a suspicion

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.400
that this can be further
simplified.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.530
So let's see if we
can simplify it.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.510
So our numerator, a squared plus
2 ab plus b squared, you

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.850
might recognize that.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.590
That is a perfect square.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.860
That is our numerator.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.810
Let me color code it.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.440
So that numerator right there,
that is the same thing as a

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.420
plus b squared, or a plus b
times a plus b, because you

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.270
have a squared, you have a b
squared, and then you have 2

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.430
times a and b right
in the middle.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.470
That is a perfect square.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.240
Multiply it out if you
don't believe me.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.180
So that numerator is
that right there.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.930
And then the denominator,
what is this?

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.280
Well, what happens if we factor
out an ab down here?

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.980
Let's factor out an ab.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.600
So ab squared divided by ab, a
cancels out, you're just left

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.240
with ab, right? ab times b is
ab squared, and then minus a

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.580
squared b divided
by ab is just a.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.030
This right here is the
same thing as that.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.820
And you can multiply it out.
ab times negative a is

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.200
negative a squared b.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.380
You got that right there.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.150
So multiply it out.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.760
You should get this
right there.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.570
And, of course, you also have
your a plus b sitting here.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.970
Now, we have an a plus b squared
in the numerator, we

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.420
have an a plus b into the
denominator, or we could say a

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.320
plus b to the first power.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.060
And then we know our exponent
rules here.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.270
We can just essentially cancel
out an a plus b in the

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.490
numerator and the denominator,
which decrements this exponent

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.180
by 1, so this just
becomes a 1.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.850
And then this becomes a zero,
or it cancels out.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:37.010
And so we get this is being
equal to a plus b over ab

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.250
times b minus a with the caveat
because we canceled

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.390
this thing out in
the denominator.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.150
We have to say, look, this thing
could still not equal

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.870
zero, because this
will still make

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.080
this expression undefined.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.000
We have to say the only way that
this is going to be equal

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.580
to zero is if we subtract b from
both sides, a is equal to

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.710
negative b.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.160
So we have to add the caveat
that a cannot be equal to

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.820
negative b.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.270
We have to add this condition.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.210
So this is our answer.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.690
Let's do another one.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:19.180
Let's say I have-- let's do a
more involved one, just to

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.540
really get our juices flowing.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:32.210
Let's say we have x squared plus
8x plus 16 divided by, or

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:50.120
over, 7x squared plus 9x plus 2
divided by 7x over 4 over x

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.020
squared plus 4x.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.000
So what is this going
to be equal to?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.100
So here we could divide first.
That's the same thing as

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.420
multiplying by the inverse
of this thing.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.155
But just for fun, let's factor
these two, the numerator and

00:05:04.155 --> 00:05:05.990
the denominator here.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.730
So this numerator over here,
that's pretty straightforward.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.960
That is a perfect square.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.660
That is x plus 4 squared.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.400
4 times 4 is 16.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.860
4 plus 4 is 8.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:22.720
So our numerator is
x plus 4 squared.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.370
And then our denominator,
what does that become?

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.930
Here, we're going to have to do
a little bit of grouping to

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.360
factor that out.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.750
So we have 7x squared
plus 9x plus 2.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.810
We have to find two numbers.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.700
When I multiply them, I get 7
times 2, which is equal to 14.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.050
And when I add them, a
plus b, they equal 9.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.960
And the easiest two numbers
are 7 and 2.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.480
So let's rewrite this.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.720
This is the same thing as 7x
squared-- I'll group the 7x

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.780
with the 7 because they have a
common factor of 7-- plus 7x

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.055
plus 2x plus 2.

00:06:02.055 --> 00:06:05.260
I put parentheses around there
so you can see the grouping.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:11.140
Factor out a 7x over here, you
get 7x times x plus 1 plus--

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.280
factor out a 2 here.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:26.240
2 times x plus 1, and you get 7x
plus 2 times your x plus 1.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.010
We're undistributing
that expression.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.710
So this is our denominator
right there.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.880
And actually, I just realized
that I made a slight error

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.520
when I wrote down
this problem.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.330
The numerator here is actually
7x plus 2, lucky for us.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.820
Obviously, this is going to
lead to interesting things

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.550
later on, potentially.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.480
So let's see what we get.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.250
And actually, I think
there's a typo here.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.330
I think this is supposed to be
a 4x-- oh, sorry, just a 4.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.150
So let me just put it like that
just in case that is a

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.850
typo because I think it's
going to make it more

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:01.400
interesting.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.790
So that's our original
problem.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.380
We haven't messed with this part
yet, so it won't change

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.390
any of our math.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.020
But so far, we factored
this bottom part.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:14.600
We factored this bottom part
using grouping as 7x plus 2

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.780
times x plus 1.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.050
And so this expression is the
exact same thing as this

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.650
expression over here, and we're
going to divide it by

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.180
that expression.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.200
So dividing by that expression,
that is the same

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.360
exact thing as multiplying
by the inverse of this

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.290
expression.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:35.850
Actually, you know what?

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.750
I just realized that it wasn't
x squared plus 4x.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.010
I just saw the problem.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.680
That is an x squared plus 4x.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.560
This was the original problem.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.370
Sorry for all that.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.860
We haven't done any work
here so it's all cool.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.890
So this right over here,
multiplying by the inverse of

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:54.350
this, we multiply-- dividing by
this is the same thing as

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.240
multiplying by the inverse, so
we just flip the numerator and

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.120
the denominator.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:08.080
So x squared plus 4x
over 7x plus 2.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.120
And then another thing we can
do, if we look at this up

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.060
here, we can factor out an x.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.380
So this right here, if we factor
out an x is the same

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:19.180
thing as x times x plus 4.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.080
So if we do all of the
multiplication, what does our

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:21.920
numerator become?

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:28.840
We have x-- I'll use a new
color-- we have x plus 4

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.809
squared times x times
x plus 4.

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:36.130
That is our numerator.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:44.530
And our denominator is 7x plus
2 times another 7x plus 2

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.890
times an x plus 1.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:50.170
So here nothing is canceling
out, but we have the same term

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.186
being multiplied
multiple times.

00:08:52.186 --> 00:08:55.680
x to the fourth squared times
x to the fourth to the first

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.610
power, this is going to be equal
to-- we still have our x

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:03.450
out front, so it's x times x
plus 4, we could say to the

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:08.480
third power, all of that over--
we have two 7x's plus

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:16.290
2, so 7x plus 2 squared
times x plus 1.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.020
And we are done!
