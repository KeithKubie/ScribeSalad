00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
just asked that with everything and
 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.350 align:start position:0%
just asked that with everything and
probably<00:03:03.150><c> rightfully</c><00:03:03.720><c> so</c><00:03:03.930><c> but</c><00:03:04.940><c> but</c><00:03:05.940><c> now</c><00:03:06.150><c> it's</c>

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
probably rightfully so but but now it's
 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.090 align:start position:0%
probably rightfully so but but now it's
just<00:03:06.450><c> ruined</c><00:03:06.989><c> to</c><00:03:07.050><c> be</c><00:03:07.200><c> because</c><00:03:07.620><c> I</c><00:03:07.770><c> can</c><00:03:07.950><c> see</c>

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 align:start position:0%
just ruined to be because I can see
 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.620 align:start position:0%
just ruined to be because I can see
something<00:03:08.459><c> as</c><00:03:08.580><c> awesome</c><00:03:08.820><c> as</c><00:03:09.180><c> this</c><00:03:09.360><c> and</c>

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 align:start position:0%
something as awesome as this and
 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.550 align:start position:0%
something as awesome as this and
question<00:03:09.930><c> why</c><00:03:10.140><c> um</c><00:03:11.450><c> it's</c><00:03:12.450><c> all</c><00:03:12.750><c> I'm</c><00:03:12.900><c> really</c><00:03:13.110><c> torn</c>

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
question why um it's all I'm really torn
 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.720 align:start position:0%
question why um it's all I'm really torn
on<00:03:13.739><c> it</c><00:03:14.010><c> I</c><00:03:14.209><c> guess</c><00:03:15.209><c> maybe</c><00:03:15.890><c> if</c><00:03:16.890><c> they</c><00:03:17.190><c> write</c><00:03:17.519><c> it</c>

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 align:start position:0%
on it I guess maybe if they write it
 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.699 align:start position:0%
on it I guess maybe if they write it
back<00:03:17.970><c> in</c><00:03:18.269><c> or</c><00:03:18.570><c> they're</c><00:03:18.720><c> they</c><00:03:18.989><c> work</c><00:03:19.410><c> it</c><00:03:19.560><c> all</c>

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 align:start position:0%
back in or they're they work it all
 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.900 align:start position:0%
back in or they're they work it all
together<00:03:20.239><c> maybe</c><00:03:21.239><c> up</c><00:03:22.370><c> but</c><00:03:23.370><c> I</c><00:03:23.400><c> don't</c><00:03:23.610><c> see</c><00:03:23.760><c> how</c><00:03:23.880><c> I</c>

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 align:start position:0%
together maybe up but I don't see how I
 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.990 align:start position:0%
together maybe up but I don't see how I
could<00:03:24.090><c> it</c><00:03:24.480><c> doesn't</c><00:03:24.780><c> seem</c><00:03:24.930><c> like</c><00:03:25.080><c> anyone</c>

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
could it doesn't seem like anyone
 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.180 align:start position:0%
could it doesn't seem like anyone
learned<00:03:27.000><c> anything</c><00:03:27.420><c> or</c><00:03:27.870><c> evolved</c><00:03:28.320><c> to</c><00:03:28.709><c> anything</c>

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 align:start position:0%
learned anything or evolved to anything
 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
learned anything or evolved to anything
uh<00:03:29.580><c> I</c><00:03:30.150><c> mean</c><00:03:30.480><c> again</c><00:03:30.870><c> he</c><00:03:30.989><c> gets</c><00:03:31.170><c> a</c><00:03:31.290><c> nice</c><00:03:31.730><c> technique</c>

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 align:start position:0%
uh I mean again he gets a nice technique
 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.699 align:start position:0%
uh I mean again he gets a nice technique
and<00:03:33.000><c> philosophy</c><00:03:33.600><c> like</c><00:03:33.930><c> about</c><00:03:34.290><c> you</c><00:03:34.440><c> know</c><00:03:34.560><c> the</c>

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
grand scheme of things I'm wondering if
 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.220 align:start position:0%
grand scheme of things I'm wondering if
it<00:03:45.450><c> adds</c><00:03:45.600><c> up</c><00:03:45.780><c> to</c><00:03:45.840><c> anything</c><00:03:46.350><c> uh</c><00:03:47.870><c> maybe</c><00:03:48.870><c> we'll</c>

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 align:start position:0%
it adds up to anything uh maybe we'll
 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
it adds up to anything uh maybe we'll
maybe<00:03:50.190><c> somewhere</c><00:03:51.090><c> it'll</c><00:03:51.989><c> tie</c><00:03:52.260><c> back</c><00:03:52.590><c> in</c><00:03:52.890><c> but</c><00:03:53.190><c> as</c>

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 align:start position:0%
maybe somewhere it'll tie back in but as
 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.819 align:start position:0%
maybe somewhere it'll tie back in but as
of<00:03:53.880><c> now</c><00:03:54.030><c> I'm</c><00:03:54.239><c> just</c><00:03:54.480><c> like</c><00:03:54.750><c> that</c><00:03:55.260><c> was</c><00:03:55.470><c> the</c><00:03:55.620><c> most</c>

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 align:start position:0%
of now I'm just like that was the most
 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.490 align:start position:0%
of now I'm just like that was the most

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:03.740 align:start position:0%
well we'll see where that goes but like
 

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.319 align:start position:0%
well we'll see where that goes but like
I<00:09:03.769><c> said</c><00:09:04.070><c> it</c><00:09:04.130><c> could</c><00:09:04.250><c> be</c><00:09:04.370><c> totally</c><00:09:04.579><c> wrong</c><00:09:04.730><c> could</c>
