00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.830
Edgar Choueiri: My name is
Edgar Choueiri, and I'm a

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.820
professor of mechanical and
aerospace engineering here at

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:17.890
Princton University.


00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.060
Recently, I have been involved
academically in acoustics.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.610
3-D sound is for you to sit in
front some speakers, ideally

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.130
two loud speakers only, and be
able to play an orchestra or

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.730
ensemble or a band, and be able
to locate unambiguously

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.250
the location of each
sound source.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.360
You have a choir, you
can point to every

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.390
person in the choir.


00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.470
If you have a symphony
orchestra, you can see the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.250
viola coming from here, or
the base coming all the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.310
way from the right.


00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:47.230
In other words, a 3-D audio
image of that event.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.850
Quite often people ask me, how
is that different from

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.830
surround sound?


00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.050
Surround sound is just a way
to get you enveloped in the

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.820
sound, which works fine if
you're watching an action

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.710
movie with a lot of explosions
around you.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.470
It doesn't attempt to
reconstruct 3-D audio image.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.070
For example, if you want to
portray somebody walking to

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.330
the listener and whispering in
their ear, you can never do

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.440
that with surround sound,
because the sound is always at

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.040
the speakers.


00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.130
But with 3-D audio, I can get a
fly to circle your head from

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.380
two loudspeakers.


00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:24.970
[fly buzzing]

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.080
The first goal of my work in
this lab is to fundamentally

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.700
understand how humans
locate sound in 3-D.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.070
If you are in a concert hall,
and somebody makes a sound

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.510
from the right part of the
concert hall, even if your

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.270
eyes are closed, you can tell
that that person is standing

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.700
all the way to the
right-hand side.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.790
The brain can tell, because it
receives three kinds of cues.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.610
The first kind of cue is simply
the time it takes for

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.740
the sound to get to your right
ear is slightly shorter than

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.070
the time it takes for the sound
to reach your left ear.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.850
That time difference between the
two ears is enough for the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.110
brain to analyze very quickly
and realize that the sound

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.060
must be coming from the right,
and not from the left.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.890
The second kind of cue is that
sound, as it travels from the

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.510
source, when it hits
your right ear, it

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.380
has a certain level.


00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.020
By the time it hits your left
ear, it has a lower level.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.250
So to record in 3-D for
loudspeakers, all we need is

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.760
two microphones.


00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.360
If the microphones are placed
inside the ears of a dummy

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.600
head, the microphones record the
correct 3-D cues needed for

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.720
humans to hear in 3-D.


00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.750
The trick is in the playback.


00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.010
The reason you don't hear in 3-D
through normal speakers is

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.740
that the left speaker contains
the 3-D cues for your left ear,

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.390
and the right speaker
for your right ear.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.260
But these cues get corrupted
when your left ear hears the

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.020
right speaker, and your right
ear hears the left speaker.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.380
This is called cross talk.


00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.040
And without cancelling the cross
talk, the cues get mixed

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.940
up and your brain won't get the
information it needs to

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.510
hear in 3-D.


00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.180
We need to now take what is on
the right channel, make it go

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.330
to the right ear, in the left
channel, make it go out to the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.510
left ear, essentially
putting a wall

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.110
between the two speakers.


00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.240
By sending negative and positive
pressure waves from

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.170
each speaker, my filter does
that so that the left speaker

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.330
sound never reaches the right
ear and vice versa.
