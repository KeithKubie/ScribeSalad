of our generated classes you should use

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200
of our generated classes you should use
 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.930

the developer console to register an ID

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940
the developer console to register an ID
 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.830
the developer console to register an ID
and use that value here

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840
 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.140
easy enough we'll save and exit

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150
easy enough we'll save and exit
 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.270

so just to quickly recap we only made

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280
so just to quickly recap we only made
 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.600
so just to quickly recap we only made
these two changes

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610
 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.150
now to run this back-end locally we will

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160
now to run this back-end locally we will
 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.220
now to run this back-end locally we will
invoke it via maven in this command

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230
invoke it via maven in this command
 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.470

the dev server command is running it on
 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.790
the dev server command is running it on
a local dev server you should know the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800
a local dev server you should know the
 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.080
a local dev server you should know the
first time you run this command on a

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090
first time you run this command on a
 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.790
first time you run this command on a
machine it will take a little bit longer

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800
machine it will take a little bit longer
 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.980
