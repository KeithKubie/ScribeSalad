00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.080
In this session we saw two
important Ruby data structures,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.410
the array and the hash.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.530
Arrays are ordered lists of data,

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.080
while hashes is our
collections of key value pairs.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.565
We'll use these two structures in
pretty much everything we tackle from

00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:16.200
here on out.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.890
It's also very common to use them
together, storing arrays and

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.810
hashes or hashes and arrays.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.780
We'll see an example of
this in our next project

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.820
where we analyze some complex product
sales data for a fictitious company.
