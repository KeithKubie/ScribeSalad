00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.380
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: OK.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.000
Welcome back, everyone.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.350
We are going to start session
five, the last session of the day.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.460
This session is on
permanent exemptions.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.480
And I'll just read the description.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.650 position:56%
This session will explore the
necessity, relevance and sufficiency

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.880
of the permanent exemptions to
the prohibition on circumvention

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.000 position:56%
and will consider whether amendments

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.650
or additional exemption
categories may be advisable.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.580
So to get started, I'd just like
to ask the panelists once again

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.350
to introduce themselves and
along with their affiliation.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.950
Thank you.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.870
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: And a
proud alum of our office.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.220
So, welcome all.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.320
So I thought we would proceed sort
of in two parts, first by looking

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.790
at the adequacy and
the functionality

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.500
of the current exemptions
and then turning to proposals

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.100
for additional permanent
exemptions and to get your thoughts

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.360
on whether any may be
necessary or advisable.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.020
We're thinking of proceeding
a little bit differently

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.590
in this session.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.710
As you know, a lot of the existing
permanent exemptions are specific

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.290
to particular types of uses and are
maybe more relevant to particular--

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.330
to certain of you than others.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.170
So we may direct questions
specifically to individual people

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.460
to start out with, but everyone
obviously is welcome to weigh in

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.770
and in fact, we, you know,
we encourage you to do so.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.090
So I wanted to start by talking

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.540
about the library exemption
under Section 1201(d).

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.110
We received a number of
comments on this exemption

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.130
from library associations.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.090
I think the word useless came
up in one or two of them.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.310
And so, if I could direct
this to you, Ms. Cox,

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.540 position:56%
I just would be interested just sort
of generally in your perspective

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.280
on the current library exemption,
you know, if you could sort

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.430
of elaborate on why it may
not be as useful as hoped,

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.830
and any changes you
would like to see.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.370
&gt;&gt; Krista L. Cox: Well,
I certainly think

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.050
that Section 1201(d) is not very
useful for libraries, archives

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.380
and educational institutions.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.060
It's not actually an
exemption that we asked

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:56.890 position:56%
for in the DMCA legislative hearings
and that whole process because it's

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.190
so narrowly drafted,
it's not an exemption

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.860
for any nonprofit library
or educational use.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.840
It's not even an exemption for
any library or educational use

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.670
that is already granted
under, you know, Section 108

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.180
or granted under fair use.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.100
It's so narrowly tailored to
only acquisition decisions.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.980
And you can only use that
exemption for the time necessary

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.600
for an acquisition decision.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.140
And it is our view that if
we are going out and looking

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.220 position:56%
to make an acquisition, that whoever
is selling that book or that product

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.910
to us would be happy to open
up that digital lock for us

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.390
to make that determination.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:45.080 position:56%
We find that we are constantly using
every three years the rulemaking

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.690
process to pursue the exemptions
that we think are really necessary,

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.650
for example, to-- for
assistive technologies for those

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.090 position:56%
that are blind, visually impaired or
print-disabled, for educational uses

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.100
of audiovisual materials.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.020
So for us, those are the types
of uses that we would find--

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.680
that we need continually and that
would warrant a permanent exemption

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.740
versus the very narrow
exemption in 1201(d).

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.040
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.410
And so, just sort of in practice,
I mean, in your experience,

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.090
is the current exemption-- I mean,
it sounds like the answer is no.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.940
Do you know of many examples

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.720
of librarians making
use of that exemption?

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.250
&gt;&gt; Krista L. Cox: I don't, because
I don't know of content providers

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.160
who hand something over to
a library locked and say,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.990
do you want this product,
it's locked.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.380
No, I mean, it just-- for
purposes of acquisitions,

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.470
normally the content providers
are happy to unlock it for us

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.410 position:56%
as we make a decision in purchasing.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.710
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: OK.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.010
Now-- Oh, sorry.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.310
Go ahead.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.610
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Can I ask what are
your thoughts about reforming it

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.260
to track the contours of 108
which is different, I will say,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.450
than some of the petitions for
exemptions in the rulemaking.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.160
&gt;&gt; Krista L. Cox: I think that--

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.540
I mean, I think that
there are certainly areas

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:16.820
where it would be useful
to amend 1201 in order

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.920
to accommodate what's
allowed under 108.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:27.530
But there are, of course, other
uses as well that we would support.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:28.830
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Oh, sorry.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.920
So-- Well yeah, so I think
that was one proposal.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.590
I mean, I know in our comments
from the American Association

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.650
of Law Libraries, there
was a recommendation

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.650
that a permanent exemption
be created for any use

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.080
that was permissible under 108.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.840
I assume-- Is that something
that you're recommending as well

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.280
or do you think that the,
you know, the exemptions

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.060
that you've petitioned
for pertaining

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.970
to motion pictures are sort
of a more pressing concern?

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.980
&gt;&gt; Krista L. Cox: Can we have both?

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.650
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Well--

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:07.950
&gt;&gt; Krista L. Cox: No.

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:09.250
I mean, yes.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.090
I think that, you know, having--

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:17.610
expanding it to apply to Section
108 would be very, very helpful.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.440
And, you know, I think this just
highlights a fundamental flaw

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.880
of the 1201 process that,
you know, has been talked

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.810
about in these roundtables, that
it's not linked to infringement.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.110
And it's, you know, from the
perspective of our libraries,

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:35.530
who really do want to follow the
law and, you know, ensure that--

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.260
simultaneously ensuring that
we are fulfilling our mission,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.170
that it doesn't really make sense
to have these exemptions granted

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.930
under Section 108 or be
allowed under fair use.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.230
But then, you can't
actually do it just

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:47.850
because we've moved
into a digital world.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.510
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Are there
any other views on sort

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.560
of the advisability
of-- oh, I'm sorry.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.010
I didn't even see.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.540
Mr. Williams?

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:06.040
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.340
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: We're mic-less.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.640
&gt;&gt; Matt Williams: Oh,
mine just came on.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.940
OK, great.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.240
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: OK.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.540
&gt;&gt; Matt Williams: Thank you.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:17.200
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Oh yeah, if we could
just ask if you're not speaking

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.170
to turn off your microphone?

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.340
Thank you.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.730
&gt;&gt; Matt Williams: Thank you.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.990 position:56%
I did see that the library community
is not finding the existing

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:28.400
exemption helpful.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.160
And it sounds to me like that's

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.620
because the market is
working really well.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:35.710
As she said, copyright
owners are more than willing

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:40.490
to give test access to libraries
so that they can sample the works

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:41.790
and decide whether to buy them.

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:46.900
So, I think that's a good news
story, not a bad news story

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.840
that we need to worry about.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:56.980
I, in the comments, saw that in
replace of the permanent exemption,

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.300 position:56%
what the libraries seem to be asking

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.190
for is all non-infringing
uses exemption.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.350
And we've talked in other
panels about why there are a lot

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.340
of dangers associated with
those types of proposals

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:12.580
and why 1201(a) was designed not

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:18.230
to necessarily protect only
exclusive rights under section 106,

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:22.700
but also to provide a right of
access that is very important

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.050
and that needs to be preserved.

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:30.470
When you get to the slightly
narrower approach of just--

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:37.340
for 108 covered uses, I doubt
that that is going to go very far

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.560
in terms of reducing the number
of exemptions that libraries seek

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:46.710
because what I often read,
at least, is that libraries

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:50.540 position:56%
and others are unhappy with the
scope of 108 as it currently exists.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:54.500
And so, they would rather point to
Section 107 for most of the things

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.760
that they want to do, in which
case you either get back to a kind

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:04.370
of pseudo all non-infringement
uses-type of approach or you end

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.740
up needing, even if you
cover all 108 activity,

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.290
for people to come back every
three years and make new requests.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:15.000
So, I'm not sure that that would
have a very effective impact.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.170
I think what will have a
more effective impact is

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.660
that if the more streamlined
approach to renewals

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:25.810
that was discussed yesterday is
adopted in some workable format,

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:29.410
the need to make permanent
these types

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:32.530
of exemptions becomes
a lot less important

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:36.010
and you actually preserve the
ability to have some confidence

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:39.040
of renewal, but you also
preserve the flexibility

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.860 position:56%
of having the rulemaking there so
that if someone needs something new,

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:46.130
they don't have to go all
the way back to Congress.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:47.960
Again, they can come to you.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.260
Thanks.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.560
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.050
Ms. Besek?

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.650
&gt;&gt; June Besek: Well, specifically
with respect to an exception

00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:04.840 position:56%
for 108 activities, I can't help but
wonder why the libraries need it now

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:10.120 position:56%
when they haven't made such a
request, not necessarily with regard

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.480 position:56%
to all 108-- specific 108 activities
over the last several years.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.640
It seems to me that if the
structure were that deficient,

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.200
they would have consistently asked

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.760
for that exemption,
and it's not there.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.280
So I'm not sure there's
really a basis.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.890
The second point I want to make
is I think Section 108 is broader

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.130
than people might realize.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:32.480
I was on the Section 108
group, as were others here.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.920
And, you know, it gives libraries
a fair amount of flexibility

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.690
with respect to providing
copies for users, for example.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:44.030
And so, I don't think
that we should assume

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.030
that that would be
a narrow exception.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:49.940
And I think without-- I
think it is really akin

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:54.300 position:56%
to the no non-infringing uses, you
know, rather that you should be able

00:11:54.300 --> 00:12:00.080
to circumvent for any
non-infringing use or any fair use.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.860
I think it falls in that
category and I would be reluctant

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.590
to see that without more.

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:05.890
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.320
Ms. Cox, would you like
to respond to that?

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.450 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Krista L. Cox: So of course, the
libraries-- Mr. Williams is correct,

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:13.500
we do support the Unlocking
Technology Act,

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.490
which would tie infringement
to circumvention.

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:22.120
But as a next best option, you
know, we do very much believe

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.660
that permanent exemptions are
warranted in certain cases.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.460
For example, for assistive
technologies for the blind,

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.960
library services, authorized
entities that, you know,

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:34.010
were often providing
accessible formats for the blind,

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:40.020
also for the audiovisual exceptions
for educators and students

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.040
at our colleges and universities,
for K through 12 educators.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.800
These are all exemptions that
we have supported in the past.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:51.520
And in the most recent rulemaking
cycle, the NTIA recommendation

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.930
to the Register in that report said
that they acknowledge the concerns

00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:02.090
by the rights holders who oppose
these exemptions, but that,

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:03.390
you know, that emphasizing

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:06.800
that these exemptions don't
legalize copyright infringement

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.530
and that the record doesn't
show that the previous grants

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:11.200
of similar exceptions
have led to piracy.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.030
So I think in those cases,
it makes a lot of sense

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.400
to move towards a permanent
exemption,

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:21.910
to expand our current 1201(d)
exemption to include the activities

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:25.680
that are really important
to us, like these exemptions

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.980
that we request every time.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:33.040
I think the Library Copyright
Alliance joined four different

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.650
proposals for exemptions
for audiovisual classes

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.330
in this past rulemaking cycle.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:44.270
And, you know, it seems like
that that just keeps expanding.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:47.870
And so, I think having a permanent
exemption that is broad enough

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:51.650
to cover these areas would make a
lot more sense than us having to go

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.990
through this every time, especially
when there isn't any evidence

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:58.280
that infringement occurs
in having these exemptions.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.520
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Can you
speak to Mr. Williams' point

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.720
that perhaps streamlining the
renewal would serve a great deal

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.150
of your concerns, while still
sort of leaving the door open

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.630
in case there were changed
circumstances in the market

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.570
or something or some reason,
you know, to sort of not etch it

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:16.200
in statutory stone
and make it permanent?

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.070
Could you live with that instead?

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:19.370
&gt;&gt; Krista L. Cox: Well,
I certainly think

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.670
that streamlining the
process would of course help.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.590
But I would have to
see what the contours

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:27.740
of that streamlined process would
look like because, you know,

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.740
previous rulemaking
cycles, of course,

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.580
were I think much less
involved than they are today,

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.060
where you have a 400-page report
from the Copyright Office.

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.830
I think that if there is
a, you know, presumption of

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:43.440
or an automatic renewal
unless there is evidence

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.550
of changed circumstances, that
would certainly be helpful.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.720
But what would be even
better, of course,

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.160
is that if there's a permanent
exemption where, you know,

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.780
time and time again, the Copyright
Office is granting exemptions

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:59.410
for persons who are blind
or disabled, for educators

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:00.770
and educational institutions,

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.330
for students in college
and universities.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.430
I think where there's
strong evidence

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:09.750 position:56%
that there has not been infringement
as a results of these exemptions,

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:13.550
it just makes sense to
make them permanent.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:14.850
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:18.270
Could I just follow up
on the 108 question?

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:22.830
We received some comments
that talked about the need

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:26.770
to circumvent for-- of libraries
to circumvent for, for example,

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:31.940
preservation purposes and
they used the example of works

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:37.240
in obsolete format, which may
include TPMs in obsolete format.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.240
I'm just wondering if you could
sort of elaborate on that.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.800
And I wasn't totally clear
whether that sort of issue goes

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.330
to access controls or whether
the issue is copy controls.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.510
In other words, if
you have, you know,

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:57.150
if a library receives a collection
of VHS tapes or something,

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:59.160
is the issue with respect
to preservation

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.350
that the library can't access
the works or is it more

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:05.520
that there is a copy control

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:09.290
which would prevent
you from digitizing it?

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:10.590
&gt;&gt; Krista L. Cox: Well,
I think with the VHS,

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:12.790
it would be a copy
control mechanism,

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:15.410
not an access control mechanism.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:19.350
I think my colleague, Brandon
Butler, who actually works

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:24.600
in a library may have more
information on this issue.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.900
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: OK.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.200
OK. No, that's fine.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.800
Well, Mr. Dow?

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.100
&gt;&gt; Troy Dow: Thank you.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.400
So, just a couple of points.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.620
I served with June on
the Section 108 Committee

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:38.560
and I had a similar reaction to the
proposal that there'd be some sort

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.670
of exception that would apply to
Section 108 covered activities

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.610
and that they apply to such
a broad range of activities,

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:47.450 position:56%
including things like
interlibrary loan, copies for users.

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:49.930
I know that in the course
of our discussions there

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:53.130
in the Section 108 group, we
talked extensively about the fact

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:57.820
that copies for users for
private study was contemplated

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.240
by many libraries to include
loaning of materials and providing

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:04.030
of materials for personal review,
including the loaning of movies

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:05.930
and things like that
for personal review.

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:07.720
And so, the notion that
you would have an exemption

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.480
that would allow you to
circumvent copy protection,

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:15.310
to provide unencrypted copies
of expressive works as part

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:17.410
of interlibrary loan
or as part of copies

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:20.140
for users I think would
be of concern to us.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:25.130
On the issue of not having
evidence of infringement,

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:28.680
one of the concerns throughout
even with rulemaking processes,

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.440
it's very, very difficult to tie
resulting acts of infringement

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.420
to the particular uses that
are being made pursuant

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.720
to the exemptions, right?

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.160
And so, if you have an exemption
to allow people to make copies

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.290
for a variety of uses,
tying then downstream--

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:45.390
if the result is that that
allows for circumvention

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:49.420
to release unencrypted copies
of works then it's very hard

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.930
to tie the downstream
copies of unencrypted copies

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:53.720
to the first initial
copy that was made.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.620
So, while there's not an abundance
of information in the record

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:01.710 position:56%
to show infringements, it's actually
really hard to say what the impact

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:03.430
of that is in the marketplace.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:07.160
The last thing I'll say is
that in terms of Section 108,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.540
the other thing that
I think we learned

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.250
in that process was it's very--

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.840
that's a section that is
sort of technologically

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.840
and marketplace-dependent.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.200
And part of the reason we
were gathered together to talk

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.410 position:56%
about Section 108 was because
technology had eclipsed the statute.

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:22.200
And Congress had attempted
to make some updates

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.500
in the context of the DMCA.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.510
And even those updates have been
eclipsed by time and by technology.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:28.440
And so, I think in
that sort of context,

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.810
in the types of things you're
talking about in 108 for things

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:34.940 position:56%
like preservation, there's a benefit
to having a rulemaking process

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.110
that can respond to those
changes in the marketplace,

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.920
to the specific technologies
that are being used,

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.230 position:56%
to the specific concerns about what
the impact of allowing circumvention

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:43.530
in those circumstances would be,

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.710
that would not only
streamlined access

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:48.140
to those exemptions along the
lines that were discussed but also

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.450
to have exemptions that are
tailored to the particular needs

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:52.800
and to the particular concerns and
much better than you would be able

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.380
to do with a permanent exception

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:55.950
that you might find
yourself looking at,

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:59.920
very much like 108,becomes
quickly outdated.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.220
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.520
Mr. Love?

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:09.570
&gt;&gt; James Love: Thank you very much.

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:14.900
If the permanent exceptions are by
statute only and the statute sort

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.280
of sets out all the conditions,
I think that the problem

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.840
in the past is you end up
with a fairly narrow statute

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.340
that is frustrating for
people who are supposed

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:26.690
to be the intended
beneficiary of the statute.

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.570
A better approach, in our mind,

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.900
is if the statutory
mandates an exception

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:36.710
but permits the Copyright Office
to provide more information

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:39.980 position:56%
about the contours of the exemption
at a later date, like so for example

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:44.450
if the statute-- let's
take the issue of that uses

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:45.750
for people who are blind.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:52.890
You know, if it was to address the
obligations in the Marrakesh Treaty

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:56.150
for people with disabilities.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.890
If the mandate was broad but there
was some sort of understanding

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:03.200
that there could be, at some point,

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.040
more contextual information
provided, if necessary,

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:12.870 position:56%
by the Copyright Office down the
road, it might be a better situation

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:15.410
than trying to spell out
every particular issue

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:17.330
that you might want
to do by statute.

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:20.700
Another thing I think
that's important--

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.820
I mean, we think that the idea of
more or less permanent exceptions--

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.310
I think permanent is a funny
word because nothing's really,

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:29.080
even in a statute, permanent.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.760
So, I think what you're
talking about is durable

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.090
and persistent exceptions.

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:39.990 position:56%
And so, I think the Copyright
Office surely should be able to do--

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.310
you know, the three-year
thing I think is a mistake.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:45.090
I think a lot of people have
talked about that in other panels.

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:49.300
One thing-- One of the reasons that
there's a high cost of developing

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.630
and implementing both the
tools to use the exception and,

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:56.850
as important I think, the
standards and the best practices

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:58.730
for implementing exceptions.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:00.770
Now, if you want to have a
conversation, for example,

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:03.950 position:56%
among authorized entities for people
that are blind or you want to talk

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:07.160 position:56%
about archivists or you want to talk
about maybe about auto-mechanics

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.330
or whatever group you want to
have, for them to sort of sort

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:14.560
out the problems of the
different stakeholders

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.720
so that they're not just
looking at their own interests,

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.960 position:56%
but they're looking at the interests
of third parties that are affected

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.200
by the policies that
are implemented.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.150
That can be a pretty
complicated thing.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:25.630
And then you want to, you
know, and then you have

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:27.680
like a small enough number of
people, like the number of people

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.210
in this room, can kind of figure
out what that rule should be.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:33.960
And then, you want to like educate
like thousands of people, you know,

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.990
as to how to sort of
use that standard and so

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:37.620
that they do it in
an appropriate way.

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:41.130
And then, you sort of say, but
this whole exercise is going

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:43.510
to be revisited three
years from now.

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:46.500
I mean, this kind of defeats the
idea that you're really serious

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.570
about doing it in a thoughtful
way, where you have buy-in

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:51.720
and implementation
that's really consistent.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:55.280
So I think that one of the
reasons for the more persistent

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:59.790
and durable exceptions is the fact
that it really is time-consuming

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:03.110
and costly to design
the tools for exceptions

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:05.790 position:56%
and to implement them appropriately.

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:07.510
Thank you.

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:08.810
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:11.650
Mr. Williams, did you have--

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:14.470
&gt;&gt; Matt Williams: Just a quick
point to go back to something

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:18.300
that Troy Dow said on
evidence of harm from any

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.960
of the existing exemptions,
he's absolutely right.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.590
It's almost impossible for us to
collect data to show that someone

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:26.360
who used the exemption ended

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.690
up circulating pirate
copies on the Internet.

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:32.020
On the other hand, in
every cycle I think

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:36.910
since the AV works exemptions have
been in existence, we have pointed

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:40.730
to examples in the
proponent's comments of uses

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:43.310
that we think are likely
to be infringing.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:46.690
They are not uses that my
clients have had any interest

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:48.870
in pursuing litigation over.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:54.690
And calculating the actual harm
involved is quite difficult.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:23:00.140 position:56%
But, I just wanted for the record
to note that we have each cycle come

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.850
across uses that the
proponents have said are examples

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:06.970
of how they're using the exemptions
and our response has been, well,

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.650
some of these are actually
probably unlawful.

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:10.950
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Great.

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:12.250
Thank you.

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:13.620
I want to go back to Ms. Cox,
and then I think we're going

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.320
to move to the next topic.

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:20.130
&gt;&gt; Krista L. Cox: Just because
108 has been such a focus

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:24.470 position:56%
of this discussion so far, you know,
I just want to say that, you know,

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:27.390
there have been some criticisms
that 108 is out of date

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:29.330
and therefore libraries
just look at fair use.

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:32.310
And while it's certainly true
that fair use is critical

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:36.010
to libraries, we do
use 108 every day.

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:38.960
I mean, I talk to-- any librarian
that I talk to, they say,

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.320
of course, 108 is still relevant.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.680
It's still something we use.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.880
Is it, you know, as
good as fair use?

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:49.930
Probably not, because fair use
is adaptable and, you know,

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:53.410
it is flexible enough to
accommodate these new technologies.

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:56.050
But 108 is not an obsolete statute.

00:23:56.050 --> 00:24:01.240
And just with respect to
whether it's hard to get evidence

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:05.150
of downstream uses, while I
acknowledge that, yes, you know,

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:08.180
Mr. Dow and Mr. Williams may be
correct that it can be difficult

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:12.030
to trace back exactly where
an infringing copy came from,

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:15.030
I certainly hope that you're
not suggesting that libraries

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:17.450
and educational institutions
are using this exemption

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:21.170
and passing out infringing copies.

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:23.260
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:26.610
So I think now we're
going to move to talk

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:29.940
about the reverse engineering,
encryption research

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.670
and security testing exemptions.

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:36.350
As you may know, in the
2015 recommendation,

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:40.960
the Office found a
compelling case that 1201(f),

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.910 position:56%
(g) and (h) are inadequate to
accommodate their intended purposes.

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:48.270
So, I just would like to
start with a general question.

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:53.700 position:56%
I'd like to ask your views as to how
these provisions might be amended

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:57.800
to more effectively facilitate
legitimate reverse engineering

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.090
activities and security research.

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:05.060 position:56%
I think this may be particularly
relevant to Mr. Geiger and Mr. Mohr.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:14.610
But others, of course, are
welcome to comment as well.

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:15.910
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: Sure.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:25.120
Thanks. Well, just a couple
of preliminary points.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:31.040
Essentially, from our
perspective, we believe we don't--

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:36.170
I'm not sure we share
the Office's conclusions

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:37.470
on this particular point.

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:43.830
We believe that the current statute
is working, that it can work.

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:47.440
Let me just address
a couple of things.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.840
I mean, one of the things
that I have heard today

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.400
that probably would
cause my members a bit

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:59.600
of heartburn is some suggestion,
maybe implicit, maybe not,

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:07.140
that software is let's say a
second class copyright citizen.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:11.400
And that is something that
we wholeheartedly reject.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.720
And we heard that,
I think, in some--

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:21.160
as if one can separate the
function from expression easily.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:25.710
I really-- I have looked
at a decent number

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:28.820
of cases examining these issues
and that's not an easy line.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:34.630
And it hasn't been an easy line
basically for a long, long time.

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:39.460
And it's true not only with
respect to computer programs,

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:46.140
but it's also true with respect
to cheerleader uniforms and plays

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.980
and all kinds of idea expression.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:51.420
It's the same line that's
expressed in different ways.

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.680
And it's a really fuzzy one.

00:26:55.700 --> 00:27:00.130
With respect to the
exemptions themselves, I mean,

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:04.030
we believe the reverse
engineering exemption is adequate.

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:10.300
With respect to security testing,
our members have relationships

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:14.360
with the security testing industry.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:18.500
If there are areas in which
voluntary agreements may be useful

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:22.920
to kind of allay Section
1201 concerns,

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.240
we're certainly open
to discussing those.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:32.960
But at this time, we don't see
any need to open up the statute.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:36.060
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Can I ask a more
targeted question about 1201(f),

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.390
the reverse engineering statute?

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:42.340
So, in the rulemakings and in
yesterday, we heard a lot about,

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.450
you know, how 1201 was not
intended to prevent, you know,

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:49.360
a lock-in effect for printers or
garage door openers or something.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.860
And when I read 1201(f),
it says you can, you know,

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.780
circumvent for the
purpose of identifying

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:59.100
and analyzing elements necessary
to achieve interoperability.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:03.230
Do you have an opinion on whether
it makes sense to reform 1201(f)

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:04.970
to include, you know,
things necessary

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:06.700
to enable interoperability?

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.150
And I think the Breaking Down
Barriers to Innovation Act,

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:11.360
you know, has some specific
language for that too.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.930
I mean, what are your thoughts on
going beyond I guess identifying

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:20.240
and analyzing into helping
facilitate interoperability?

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:27.130
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: I think there's--

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:31.500
I think that if my
recollection is correct,

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.880
and it very well may not
be, that this particular--

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:39.500
that the standard in 1201(f)
came out of existing case law.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.430
I can't recall which case.

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:44.630
I would have concerns about
the breadth of the concept

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:50.220
of facilitating interoperability
covers I think a wealth of sins.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.290
And many of them would-- could lead

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:57.100
to pretty bad things
for a lot of my members.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:04.840
So, I'm not-- color me skeptical
about that particular proposal.

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:08.050
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Mr. Geiger?

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:09.730
&gt;&gt; Harley Geiger: Thanks.

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:15.200
So unsurprisingly, we disagree that
the statute is currently working

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.810
with regard to security research.

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:19.170
The temporary exemption
is a big deal for us.

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:20.470
It is extremely helpful.

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:23.910
But that aside, in talking
about the permanent exemption,

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:28.780
as it stands right now, 1201does
chill very important security

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:33.070
research, research that will
help prevent harm to individuals

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:35.060
and it will help prevent
breach of sensitive data.

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:37.060
And we gave you an
example in our comments.

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.190
We have a researcher
that is employed

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:41.690
by Rapid7 who is a diabetic.

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:44.610
He wants to research his own
insulin pump, but was prevented

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:46.610
from doing so, prior to
the temporary exemption,

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:49.340
because of 1201 of the DMCA.

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:51.520
In addition, a lot of
independent security researchers,

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.230
folks that are not necessarily
employed by us but that we work

00:29:54.230 --> 00:30:00.200 position:56%
with to help improve our own
security products, they are chilled.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.370
That is, they don't engage in the
research to begin with or many

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:05.060
of them actually receive
cease-and-desist letters

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:06.790
that reference the DMCA.

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:10.470
This is again prior to
the temporary exemption.

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:14.140
So we don't think that it works
and we think that this issue

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:17.160
of security research in software
is becoming a lot more important.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:20.360
As discussed previously, we are
seeing this explosion of software,

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.610
both in the physical
world and virtually.

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:24.060
And there are a lot
more security flaws

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.360
than there are people to fix it.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:29.180
And in many cases,
manufacturers either don't know

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:31.620
about the software
flaws or they turn--

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:33.620
they're willfully ignorant of them.

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:35.990
Part of the problem with
voluntary agreements,

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:38.480
and this goes to the
requirement of authorization

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:42.600
in the permanent exception, is
that it hampers independence.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.380
It means that the manufacturers
themselves get

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:47.350
to control completely how the
security research takes place

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:48.650
and what the publication is like.

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:50.120
And if you're a manufacturer

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:52.130
that doesn't support
independent security research

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:54.800
or if you are a manufacturer
that has something to hide,

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:58.640
as Volkswagen, for example,

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.380
might then that will make the
research a lot less effective

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:02.960
and not as independent.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.980
There are also several
other problems

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.970
with the permanent exception,
one of which is this requirement

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:09.930
that it violate no other law.

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:12.980
The CFAA is very, very broad.

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.280
It's very ambiguous.

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:17.380
It is the subject right now of
some pretty sharp circuit splits.

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:20.780
So you're importing a lot of the
ambiguity from these other laws

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:25.520
into 1201, laws that have
their own chilling problems

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:29.180
and doing it largely for
non-copyright reasons.

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:31.320
There's also a part of the
permanent exemption that says

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.730
that the information derived from
the research cannot be maintained

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:37.000
in such a way that could
facilitate infringement

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.760
or violation of another law.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.510
Well, what happens if
you're a security researcher

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:42.030
and you've contacted
the manufacturer

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:43.710
about a problem in their product?

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.870
They do nothing and the standard
practice is that eventually,

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:49.040
you will make that
disclosure public.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.010
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Well, doesn't the
statute sort of contemplate by that

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:53.040
by saying it's a factor
that should be considered?

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:57.560 position:56%
And maybe in that specific use case,
it would make sense to not stick it

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.590
with the manufacturer,
but to go broader?

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:00.890
&gt;&gt; Harley Geiger: Absolutely.

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:02.430
The fact that it's just
a factor as opposed

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:03.920
to an outright requirement, sure.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:07.600 position:56%
But both factors are cutting against
the security researcher, right?

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.560
One is, you know, if
they've publicly disclosed it

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.520
and then others can use
that for nefarious purposes,

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.930
which is part of the point, right?

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:16.630
Part of the reason why
you publicly disclose is

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:18.850
to encourage a manufacturer
to actually correct their flaw

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:20.670
if they haven't been previously.

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:24.960
And then, the second was
whether the information is solely

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.930
for the purpose of
benefiting the manufacturer,

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:29.550
the owner of the computer system.

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:31.560
And a lot of times, security
researchers are doing this

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:32.920
for the benefit of the public,

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:35.090
not necessarily the owner
of the computer system.

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:37.770
I want to make three
other points really quick

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:39.070
because we've talked about--

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:40.370 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Right, keep it quick

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:41.670
because we'll have
follow-up questions.

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:42.970
&gt;&gt; Harley Geiger: I'll
talk about it quickly.

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:44.270
We talked about this in
previous panels, right?

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:48.910
So this idea of an
embedded software exception

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:52.410 position:56%
or in the temporary exception, we're
talking about consumer devices.

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:54.050
These lines are blurring, right?

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:56.500
And things that are embedded
in software now may not be--

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:59.650
or embedded in devices now may
not be in devices in the future,

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:01.800
consumer devices, likewise.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.900
Security researchers work
on more than just devices.

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:05.200
They work on networks.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.200
They work on completely
virtual software.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.660
Then what counts as a
consumer device is also

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:13.990
in many cases a business device
or is used by infrastructure.

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:16.780
And we want to encourage that
kind of security research.

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:19.090
So, thank you.

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:22.470
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: I'd like
to ask you a follow-up

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:24.620
and then others can
weigh in as well.

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.390
It's sort of a more
general question.

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:31.590
I mean, you mentioned
the multifactor framework

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:35.870
that both 1201(g) and
(j) provide for.

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:39.750
As a general matter, do
you sort of think that type

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:42.510
of framework is helpful,
where there's sort

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:45.940
of a multifactor analysis that
a court can take into account?

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:51.360 position:56%
Or does that in itself provide--
sort of reduce some of the certainty

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:54.910
as to what's permitted and
under what circumstances?

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:56.750
&gt;&gt; Harley Geiger: It
absolutely reduces the certainty.

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:58.810
And in our opinion, we'd prefer

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:02.880
to see a blanket security research
exception for things that are not--

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:08.040
just for the sole purpose of
improving the safety and security

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.340
and correcting software flaws.

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:11.880 position:56%
So, I would kind of cut it off right

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.570
after the definition
of security testing.

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:17.660
So in many cases, we
are seeing agencies move

00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:21.240
to protect the other types
of equities that you see

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:24.660
in the permanent exception,
like privacy, like safety.

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:30.970
The NHTSA, the Transportation
Security Agency as well as the FTC

00:34:30.970 --> 00:34:36.180
and others like they are already
moving to protect against hacking

00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:37.780
that in a way that violate privacy.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.700
We've got laws for that.

00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:44.730 position:56%
So it's unclear to us why 1201 ought
to be the vehicle, so to speak,

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:46.870
to prevent those types
of activities.

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:51.370
I will also say that when it comes
to trafficking, you know, we--

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:53.280
because we are a penetration
testing company,

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.650
we actually do use software.

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:59.210
We even market software that
can be used to circumvent.

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:02.210
And some of that includes
circumventing passwords

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:03.660
or brute forcing encryption.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.920
Companies, this is very valuable
to them because they want

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.130
to know what flaws
they're susceptible to.

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:10.100
And so, we have to
traffic in that software

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:12.390
in order to run our business.

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:13.920
And we work with security
researchers

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.880
that send us updates and exploits.

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.550
They traffic in the
circumvention tools to us

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:20.300
so that we can keep our
products up to date.

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:23.760
So this is an important
component of security research.

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.290
And I will just-- I'm saying
this because I wouldn't want

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:30.050
to see trafficking fall by
the wayside if we're talking

00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:32.680
about reforming the
permanent exemptions.

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:33.980
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:37.190
Mr. Williams?

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:39.360
&gt;&gt; Matt Williams: Thank you.

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:43.460
I'm primarily here to talk about
books and music and movies.

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:46.050
So, some of these issues are

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:49.120
to a certain degree separate
from those interests.

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:55.100
However, I do have some concerns
that if you start taking a lot

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:59.820
of the limitations out of some
of these permanent exceptions,

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:02.130
that there will be
unintended consequences

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:06.420
that will impact the industries
that I'm here representing.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.650
I went through the
statute this morning

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:12.440
and had the pending
legislation and started marking

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.120
through the portions
that would be deleted.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:20.170
And a lot of the safeguards that
Congress decided it made sense

00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:21.950 position:56%
to put in there are being taken out.

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:25.640
And some of that might be for
perfectly legitimate purposes.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.850
I can't speak to that.

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:31.630
But some of it could
cause some harm.

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:36.150
And so, I'm skeptical of whether
it's necessary because usually

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:39.820
when Congress decides to amend
an exception that's already

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:42.430
in the statute, there's
a number of cases

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:44.160
that have come through the courts.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:48.010
They've either come out the wrong
way or there's a lot of indecision

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:49.500
between them when you compare them.

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.990
And I don't think that's
been the case here.

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:53.890
There's been a lot of
debate in the rulemaking

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:57.250
about what the existing exemptions
would allow or not allow.

00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:00.890
But I haven't seen much in the
way of litigation to point to.

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:04.890
So, I think to take it to
Congress without those types

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:10.300
of badly decided cases, it
might be a bit of a stretch.

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:13.030
I mean, I can think back
to when the last sentence

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:17.410
of Section 107 was added
and I think that was 1992.

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:21.650
There was five, six, seven I
think unpublished works cases

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:25.270
that took place before the Congress
decided we should add this sentence

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:28.240
that just basically says if
it's an unpublished work,

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:29.850
it might still be a fair use.

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:31.640
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Well, can I
ask you a follow-up question?

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.800
Because I, you know,
I take your point

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.050
about treading lightly
on statutory reform.

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:38.130
But we do have this
rulemaking process

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:39.980
where if the permanent
exemption isn't working,

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:41.660 position:56%
perhaps you're not seeing litigation

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:44.020
but you are seeing petitions
before the Copyright Office.

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:46.570
And the security testing
might be such an example

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:49.400
where they said the requirement
that there's authorization

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.330
from the owner is not
working for us.

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:53.430
Could you grant us a
different exemption?

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:54.730
I think in prior rulemakings,

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:57.950
we saw that more specific
for certain devices.

00:37:57.950 --> 00:38:02.590 position:56%
But there's sort of a repeat echo of
security research being something,

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:05.690
you know, if properly defined,
that might be permissible

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:07.010
through the exemption process.

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:11.450
I mean, would you oppose maybe not
crossing out all of the statute,

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:13.270
but for example, that specific--

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:15.610
you know, could you speak to
specific reform proposals,

00:38:15.610 --> 00:38:21.010
the requirement of
authorization being one of them?

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:23.840
&gt;&gt; Matt Williams: I guess I
would say again that I think

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:28.690
that the easier and preferable
route to addressing those issues

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:30.880
that have already been
raised in the rulemaking is

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:35.290
to do the streamlined renewal
process as opposed to taking this

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:39.170
to Congress and asking them
to rewrite the statute.

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:43.140 position:56%
One, because I am worried that there
will be unintended consequences,

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:47.870
but two, because I also think it's
such a difficult task to draft it

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:51.670
in such a way that no one who's
writing a law review article is

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:54.430
going to be able to come
up with a hypothetical case

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:56.250
that would come out the wrong way.

00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:58.160
And then, people are
going to have to come back

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.770
and present issues
to you guys anyway.

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:06.480
So, I'm not so sure that trying

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:11.120
to rewrite it will actually fix the
problem of people needing to bring

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:14.900
to your attention issues
that are of concern to them.

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:18.790
I'm not ready to go through
line by line on the things

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:23.700
that have been proposed to be
taken out and give you a position

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:26.080
for my clients on each one of them.

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.520
But the things that concerned
me were the completely striking

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.300
out the factors to be considered.

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:34.170
As you said, they're just
factors to be considered.

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:39.380
Violations of other laws in
the context of these things

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.780
that also I think is
something that would have

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:44.090
to be thought about very carefully.

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:45.700
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:47.000
Mr.--

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.300
&gt;&gt; Matt Williams: I'm sorry.

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:49.680
I had one last thing that I
originally intended to say.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.980
I apologize.

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:52.280
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Sure.

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:53.580 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Matt Williams: One thing I would
just ask you to do, if you do decide

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:57.010
to make recommendations in this
area, is if you'd go back to,

00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:02.800 position:56%
I think, 2010 and earlier rulemaking
decisions, there were issues

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:07.490
that came up about whether or not
you're entitled to access a movie

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:11.050
or another expressive work on
every different type of device

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:13.080 position:56%
that you might want to access it on.

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:16.830
And the Office consistently
concluded that that's not the case,

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:18.760
that you don't have that right.

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:22.220
And I would just ask that if
you make changes in this area,

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:25.160
you take a look at those prior
decisions and just make sure

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:28.620
that you don't overrule
them essentially

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:31.940
without intending to do so.

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:33.240
Thanks.

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.540
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Mr. Love?

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:45.270
&gt;&gt; James Love: When a-- There's
this automatic protection

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:49.520
that is associated with technical
protection measures right now

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:58.690
and we would prefer a system
where you'd apply, pay a small fee

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:03.000
and register the fact that you
have a technical protection measure

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.130
that you believe is entitled

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:07.410
or should be entitled
to legal protection.

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:10.120
And then, in the application
for doing so,

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:18.780
that you would describe how you
would address legitimate use

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:24.640
of users under exceptions, issues
of interoperability, perhaps issues

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.480
of sunsets on the protections
such as depositing unlock keys

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.380
for the Copyright Office.

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:31.790
And that you would
have terms of service

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:36.000
for the technical protection
measure which describes the impact

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.110 position:56%
of the technical protections on what
you believe the user rights to be,

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:45.090
something along that lines
where you begin to sort

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:50.580
of treat the legal protections of
TPMs as a privilege, not a right.

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:54.720 position:56%
And that you associate the privilege
with obligations on the person

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:57.260
who wants the state to
enforce the right for them,

00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:00.240
recognizing that there
are these competing areas.

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:07.790
I think that that would-- Some of
the problems you have right now

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:13.520
of people are looking for permanent
exceptions and things like that.

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:19.160
I mean, sometimes it's because
the practices in the TPM, I think,

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.860
are so inconsistent
with public policy.

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:30.350
And it's just the-- it's
obvious that, you know,

00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:32.940
you want to have some
carve-outs, some sort of it.

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:35.250
But people always raise
these issues like, well,

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:37.980
do you anticipate all the
problems and things like that.

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.670
I think just starting with the
idea that everything is protected

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:43.580
and you have to kind of
claw back the exceptions,

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:45.050
I think that creates
a lot of the problems.

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:47.860
If you sort of create the
environment where you have to sort

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:51.510 position:56%
of make a case for the exceptions or
at least describe what you believe

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:53.940
that you've made the
case at a very minimum.

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:56.980
I think it begins to make the
whole process more manageable.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:59.860
Also, I'm a little concerned
about the relationship

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:02.890
between trade agreements and what
you're doing in this proceeding

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:06.170
because you're-- the government is
involved in these trade agreements

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:10.000
where you're creating exceptions
about what we have to do

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.980
within the context of
the trade agreements.

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:14.400
And then they're creating
these investor state agreements

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:17.300
where people can bring
lawsuits against the--

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:21.270
or bring arbitrations against the
United States around those things

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:23.650
if their expectations aren't
met and things like that.

00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:26.070
And I think that it would be
important for the Copyright Office,

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:29.030 position:56%
to the extent that they're modifying
the rules or changing the rules

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:32.300
in this thing to also talk to the
United States Trade Representative

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:35.650
to make sure that they're
ensuring there's enough flexibility

00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:36.950
in our agreements.

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:39.270 position:56%
So if we change our philosophy about
how to do these technical locks

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:41.880
on things across a wide
range of industries,

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:45.710
not just the motion picture
industry or the book industry,

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:47.880
but in these areas that
involve automobiles

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:51.520
and consumer electronic devices
and all the other things affected

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:55.090
by the trade agreements,
that we're not in a situation

00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:57.230
where you're trying to do one thing

00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:59.080
where the United States
Trade Office--

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:03.010
Trade Representative is
making that difficult.

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:04.310
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:09.030
And that actually sort of
anticipated a quick question.

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:13.590
So, are there any other examples
around the world of that sort

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:18.470 position:56%
of system where, you know,
providing for a registration of TPMs

00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:21.850
that you're aware of, and might

00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:28.730
that implicate international
obligations of the US?

00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:31.150
&gt;&gt; James Love: I think
right now, the closest model

00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:34.270
for that would be the obligation
in the European Directive

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:37.730
that you have responded--
that you have obligations

00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:43.480
to provide user rights in areas
that are part of the Directive.

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:46.210
Although I don't think it's
really spelled out very clearly.

00:44:46.210 --> 00:44:48.800
And it's not the same as
sort of registering works.

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:52.840
I think though that the movement
against registration and copyright

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:57.060
across the board for
everything has been a mistake.

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:59.930
And I think the idea--
You could make an analogy

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:03.750
between the collateral damage
and harm that's been done

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:08.420
by having copyright
always-- I mean, everything--

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:09.720
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: I think we do--

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.940
&gt;&gt; James Love: -- on TPMs, this
is exactly the same problem.

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:14.270
It's just too sweeping.

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:18.690 position:56%
And the combination of no obligation
on the person that's protected

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:20.860
and the fact that everything
is automatically protected,

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:23.390
those things collectively
create a lot of problems.

00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:24.690
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: OK.

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:25.990
Thank you.

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:27.290
Mr. Geiger?

00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:28.830
&gt;&gt; Harley Geiger: If I can
respond to a couple of things

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:32.890
that Mr. Williams said, part of
the reason that we don't see a ton

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:35.990
of litigation on 1201 in
security research is because,

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:37.290
for two reasons.

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:39.650
One, a lot of security
research is chilled and by 1201

00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:42.500
so it actually doesn't get
to the litigation stage.

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:45.350
You know, so we'll see researchers
get cease-and-desist letters

00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:46.810
and many times they
are not able to--

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:49.300
just don't have the expertise
to evaluate the legal claim.

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:51.180
And it just doesn't
go to litigation.

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.480
And then, second--

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.780
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Can I interrupt?

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:55.540
Is that-- Are you speaking
academically

00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:57.320
or commercially or both?

00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:59.930
Because I know in the rulemaking,
there seems to be sort of a divide

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:02.820
between the researchers for
research's sake and those

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:05.600
who are perhaps like
unaffiliated with an organization

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.580
and entities such as Rapid7.

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:10.050
&gt;&gt; Harley Geiger: So, for
folks that are unaffiliated

00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:11.500
with an organization, they--

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:13.770
that's typically where the
cease-and-desist letters tend

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:15.070
to have the most impact.

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:16.430
If you're affiliated
with an organization,

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:20.440 position:56%
then you have more resources to draw
on to evaluate your legal claims.

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:22.540
We play in both worlds.

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:25.290
We work a lot with independent
security researchers and try

00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:27.200
to help be a steward
to that community.

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:30.380
But we also have our
own researchers.

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:34.280
And in cases where you have
an institutional affiliation,

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:36.310
a lot of times you just
see it ignored, right?

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:38.340
You just see-- you see the
cease-and-desist letter just kind

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:40.670 position:56%
of ignored and sort of, well, if you
want to go to litigation over this

00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:42.210
for real, then we'll do that.

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:44.350
And often, it doesn't
get to that stage.

00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:46.910
Either way, the system is broken.

00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:49.090
It may have made more
sense when it was enacted,

00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:50.640
but as it is now, it's not working.

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:53.600
And we have-- I mean, cybersecurity
is a national priority.

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:54.900
Everybody recognizes that.

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:58.680
So why in the world would we wait
for bad cases to be litigated?

00:46:58.680 --> 00:46:59.980
Two other points.

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:04.520
One is when it comes to not
violating any other law,

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:06.670
most of these other
laws, including the CFAA,

00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:09.130
provide a private right of action.

00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:11.850
It would seem odd to us to--

00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:14.920
If the security research
is violating the CFAA,

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:19.550 position:56%
why suddenly the permanent exception
protection should also fall away?

00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:20.900
I mean, the punishments under CFAA

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:23.770
and other laws are
already relatively harsh.

00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:25.840 position:56%
So why add onto that with copyright?

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.770
I don't understand why
that would play into it?

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:30.860
And in addition, if it's a matter
of violating a licensing agreement,

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:35.140
then you do have recourse
through breach of contract to go

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:36.440
after the researcher there.

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:37.950
So, there are other
avenues that don't need

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:41.180 position:56%
to necessarily rope in Section 1201.

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:43.000
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Can I ask
you a more targeted question?

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.600
Because I am hoping that these
roundtables sort of focuses

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:49.590
on potential areas of reform or
why they may not be advisable.

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:53.180
But, if you can trust
the encryption exemption

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:55.360
with a security testing exemption,

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:57.210
security testing exemption
I think needs to be

00:47:57.210 --> 00:47:59.970
with the authorization
whereas with encryption,

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:01.350
you just need to make
a good faith effort.

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:02.780
And I know in the rulemaking,
we heard a lot

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:06.610
about the bug bounty programs or
front door policy or, you know,

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:11.230
ways in which there is sort of
an understood protocol or norms

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:14.590
or ethics that one might go
about in getting authorization.

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:18.590
If we made some revision to
call it a good faith effort

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:19.990
to get authorization as opposed

00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:22.370
to a requirement, would
that help you out?

00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:25.220
Would that be-- Do others
see problems with that?

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:29.030 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Harley Geiger: So, unfortunately,
no, and for a couple of reasons.

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:31.190
It's definitely better
than a requirement.

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:34.650 position:56%
And our standard practice is that we
do make a good faith effort to try

00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:38.380
to contact the vendor,
whoever has the flaw.

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:43.330
And however, that is not--
not every manufacturer,

00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:48.980
not every vendor actually has a
means of being able-- of contact.

00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:52.240
And it is a policy that
in fact, the Department

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:57.000
of Commerce is working now
to try to get more adopted

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.730
through its multi-stakeholder
process.

00:48:58.730 --> 00:49:01.900
But it is not really the norm
among industries right now.

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:05.070
And especially with the internet
of things, where we're seeing a lot

00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:09.540
of companies that are
entering this computer space

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:13.770
and that maybe have not had a
lot of experience in it before,

00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:17.170 position:56%
they don't necessarily think to have
a vulnerability disclosure process.

00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:19.690 position:56%
And sometimes, it is very
difficult to get in touch with them.

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:20.990
The other problem with it--

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:22.290
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Well, in that case,

00:49:22.290 --> 00:49:24.360
wouldn't you have made
your good faith effort or--

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:25.660
&gt;&gt; Harley Geiger: The
other problem is

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:27.850
that you don't always know
how to contact a vendor.

00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:31.160
And some of the research that
we do is entirely online.

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.460
Some of it is automated.

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:35.650
We have a Project Sonar that
scans the entire Internet

00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:37.360
in fact, does it every week.

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:41.750
And it is not always
feasible to contact the owner.

00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:44.700
And it's often not
feasible to contact--

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:48.310
in the case of Project Sonar, where
we're scanning billions of devices,

00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:49.610
there are millions of owners.

00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:51.560
How do you contact all of them?

00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:54.460
So, it's a best a practice
but it is not one

00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:59.070 position:56%
that I think the protection ought to
hinge on because it doesn't scale.

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:01.250
You know, you don't
always know the owner.

00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:04.200
And even if you do know all
the owners, it doesn't scale

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:06.480
and it's not always the practice

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:08.550
of every manufacturer
to have an avenue.

00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:11.620
And so, there is-- we've
experienced it, sometimes dispute

00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:15.230
over whether the effort
was good enough.

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:17.780
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: I think
we'd like to go to Mr. Mohr

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:20.680
and then turn to the next topic.

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:26.260
[ Inaudible Discussion ]

00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:31.420
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: Just a couple
of pretty quick points.

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:35.460
It's difficult for me to figure

00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:41.100
out exactly what Mr.
Geiger's company does.

00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:44.930
I don't know precisely what
they do and how they do it.

00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:47.120
I would actually like to discuss

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:50.010
that with him afterwards,
in a nice way.

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:51.310
[ Laughter ]

00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:52.610
&gt;&gt; Harley Geiger: Anytime, anytime.

00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:54.720 position:56%
I didn't want to take up time in the
panel, but I'd be happy to do that.

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.390 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: That would be useful.

00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:57.690
I mean, just a couple of things.

00:50:57.690 --> 00:51:00.760
Look, I mean, computer
networks existed

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:04.770
at the time this statute
was enacted.

00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:07.390
Things are different now.

00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:12.860
Certainly, the connectivity of
ordinary devices is expanding.

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:21.140
But our members certainly have--
are quite fond of the CFAA,

00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:25.250
for example, in its current form.

00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:31.200
And they are also quite fond of
the DMCA in its current form.

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:37.100
We-- Again, I mean, a lot of our--
I mean, a lot of our concerns are--

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:45.170
they may not be as much with
the legitimate activities

00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:47.590
that Mr. Geiger's company does.

00:51:47.590 --> 00:51:50.510
I mean, Sonar to me does
not sound like cracking.

00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:52.390
It sounds like looking.

00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:57.960
That's not something that
would necessarily implicate the

00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:02.030
circumvention of a
technological protection measure.

00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:05.340
And that's why-- I heard that
and that's why it struck me.

00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:12.310
I was puzzled as to how the
DMCA would be implicated

00:52:12.310 --> 00:52:15.850
in a situation like that.

00:52:15.850 --> 00:52:18.670
&gt;&gt; Harley Geiger: So, I just
used Sonar as an example

00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:21.620
of a large-scale security
research program.

00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:25.390
And for the most part,
Sonar is just looking.

00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:30.880
And we're looking at
ports and website--

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:34.050
or web router and website
connections that are not encrypted

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:40.040
or that have-- appear to have no
password protection and so forth.

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:44.350
And CFAA actually stops us from
going further in many cases.

00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:48.690
But I'm mostly using that as
just an example for the problem

00:52:48.690 --> 00:52:51.950
that you would have with scaling
for a large-scale research project

00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:59.220
and something that you are able to
provide notice to individuals for.

00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:03.080
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: And my concern
would be with a large-scale--

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:10.800
something dubbed a large-scale
research project that did much more

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:13.650
than let's say walk
around a neighborhood

00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:15.080
and see whose blinds were down.

00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:19.380
I mean, at that point,
we would have concerns.

00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:22.000
We would have obviously
security concerns

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:27.170
and we would have potentially
infringement concerns as well.

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:28.470
&gt;&gt; Harley Geiger: Well,
I understand that.

00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:30.870
I'm not really sure where the
copyright infringement concern is

00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:32.260
there on your end.

00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:37.500
But let's say that it is a
project like Sonar that is scanning

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:40.450
for routers that are
sending unencrypted traffic

00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:44.800
or that there is a flaw in the
implementation of the encryption.

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:48.760 position:56%
And so, you'd want to check to see
whether or not that flaw was present

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:51.410
in these routers all
around the world.

00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:54.730
And I would guess that you could
probably find thousands of routers

00:53:54.730 --> 00:53:57.810
at least that meet this flaw.

00:53:57.810 --> 00:54:00.900
In order to find out that
they are in fact flawed,

00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:03.190
then you may have to test it.

00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:05.480 position:56%
And I don't see where the problem is

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:07.390
for the availability of
the copyrighted work.

00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:09.410
I don't see where the
copyright infringement is.

00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:12.030
It'd be difficult to get
authorization in order to do

00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:17.500
that beforehand or to inform
the router owners directly

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:18.870
after the fact.

00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:22.120
And it would not be
covered currently by any

00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:23.740
of the permanent exceptions.

00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:25.040
And--

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:26.340
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Yeah--

00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:27.640
&gt;&gt; Harley Geiger: Sorry.

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:28.940
Go ahead.

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:30.240
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Sorry.

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:31.540
You all are certainly welcome to
continue this after the roundtable.

00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:33.360
I think we-- I think, did you
have one more question on--

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:35.170
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Yeah,
before we moved off that,

00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:38.600
I just wanted to open it up to
anyone else who wanted to comment

00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:43.650
about these three permanent
exemptions and specifically the one

00:54:43.650 --> 00:54:48.600
for interoperability, 1201, if
anyone had thoughts on that.

00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.380
So Mr. Dow?

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:52.190
&gt;&gt; Troy Dow: Just two
thoughts very quickly.

00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:56.230
One is-- I think this goes to Mr.
Williams' point that this notion

00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:59.210
of interoperability-- I don't
know what Mr. Geiger's company

00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:00.510
does either.

00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:02.270
But just listening to
him, I have every belief

00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:03.710
that what he does is in good faith.

00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:07.110
But what we've seen even in
some of the CSS litigation is

00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:09.870
that we've had people who've tried
to take advantage of the exceptions

00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:12.390
for things like security
testing and interoperability,

00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:16.790
but things that really were just
about removing content protection

00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:20.050 position:56%
from movies and other entertainment.

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:21.580
And so, unfortunately--

00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:23.300
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: And so, in those
instances, they're doing it

00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:26.220
in the name of research or how
do they link that together?

00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:28.530
&gt;&gt; Troy Dow: Well, so for
example, in the Corley case,

00:55:28.530 --> 00:55:30.680
you had a defense that
was put forward that said

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:33.130
that what was going on there was
really just a matter of trying

00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:36.880
to make DVDs interoperable
with Linux computer systems

00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:39.040
because they said there
wasn't a Linux player

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:40.340
that could play those DVDs.

00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:42.420
In fact, there were licensed
Linux players at the time.

00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:44.760
But the problem was that
the way they preferred

00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:47.040
to make those movies
viewable on a Linux player was

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.340
to remove the copy protection.

00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:50.360
Remove the encryption so they
would play on any player, right?

00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:52.690
That makes the movie
interoperable by making sure

00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:54.730
that there are no protections,
right?

00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:58.750
Now, the court saw through that and
didn't see the permanent exemption

00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:00.260
as applicable in that circumstance.

00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:03.410
But it was an example of
somebody who was not a good actor

00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:05.990
who was trying to leverage some of
these exemptions for purposes other

00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:07.290
than the ones that were intended.

00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:10.270
And we need to be mindful of
the ability of people to do

00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:11.570
that in the way they're crafted.

00:56:11.570 --> 00:56:14.680
The second point I was going
to make, and this is sort

00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:17.080
of probably taking my Disney
hat off and putting back

00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:20.550
on my former Judiciary Committee
counsel hat, that this interaction

00:56:20.550 --> 00:56:24.540
between Mr. Geiger and Mr. Mohr
I think just highlights the fact

00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:27.380
that these exceptions in
the statute were very,

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:30.160
very carefully negotiated,
down to every word

00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:32.970
between the relevant
impacted parties.

00:56:32.970 --> 00:56:35.970
If we just start going through
and crossing out words, we start--

00:56:35.970 --> 00:56:37.800
we start upending a
balance that was struck.

00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:39.300
Now, whether or not
this balance continues

00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:41.380
to work today is a
totally separate question.

00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:45.110
But the notion that somehow we
could just start rejiggering things

00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:47.100
and that we would maintain
the type of balance

00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:49.390
that was maintained
I think is a concern.

00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:52.240
If Mr. Mohr and Mr.
Geiger go off and figure

00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:54.500
out what the right
modifications are to it

00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:57.510
and it doesn't implicate the types
of concerns I was referring to,

00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:58.810
that may be another thing.

00:56:58.810 --> 00:57:02.020
But I think this sort of counsels
towards a consensus-based approach

00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:04.800
to these things.

00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:07.120
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Ms. Koberidze?

00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:11.730
&gt;&gt; Maryna Koberidze: I wanted
to pick up on something

00:57:11.730 --> 00:57:17.500
that Mr. Love mentioned
regarding European Directive.

00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:20.760
Europe went with another
approach than the US.

00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:22.810
The US decided to give
fewer exemptions

00:57:22.810 --> 00:57:26.110
and to go with rulemaking process.

00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:31.850
European Union went with
giving an originally long list

00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:33.160
with exemptions.

00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:38.130
But some of the countries decided
to provide a mediation process.

00:57:38.130 --> 00:57:44.720
And maybe with permanent exemptions
under 1201, that could be an option

00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:49.280
for the parties to get into that
mediation process, like we just saw

00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:50.660
with Mr. Geiger and Mr. Mohr.

00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:53.600
They are open to discussion.

00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:54.900
And that would be helpful.

00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:59.180
So for example, it could be
like the first step would be

00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:02.780
for the interested beneficiary
of the exemption to come forward

00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:05.590
and contact the copyright
holder and say,

00:58:05.590 --> 00:58:11.300
we would like to make certain uses
under the permanent exemption.

00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:14.200
Do you agree or not?

00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:18.140
If they do not, then the
intended beneficiaries could go

00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:21.510
and request certain agency.

00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:26.140
In this case, it would be
Copyright Office to help

00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:31.120
to accommodate the access
or third party assistance,

00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:33.690
whatever is applicable
in the specific--

00:58:33.690 --> 00:58:36.770
under a specific permanent
exemption.

00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:38.250
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:40.620
I do think we need to move on.

00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:45.300
I want to turn to talking
about proposals

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:47.440
for new permanent exemptions.

00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:51.190
And I wanted to start
with a proposal

00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:55.030
that we saw pretty
substantial agreement

00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:56.460
on in the written comments.

00:58:56.460 --> 00:58:58.500
And that would be an exemption

00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:01.090
for the print-disabled
and visually impaired.

00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:07.670
As you know, the current exemption
applies to literary works protected

00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:12.930
by TPMs that prevent read-aloud
functionality or screen readers

00:59:12.930 --> 00:59:15.340
or other assistive technologies.

00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:18.440
I would be interested
in your thoughts

00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:22.030
about whether Congress
might consider making

00:59:22.030 --> 00:59:24.030
that specific exemption permanent.

00:59:24.030 --> 00:59:28.260
If so, whether the current
language is sufficient

00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:31.360
or whether it should
be altered in some way.

00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:35.240
And I'd like to start
with Mr. Cazares.

00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:41.290
&gt;&gt; Gabe Cazares: I think that I
first and foremost would be remiss

00:59:41.290 --> 00:59:45.810
if I didn't recognize the effort
that both the publishing industry

00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:51.770
and the libraries have done in the
last few years to try and ensure

00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:55.390
that accessibility is
something that's incorporated

00:59:55.390 --> 00:59:56.690
from the beginning.

00:59:56.690 --> 01:00:01.900
I think Ms. Cox brought up a
good point on the exemptions

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:06.740 position:56%
that the libraries really do rely on
to ensure that assistive technology

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:10.300
and other technologies
used by the blind

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:13.080 position:56%
and visually impaired are available.

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:17.540
And likewise the publishers have
done great work with their members

01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:20.440
to ensure that products are
being produced accessibly.

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:26.210
Having said that, I think that
it's safe to say that for people

01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:28.620 position:56%
who are blind and visually impaired,

01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:31.760
that circumstance certainly
isn't going to change.

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:34.890
I expect to be blind
three years from now.

01:00:34.890 --> 01:00:40.490
So I think that the discussion
is worth having on setting

01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:42.440
up a permanent exemption.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:48.630
I think that the language that
we have now is worth revisiting,

01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:51.480
with all of the interested
stakeholders.

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:53.060
Accessibility has been something

01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:57.390
that has quite literally
taken a village to try

01:00:57.390 --> 01:00:58.870
and bring to the mainstream.

01:00:58.870 --> 01:01:02.210
So I think that the discussions
that we've spearheaded,

01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:05.850
both with the libraries and the
publishers and the discussion

01:01:05.850 --> 01:01:08.050
that we're having now
is a good start.

01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:11.060
But I definitely know that
the National Federation

01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:14.820
of the Blind is supportive
of such permanent exemption.

01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:16.120
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:17.420
May I ask a follow-up?

01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:23.320 position:56%
I just would be curious to know your
views on sort of how the market--

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:28.070 position:56%
and you mentioned this at the outset
of your statement-- is responding.

01:01:28.070 --> 01:01:32.360 position:56%
Have you noticed a change over time,

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:39.780
an increase in accessible
format copies becoming available

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:45.740
in the marketplace, such
that, you know, maybe the need

01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.940
to circumvent may be diminished?

01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:53.210
&gt;&gt; Gabe Cazares: So I certainly
don't think that we're at a point

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:55.350
where the need to circumvent
needs to be diminished,

01:01:55.350 --> 01:01:59.320
particularly in the
realm of education.

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:03.060
There's still a lot of work
that needs to be done to ensure

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:08.140
that eBooks and digital books that
are produced particularly with,

01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:11.510
you know, the DRM, are accessible.

01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:15.550 position:56%
What we're finding now is that a
lot of time authorized entities have

01:02:15.550 --> 01:02:19.580
to then take such materials and
ensure that they're accessible.

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:23.520
I think that we're doing-- we're
making significant progress.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.520
But I don't think we're
at the happy-go-lucky day

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.980
where I can safely
say that everything

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:32.580
that is produced digitally,
particularly in the literary realm,

01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:35.550
is accessible from the beginning.

01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:36.850
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Great.

01:02:36.850 --> 01:02:38.150
Thank you.

01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:40.920
Ms. Cox?

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:44.020
&gt;&gt; Krista L. Cox: So, you've heard
me say earlier, but, of course,

01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:47.290
we agree with the position of the
National Federation of the Blind

01:02:47.290 --> 01:02:50.520
that these permanent
exemptions are necessary.

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:51.970
And I would just add a few points,

01:02:51.970 --> 01:02:56.470
that as the Obama administration
earlier this year submitted the

01:02:56.470 --> 01:03:01.070
Marrakesh Treaty for
ratification by the Senate,

01:03:01.070 --> 01:03:04.520
also submitted implementing
legislation, it's really important

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:07.680
to note that if the Marrakesh
Treaty comes into force,

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:13.130
that in order to comply with the
treaty and really make it useful,

01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:16.270
it would be good to have
that permanent exemption

01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:18.900
to ensure compliance
with the treaty.

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:24.690
Additionally, as Mr. Cazares
pointed out, that even though, yes,

01:03:24.690 --> 01:03:28.720
there are more works being
produced digitally, it doesn't mean

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:32.150
that those works are
necessarily accessible,

01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:34.260 position:56%
especially in the educational realm.

01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:37.860
Our libraries work very often with
the disability services offices

01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:41.590
to ensure that we are able
to provide accessible formats

01:03:41.590 --> 01:03:45.450
of various textbooks,
which are often not created

01:03:45.450 --> 01:03:48.240
in an accessible format
from the start.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.730
You know, we would
love for everything

01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:55.440
to be immediately accessible for
our users that are print-disabled.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.770
But that's simply not
the case today.

01:03:58.770 --> 01:04:02.310
And just, you know,
I think the example

01:04:02.310 --> 01:04:07.110 position:56%
of the print-disabled also ties into
this question of interoperability

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:10.160
because oftentimes individuals

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:13.510
with print disabilities have a
specific device that they use.

01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:19.650
And while it might be accessible on
one format on, you know, an iPad,

01:04:19.650 --> 01:04:22.250
it might not be accessible
on a Kindle.

01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:26.300
And it's really unfair to ask
someone who is print-disabled

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:30.260
to buy five different devices to
find the one that works for them.

01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:34.420
And this actually came up, I
believe, in the rulemaking process

01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:38.030
where the joint reply comments from
rights holders groups like the AAP,

01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:43.290
MPAA, RIAA criticized
the American Federation

01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:47.770
for the Blind's evidence showing
that four of the five works

01:04:47.770 --> 01:04:51.300
that they looked at were
not accessible to them.

01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:53.520
They actually found that three
of those four were accessible.

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.750
They just weren't accessible
on the format that--

01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:59.270
and the platform that was being
used to test this in the evidence.

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:02.550
So I think it's really
important to ensure that,

01:05:02.550 --> 01:05:04.480
especially for the print-disabled,

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:12.370
that you're not restricting
that exemption.

01:05:12.370 --> 01:05:14.640
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:17.540
Ms. Besek?

01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:19.340
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Microphone.

01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:23.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; June M. Besek: This is an
appropriate area for Congress to act

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:28.020
because I think the history
of the rulemaking indicates

01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:31.560
that this is an exemption that's
regularly been sought and granted

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:32.860
without a lot of opposition.

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:36.830
And I think there's strong public
policy reasons for raising it

01:05:36.830 --> 01:05:38.340
to the level of a permanent
exemption.

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:40.260
So, I would favor it in general.

01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:43.430
Although, you know, I
can't say sitting here

01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:45.810
that the exact formulation,
you know,

01:05:45.810 --> 01:05:48.370
of a past rulemaking
is the correct one.

01:05:48.370 --> 01:05:49.930
And that's something that
we would have to look at.

01:05:49.930 --> 01:05:52.700
I do have some concerns
about the, you know,

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:56.820
accessibility discussion
that we just had.

01:05:56.820 --> 01:06:01.240
And, you know, because there's
also the other side of the coin.

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.370
You don't want to discourage
the market

01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:06.950
for creating accessible versions
for other types of devices as well.

01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:09.600
So, there are both sides
of that to consider.

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:11.980
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Do you have a
view as to whether a discussion

01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:14.610
about implementing a permanent
exemption along this line should be

01:06:14.610 --> 01:06:18.720
limited towards sort of
the general subject matter

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:21.010
of the prior exemptions for
the print-disabled as opposed

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:24.010
to accessibility or assistive
technology more broadly?

01:06:24.010 --> 01:06:25.400
I mean, we've received
written comments

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:28.380
of an organization
representing individuals

01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:31.580
with degenerative diseases,
not necessarily related--

01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:34.360
so, not necessarily related
to eBooks or, you know,

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.710
accessing books, but
maybe, you know,

01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:39.530
playing a videogame, for example.

01:06:39.530 --> 01:06:42.030
&gt;&gt; June M. Besek: At this
point, I think because part

01:06:42.030 --> 01:06:44.820
of my rationale is
that there has been--

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:47.830
there have been a series of
exemptions already granted,

01:06:47.830 --> 01:06:50.190
I would mean the print-disabled.

01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:55.270
That doesn't mean that other
groups couldn't seek in the future,

01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:57.530
you know, an exemption
under the rulemaking.

01:06:57.530 --> 01:07:01.560 position:56%
And perhaps at some point, you know,
that that would be deemed worthy

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.760
of a permanent exemption.

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:10.870
But I think it would be
premature to do that right now.

01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:12.170
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Mr. Williams?

01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:13.470
&gt;&gt; Matt Williams: Thank you.

01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:18.050
I think we would agree that this is
an important exemption that's been

01:07:18.050 --> 01:07:21.490
in existence now for some time.

01:07:21.490 --> 01:07:24.220
I think you're also right to say
that there's generally consensus

01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:27.560
that it should continue
to exist and be renewed.

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:28.860
And at this point in time,

01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:33.030
the market isn't adequately
addressing the problem

01:07:33.030 --> 01:07:37.510
and that's why we don't oppose
the existence of the exemption.

01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:40.340
I think the streamlined
renewal process, again,

01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:44.490
is something that would be more
effective at addressing this

01:07:44.490 --> 01:07:48.890
than trying to make the exemption
permanent for a couple of reasons.

01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:53.130
The first is my understanding
is that there are formats

01:07:53.130 --> 01:07:55.430
in development that
are going to roll

01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:59.070
out that will make this
problem much less significant

01:07:59.070 --> 01:08:01.740
if it doesn't go away.

01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:05.300
There's EPUB-3 and HTML-5 which
I understand are both going

01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:08.210
to help address these issues.

01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:10.910
And so, if that were the case

01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:14.920 position:56%
and circumvention became unnecessary
then there wouldn't be a need

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:20.830
to have an exemption sitting in the
statute when we could just renew it

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:22.840
through the rulemaking process.

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:26.940
The other issue is that if the
language does need to be revisited,

01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:30.400
I think that's something
that we would be open to.

01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:33.680
But I don't think I've
seen any specific proposals

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:35.460
about how that needs to be done.

01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:37.340
So that's something
that could be worked

01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:40.300
out before the next rulemaking
or during the next rulemaking.

01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:42.090
If we could come to consensus,

01:08:42.090 --> 01:08:45.110
we could address what the
changes are that need to be made.

01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:49.640
And again, if you put it in the
statute as it currently is drafted

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:54.910
or in some new slightly revised
form, then that's how it will be.

01:08:54.910 --> 01:08:58.360
And the rulemaking, the benefit of
it is it's more flexible than that.

01:08:58.360 --> 01:08:59.710
You can revisit it.

01:08:59.710 --> 01:09:02.800
You can figure out, well, if
it's not fixing the problem,

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:05.110
let's get together
and fix the problem.

01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:07.520
So that's I think the
better way to address it.

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:08.820
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Although, I mean,

01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:13.600
a permanent exemption
wouldn't preclude, you know,

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:16.480
future requests administratively.

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:18.030
&gt;&gt; Matt Williams: No,
I agree with that.

01:09:18.030 --> 01:09:21.620
But I also question
whether it makes sense to go

01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:23.570
through the whole legislative
process

01:09:23.570 --> 01:09:27.970
of putting new permanent
exemptions into the statute

01:09:27.970 --> 01:09:33.640
when it's unlikely they're going to
end up being the ultimate solution.

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:37.580
And I think that's why Congress
created this rulemaking is

01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:40.570
that it knew there's going to
be a lot of things that come

01:09:40.570 --> 01:09:42.610
up that we can't address
in the statute.

01:09:42.610 --> 01:09:46.870
And so, you know, the Title
17 is very long already.

01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:49.390
And if we start putting
new things in it

01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:53.640
that very quickly become irrelevant
or become no longer capable

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:57.530
of addressing the problems,
then I don't find--

01:09:57.530 --> 01:10:00.390
I don't think that that's a
helpful way to go about it.

01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:03.810
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: So, I hear you, but
Congress also implemented a variety

01:10:03.810 --> 01:10:06.780
of exceptions to the
prohibition on circumvention,

01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:08.320
which are these permanent
exemptions.

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:10.720 position:56%
I mean, should we treat these on par

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.850
with a continuously
renewed exemption or,

01:10:12.850 --> 01:10:14.150
you know, where is the line?

01:10:14.150 --> 01:10:18.090
Why have one for encryption but not
have one for assistive technology?

01:10:18.090 --> 01:10:19.390
&gt;&gt; Matt Williams: Sure.

01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:23.150
And I think you have to assess
every issue as it comes up.

01:10:23.150 --> 01:10:25.790
As I was saying earlier,
I think a lot

01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:32.660
of the permanent exemptions appear
to have largely done their job

01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:38.750
and that litigation is not taking
place that results in bad outcomes.

01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:42.380
And I think there's a lot of
people who seem to have concerns

01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:44.870 position:56%
about the scope of these exemptions.

01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:48.740
But there's not a lot of evidence
that if it actually got litigated,

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:50.750
they wouldn't have
addressed the problem.

01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:54.730
But that being said, the fact
that no one is content with them

01:10:54.730 --> 01:10:59.600 position:56%
to me indicates that no matter how
we work through over the next couple

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:03.070
of years creating new permanent
exemptions, someone's going

01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:04.730
to figure out a reason
why in a couple

01:11:04.730 --> 01:11:07.400
of years they're worried
they're not going to work right.

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:10.370
And they're going to come
to you with those concerns.

01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:13.380
And so, I feel like that
renders the legislative work

01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:18.590
that everyone would have
to do a little more suspect

01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:22.400
because there's already a
process that, as I said yesterday,

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:25.210
is working quite well
where the Office is able

01:11:25.210 --> 01:11:26.510
to address these things.

01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:30.510
And if you can get them renewed
in a much less burdensome fashion,

01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:36.090
that to me is far preferable to
going with the legislative route.

01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:37.390
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Mr. Love?

01:11:37.390 --> 01:11:44.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; James Love: I don't know if
you're aware of this, but we spent--

01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:47.160
I spent maybe five years of my
life working about half-time

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:49.170
on this, you know, on this issue.

01:11:49.170 --> 01:11:53.010 position:56%
So we've followed the debates on it.

01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:57.110
I'd call attention to-- I
mean, if you look at the--

01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:59.860
certainly, the temporary thing
has been a problem for the groups.

01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:02.980
There's been years when almost
no evidence was provided

01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:05.750
for the renewal, just because it
was such a burdensome proceeding.

01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:08.940
And it would have been-- And
there was a recommendation

01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:11.040
by the professional staff
to get rid of the exception

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.680
because the burden had been met
in the administrative proceeding.

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:18.310 position:56%
But I think the Library of Congress
wisely extended the exception anyhow

01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:21.250
because it recognized that it was
just such a failure of the process

01:12:21.250 --> 01:12:23.570
and that the need was still there.

01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:27.110
So, I think the idea of having a
permanent exception is appealing,

01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:29.740
or at least a more durable
exception in some ways.

01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:35.870
The language in the treaty
that people have referred to,

01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:42.120
which says that the-- that you
shall take appropriate measures

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:45.560
to make sure that beneficiary
persons can enjoy the limitations

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:49.900
of the exceptions that they
should have, is kind of the level

01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:52.440
of generality where
maybe the specifics

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:56.000
of how that's done could be
done more administratively.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.920
I'm sympathetic to the idea

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:01.840
that rigid statutory
frameworks are not necessarily

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:04.410
that appealing in a lot of cases.

01:13:04.410 --> 01:13:09.320
I know that there was an
earlier exception for the blind

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:13.200
that had a commercial
availability provision in it.

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:23.470
And there was a letter on the
21st of September, 2012 from NTIA

01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:29.350
to Maria Pallante that
discussed this issue.

01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:32.410
And some of this is I
think described in a note

01:13:32.410 --> 01:13:37.650
that Krista Cox is the
author of June 17th, 2013,

01:13:37.650 --> 01:13:42.560
Marrakesh note number four,
when Krista was working with us,

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:44.320
was addressing this issue.

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:45.940
And I would recommend that memo

01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:47.740
because I think it's
quite well-written

01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:51.290
and I think it's informative
on this point.

01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:55.400
But it's-- The finding by NTIA was

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:58.350
that the interoperability problem
had gotten worse, not better.

01:13:58.350 --> 01:14:01.090
The hopes was-- We always hear
these talks, you're not going to--

01:14:01.090 --> 01:14:02.890
you know, licensing
will solve the problem,

01:14:02.890 --> 01:14:05.350
technology will solve the
problem, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:09.560
But then, the thing that Krista
mentioned earlier about the cost

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:13.110
of obtaining different devices--
also in the context of the treaty,

01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:16.820
you saw people making
these presentations

01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:18.710
in the treaty negotiations
that would get up

01:14:18.710 --> 01:14:22.100
and they would show you what
was considered to be accessible.

01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:27.360
Like one blind person from South
Africa, he had had a PDF reader.

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:33.850
It would read an entire page
of text to him in the sort

01:14:33.850 --> 01:14:36.750
of permitted format that they
had accessibility where again,

01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:39.410
he was just trying to get the
footnote at the bottom of the page.

01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:41.950
And he'd try and copy it
down after he'd hear it.

01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:44.310
And then, he'd have to start it
again and again and he'd have

01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:45.860
to do it like several
different times

01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:49.340
because the reader he was using
didn't allow him to stop or cut

01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:51.020
and paste and things like that.

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:53.970
Whereas other readers that people
were using were designed more

01:14:53.970 --> 01:14:56.280
functionality and were
really easier to use

01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:58.200
and more effective for people.

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:02.010
Not only could you speed
up the process quite a bit,

01:15:02.010 --> 01:15:03.810
but you had other abilities to sort

01:15:03.810 --> 01:15:05.560
of utilize the text
in different ways.

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:07.950
I think people that are not
really familiar with it--

01:15:07.950 --> 01:15:10.180
I wasn't that familiar with
it myself and I started

01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:11.480
to learn about these things.

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:13.610
Just don't really understand
how high tech some

01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:16.910 position:56%
of the assistive technologies really
are and how idiosyncratic they are

01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:18.480
for the users and things like that.

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:23.430
So, for that reason, NTIA
really changed its position

01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:24.730
on the commercial availability

01:15:24.730 --> 01:15:26.870
because they just didn't think it
was really a workable standard.

01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:31.900 position:56%
Now, that said, I think this balance
between having a permanent mandate

01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:34.730
to do something that makes
people unequal in the way

01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:37.160
that you're supposed to
is the right approach.

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:41.740
And then, being able to
fine tune the details

01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:45.640
of how the exception is implemented
over time, probably a good idea.

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:46.940
My mother's deaf.

01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:50.160
She was one of the people who was
excluded from the Marrakesh Treaty

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:52.110
because the motion
picture industry insisted

01:15:52.110 --> 01:15:54.080
on that in the negotiations.

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:58.540 position:56%
Her situation's better today than it
was in the old days because we used

01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:01.320
to have to buy separate
devices to do kind of captioning

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:02.700
and now you can get that more--

01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:06.660
even Netflix has it these
days, which is kind of nice.

01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:10.170
But it is the case that it
was I think a disappointment

01:16:10.170 --> 01:16:13.970
that the Marrakesh Treaty on
print disabilities was as narrow.

01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:15.630
It was a political decision.

01:16:15.630 --> 01:16:18.220
But it also permitted countries
to implement them more widely.

01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:20.550
And I think US law is
wider in a lot of areas,

01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:21.890
certainly in the area of education.

01:16:21.890 --> 01:16:27.160
So I think that striking the right
balance as to how inclusive it is,

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:30.720
but also recognizing that maybe
the exceptions are maybe better

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:34.350
understood in some areas
of disabilities in terms

01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:38.290
of the overall effect on all the
stakeholders is probably accurate

01:16:38.290 --> 01:16:39.930
as well.

01:16:39.930 --> 01:16:44.480
So, you know, I think maybe--

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:46.290
sort of arguing against
myself a little bit--

01:16:46.290 --> 01:16:48.220
like sort of maybe sort of
giving like kind of like--

01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:52.140
accepting that you sort of know
what you're doing in some areas

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:54.040
and you know you should be
doing something in other areas,

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:55.730
but maybe you're not quite
as confident you know what

01:16:55.730 --> 01:16:59.790
that thing is just yet
is probably realistic.

01:16:59.790 --> 01:17:01.090
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:17:01.090 --> 01:17:02.950
I think we're going
to go to Ms. Koberidze

01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:06.360
and then back to Mr. Cazares.

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:09.000
&gt;&gt; Maryna Koberidze: I believe
there is a strong support

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.310
for a permanent exemption
for print-disabled people.

01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:16.960
And we have rulemaking
records since 2003.

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:21.330
We have case law, Authors
Guild v. HathiTrust.

01:17:21.330 --> 01:17:26.660
We have Chafee amendment and we
have also international obligations

01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:28.190
under Marrakesh Treaty.

01:17:28.190 --> 01:17:37.230
And although despite
all these regulations,

01:17:37.230 --> 01:17:44.530
print-disabled people still
cannot benefit from the exemptions

01:17:44.530 --> 01:17:47.530
that are granted within
the rulemaking proceedings.

01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:52.030
And this is because
they need accessibility

01:17:52.030 --> 01:17:53.930
and they need third
party assistance.

01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:57.360
And I think it would
be very important

01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:03.940 position:56%
when we consider permanent exemption
to consider these two issues,

01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:06.960
how to facilitate accessibility
and how

01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:09.510
to facilitate third
party assistance.

01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:12.600
Whether it will be through
mediation process, as I mentioned,

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:15.980
with the copyright holders
or whether it will be

01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:18.240
with help of the Copyright Office.

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:21.370
Or maybe, there could
be a third solution

01:18:21.370 --> 01:18:25.180
to create a separate
management organization similar

01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:28.150
to Sound Exchange in the
music industry which will help

01:18:28.150 --> 01:18:31.710
to manage third party
assistance issues.

01:18:31.710 --> 01:18:33.240
Thank you.

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:34.670
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you very much.

01:18:34.670 --> 01:18:35.970
Mr. Cazares?

01:18:35.970 --> 01:18:38.400
&gt;&gt; Gabe Cazares: I
think that a couple

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:39.720
of great points have been made.

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:43.540
I agree in part with Mr. Williams.

01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:50.800
I think that the forthcoming of
EPUB-3 and HTML-5 are going to kind

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:55.030
of revolutionize the way
accessibility is approached

01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:56.330
in the mainstream.

01:18:56.330 --> 01:18:59.610
But I also want to address the
fact of the permanent exemption.

01:18:59.610 --> 01:19:06.130
The fact is that people with
disabilities, particularly the AFB,

01:19:06.130 --> 01:19:07.610
the American Foundation
for the Blind

01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:12.730 position:56%
and other folks have been requesting
exemptions that have been,

01:19:12.730 --> 01:19:17.850
by and large, being renewed
with little to no opposition

01:19:17.850 --> 01:19:20.370
because the circumstances
really don't change

01:19:20.370 --> 01:19:22.060
for people with disabilities.

01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:27.500
I think given the notion-- the
fact that we have a large number

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:29.480
of people who are blind
or visually impaired

01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:33.350
in this country alone
guarantees a permanent exemption.

01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:36.880
I don't see the need, until
the process is reformed,

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:42.400
for the renewal-- the
rulemaking process,

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:47.120
I don't see the reason why
people with disabilities,

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:51.700 position:56%
people who are print-disabled have
to go through the burdensome process

01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:54.820
of requesting for and waiting

01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:58.410
to be granted another
three-year exemption.

01:19:58.410 --> 01:20:02.510
I think that this particular
circumstance, given the situation

01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:06.870
of blind and print-disabled
Americans,

01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:09.990
warrants a permanent exemption.

01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:12.410
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you very much.

01:20:12.410 --> 01:20:16.740
I think we have quite
broad agreement

01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:19.390 position:56%
on that topic, which is encouraging.

01:20:19.390 --> 01:20:24.360
We have-- We're getting
close to the end.

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:29.750
And so, I think we just had
one or two sort of suggestions

01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:32.700
for permanent exemptions that we
wanted to ask your views about.

01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:37.490
One proposal that came
up in the comments was

01:20:37.490 --> 01:20:41.270
to make the current
unlocking exemption permanent.

01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:46.970
We'd be interested in your views
on the advisability of that.

01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:53.900
Mr. Dow?

01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:57.970
&gt;&gt; Troy Dow: So, I think it was
Mr. Adler in the previous panel

01:20:57.970 --> 01:21:02.100
who read some from the legislative
history and the contextual part

01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:05.100 position:56%
of the unlocking-- the circumstances
of the unlocking legislation.

01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:07.570
And I think that that
counsels towards an approach

01:21:07.570 --> 01:21:10.510
that says a permanent
exception for that type

01:21:10.510 --> 01:21:12.540
of thing is really
not the way to go.

01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:15.290
And I think that's not
unique to unlocking per se.

01:21:15.290 --> 01:21:16.700
I think that really
applies when you're dealing

01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:20.450
with very technologically
specific items in general.

01:21:20.450 --> 01:21:25.430
But the one thing on the unlocking
legislation specifically was

01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:26.940
that the unique circumstances
of that was

01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:28.810
that we knew what that meant.

01:21:28.810 --> 01:21:30.450
We knew what it meant
to unlock a phone.

01:21:30.450 --> 01:21:32.660
We knew that what it meant was
the entry of a code, right?

01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:35.220
It was a handful of digits
that could be entered in.

01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:37.800
And the only thing that resulted
from the entry of those digits was

01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:40.100
that you could connect
that phone to a network.

01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:41.780
It didn't expose the
content on the phone.

01:21:41.780 --> 01:21:43.280
It didn't expose personal
information.

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:44.810
There weren't privacy
interests that were affected.

01:21:44.810 --> 01:21:46.110
There weren't copyright interests.

01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:48.380
It was a very narrow thing.

01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:50.010
But we didn't know what
that was going to mean

01:21:50.010 --> 01:21:51.490
for the next device, right?

01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:53.440
I mean, that was one of the
issues that we talked about,

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:55.740
should this be expanded
into the context of tablets

01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:57.820
and other computing devices, right?

01:21:57.820 --> 01:21:59.920
Does circumvention for the purposes

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:02.380
of connecting the device mean
the same thing in those contexts?

01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:04.830
Does it mean simply that you can
connect that device to a network

01:22:04.830 --> 01:22:06.810
or does it mean that all of a
sudden, it does implicate some

01:22:06.810 --> 01:22:10.200
of these other interests
that didn't exist at the time

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:11.770
of the cell phone unlocking
legislation?

01:22:11.770 --> 01:22:15.790 position:56%
And so, I think the legislative
history speaks specifically to that.

01:22:15.790 --> 01:22:17.760
It talks about that being
a unique circumstance

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:20.090
and why Congress was
comfortable doing it.

01:22:20.090 --> 01:22:24.210
And I think it speaks towards why,
in the context of trying to look

01:22:24.210 --> 01:22:26.520
at that for other devices
and in other contexts,

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:31.100
it really requires a specific focus
and one that's uniquely suited

01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:34.310
to something like the rulemaking as
opposed to the legislative process

01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:37.210
and the permanent exemption.

01:22:37.210 --> 01:22:38.510
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:42.550
Mr. Love? Oh, that was from before?

01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:45.740
OK. Anyone else want to weigh in?

01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:47.980
Ms. Koberidze?

01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:51.400
&gt;&gt; Maryna Koberidze: I
support this type of exemption,

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:57.120
although I understand it will be
very hard to agree on the language,

01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:03.760 position:56%
especially since, as was mentioned a
lot today, new devices are coming in

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:08.810
and it's very hard to predict
what kind of users and what kind

01:23:08.810 --> 01:23:12.050
of uses will need to be exempted.

01:23:12.050 --> 01:23:16.330
But we need to start
discussing it now

01:23:16.330 --> 01:23:20.180
because as the last
rulemaking showed,

01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:22.860
it will be-- it was the beginning.

01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:27.170
All those devices, smartphones,
TVs and medical devices.

01:23:27.170 --> 01:23:32.640
Now, we will have Amazon Alexa
and then we will have smart homes.

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:34.700
And everything will be connected.

01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:37.260
And a lot of security
testing would be needed.

01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:39.780
A lot of privacy issues will arise.

01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:44.320
And those will not be concerned
with the copyright law by itself,

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:47.340
but because a lot of those devices

01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:53.310
and technologies use
copyrighted material,

01:23:53.310 --> 01:23:57.340
which is computer programs,
it would be helpful

01:23:57.340 --> 01:24:03.430
to at least start drafting
some permanent exemption

01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:12.050
that will help us to start
moving in that direction

01:24:12.050 --> 01:24:15.310
of unlocking certain
devices for certain uses.

01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:17.730
Maybe, it would be
very narrowly tailored.

01:24:17.730 --> 01:24:22.600
But we can at least use the
rulemaking record to find

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:28.450
out which ones are more
important to make now.

01:24:28.450 --> 01:24:29.910
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Can I ask
just one follow-up question?

01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:32.330
Then I think we're going to
move to another proposal.

01:24:32.330 --> 01:24:36.440
But just should we consider
the specific narrow case

01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:39.370 position:56%
of unlocking your phones differently

01:24:39.370 --> 01:24:41.960 position:56%
than the broader jail-breaking
classes, right, where you're opening

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:44.420
up an activity-- you
know, host your devices,

01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:47.790 position:56%
the technology may work differently,
sort of going to Mr. Dow's point.

01:24:47.790 --> 01:24:51.700
And we may not know exactly what
software is being implicated

01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:54.060
for that?

01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:57.130
Should we treat unlocking
differently than jail-breaking?

01:24:57.130 --> 01:24:58.430
&gt;&gt; Maryna Koberidze: Yeah.

01:24:58.430 --> 01:25:02.330
What I'm talking about,
unlocking, it means I'm trying

01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:07.140
to just cover all the aspects,
including car tinkering

01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:10.020
and including jail-breaking.

01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:15.770
I don't expect those-- all
of those could be even become

01:25:15.770 --> 01:25:18.230
permanent exemptions.

01:25:18.230 --> 01:25:23.960
But, at least, wireless
devices, just unlocking,

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:26.180
to be able to change carriers.

01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:31.670
And it's interesting how the
rulemaking itself resulted

01:25:31.670 --> 01:25:35.660
in changes on the marketplace
because now, even if we look

01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:42.730
at the Amazon Alexa, the system is
open to third party applications.

01:25:42.730 --> 01:25:45.460
And we don't-- might
not need jail-breaking

01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:47.450
for that specific device.

01:25:47.450 --> 01:25:49.540
But changing-- at least
changing carriers,

01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:55.950
I think it could be very helpful
to have for the mobile devices.

01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:57.250
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: OK.

01:25:57.250 --> 01:25:59.870
So I think I'll go to Mr.
Williams next and then, I think,

01:25:59.870 --> 01:26:02.210
in your answer, you sort of
open up where we were going

01:26:02.210 --> 01:26:05.300
to go next anyways, which is sort
of repair and auto tinkering.

01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:08.130
So, if you would like to
comment on that, also feel free,

01:26:08.130 --> 01:26:10.020
since we're running short on time.

01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:12.090
&gt;&gt; Maryna Koberidze: Thank you.

01:26:12.090 --> 01:26:13.920
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Mr. Williams?

01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:15.220
&gt;&gt; Matt Williams: Thank you.

01:26:15.220 --> 01:26:19.860
Just on your last question about
how to handle jail-breaking,

01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:25.830
I would be opposed to trying
to create a permanent exemption

01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:29.050
for jail-breaking for the reasons

01:26:29.050 --> 01:26:32.230
that Mr. Dow expressed
related to unlocking.

01:26:32.230 --> 01:26:35.860
And also because even within
the context of the rulemaking,

01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:40.040
there have been things referred
to as jail-breaking proposed

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:43.500
that the Office has concluded
should not be granted.

01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:48.390
And going back to what I referred
to earlier and Mr. Dow referred to,

01:26:48.390 --> 01:26:53.990
the Linux situation with DVDs,
there are a number of times

01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:58.060
that people have sought
to impress on the Office

01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:01.670
that they were entitled to
access an expressive work

01:27:01.670 --> 01:27:03.500
on any device of their choice.

01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:07.360
And the Office has
concluded that's not correct.

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:11.440
And so, to try to craft
a permanent exemption

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:14.460
for jail-breaking the things
that the Office has concluded,

01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:17.970
you should be able to jail-break,
but not sweeping in the things

01:27:17.970 --> 01:27:21.640
that you've already concluded
you should not be able to hack

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:27.440 position:56%
and then also address future devices
and future products and services.

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:30.200
I think that would be
a very unworkable task.

01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:31.930
So I'd be opposed to that.

01:27:31.930 --> 01:27:33.230
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: OK.

01:27:33.230 --> 01:27:34.530
Thank you.

01:27:34.530 --> 01:27:36.620 position:56%
Mr. Love, and I'd ask you to keep it
short, just because we are running

01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:39.860
out of time for all of
our next commenters.

01:27:46.350 --> 01:27:49.850
&gt;&gt; James Love: Right now, the
Copyright Office is the decider

01:27:49.850 --> 01:27:51.150
on a lot of these things.

01:27:51.150 --> 01:27:54.860
And then, other agencies
petition the Copyright Office

01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:56.550
with their concerns.

01:27:56.550 --> 01:28:04.330
In the FDA proceedings right now,
there's been requests that the FDA

01:28:04.330 --> 01:28:11.700 position:56%
as a regulatory thing regulate some
of the technical protection measures

01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:15.200
on medical devices as part of
a broader work they're doing

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:20.090
on medical devices and hospital
networks in terms of cybersecurity.

01:28:20.090 --> 01:28:22.240
I'm just wondering if in
some cases, it makes sense

01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:25.050
for the Copyright Office
to farm out some--

01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:28.620
like in the jail-breaking
case, I mean, maybe the--

01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:30.810
I'm not sure that it makes
sense for the Copyright Office

01:28:30.810 --> 01:28:33.910
to be the be all and end all
of the decision-making in terms

01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:37.370
of future way you might
imagine doing.

01:28:37.370 --> 01:28:42.340 position:56%
Or should this be something that you
envision that other agencies could--

01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:46.390
I mean, does it always have to
be your rulemaking authority

01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:48.360
or could another agency
basically be--

01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:49.660
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:51.640
I mean, I do take your point and
in fact, in the last rulemaking,

01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:55.270
the Copyright Office did solicit
some viewpoints from other agencies

01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:59.760
when commenters had suggested that
it may fall under their bailiwick.

01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:01.060
I think the discussion

01:29:01.060 --> 01:29:04.330 position:56%
of jail-breaking is getting a little
fuzzy, whereas in the rulemakings,

01:29:04.330 --> 01:29:06.900
it's been referred to
opening up a device in order

01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:08.340
to install different apps on it.

01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:11.210
So it wouldn't-- that
wouldn't necessarily extend

01:29:11.210 --> 01:29:12.510
to medical devices.

01:29:12.510 --> 01:29:13.810
But I do take your point.

01:29:13.810 --> 01:29:15.320
And Mr. Mohr?

01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:20.620
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: Just quickly, I
mean, I think, you know, we--

01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:27.850
SIIA has had some experience
with trying to move I think

01:29:27.850 --> 01:29:30.390
in hindsight a bit too quickly.

01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:39.610
So, we were supporters of UCITA
and I was not representing them,

01:29:39.610 --> 01:29:41.390
but I was at many of
those drafting meetings.

01:29:41.390 --> 01:29:46.000
And what you had was somebody
trying to draft a statute

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:49.650
that codified practice that would
literally change every two months.

01:29:49.650 --> 01:29:53.610
We would have new language
proposed because AOL did something

01:29:53.610 --> 01:29:55.390
or CompuServe did something.

01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:58.060
And it just never stayed still.

01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:02.820
And I think in terms of for
a lot of the kinds of things

01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:05.830
that we are talking
about that the type

01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:10.780
of flexibility particularly
with, as Mr. Williams mentioned,

01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:13.980
the kind of streamlining
which we've discussed

01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:17.100
and which enjoys pretty
broad support, with that type

01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:23.750
of flexibility, I think you will
produce better policy results.

01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:25.530
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:30:25.530 --> 01:30:27.900
I know we're running out of time.

01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:29.660
I have one final question.

01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:31.790
Others may have other
questions about just some

01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:34.050
of the other permanent
exemptions, if anyone wanted

01:30:34.050 --> 01:30:35.580
to weigh in on them, there's one.

01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:38.970
For example, for privacy, you know,
if we can beat the hypothetical

01:30:38.970 --> 01:30:41.100
to death right now, is
it working if you want

01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:44.810
to turn off your smart refrigerator
so it doesn't spy on you

01:30:44.810 --> 01:30:47.000
or protection of minors,
analog devices.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.460
There's one for federal agencies.

01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:54.580
Does anyone else want to comment
on potential reforms to those?

01:30:54.580 --> 01:30:56.850
Mr. Perry?

01:30:56.850 --> 01:30:58.990
&gt;&gt; David M. Perry: I
thought you'd never ask.

01:30:58.990 --> 01:31:00.290
So--

01:31:00.290 --> 01:31:02.460
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: We appreciate
your patience.

01:31:02.460 --> 01:31:03.990
&gt;&gt; David M. Perry: That's OK.

01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:06.560
I won't repeat what was said
in the previous sessions.

01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:13.070
And our client is a player in
the auto after-market industry.

01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:21.760 position:56%
You know, we haven't-- to be honest,
I talked at length with our client

01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:27.040
about permanent-- the
permanency of the exemption.

01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:32.560
I think it's-- and I'm not really
sure what a streamlined renewal

01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:35.590
process would be as
distinguished from permanent,

01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:37.240
exactly how it would work.

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:41.220
I think if we liked the exemption,
we would want it to be permanent.

01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:43.880
We don't like this
exemption as it's written so,

01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:46.190
we haven't spoken about
it very much.

01:31:46.190 --> 01:31:51.870 position:56%
The class 21 exemption, as I pointed
out in the prior session, you know,

01:31:51.870 --> 01:31:55.500
sort of morphed from as it was
proposed to as it ended up.

01:31:55.500 --> 01:32:01.080
And some of the wording in
there with respect to on behalf

01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:04.370
of the owner or authorized owner,
you know, some of the wording

01:32:04.370 --> 01:32:08.680
in the exemption essentially
for the, you know,

01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:13.420
$200 billion auto after-market
industry sort

01:32:13.420 --> 01:32:16.120
of left them basically hanging.

01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:20.840
If you-- And a point I did not
make in the prior session was

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:25.280
and this may be the only
exemption of all the classes,

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:30.030
the class 21 exemption
really doesn't kick

01:32:30.030 --> 01:32:35.510
in for I think 12 months from when
it was originally promulgated.

01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:42.430
And it also has an explicit sort
of directive over to the DOT

01:32:42.430 --> 01:32:45.900
and the EPA, which sort
of ties in with a point

01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:51.430
that Mr. Geiger made earlier about,
you know, those laws are there.

01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:53.710
Do we need to have
the Copyright Office

01:32:53.710 --> 01:32:58.480
in an exemption essentially give
sort of a tentative shout-out

01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:02.120
over to the DOT and the EPA
saying we just want to make sure

01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:04.610
that what we're doing here isn't
going to violate your laws.

01:33:04.610 --> 01:33:10.890
So, just to be safe, let's not make
any of this happen for 12 months.

01:33:10.890 --> 01:33:14.240
And the effective result, at least
for the after-market industry,

01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:16.440
was to basically look at
this exemption and say, well,

01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:18.750
that basically didn't
really give us much

01:33:18.750 --> 01:33:22.470
of anything except maybe
another year to wait

01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:24.910
and see what litigation
is going to ensue,

01:33:24.910 --> 01:33:29.180
what kind of lobbying
is going to take place.

01:33:29.180 --> 01:33:37.200
And, you know, if you're, however,
if you are a car repair enthusiast,

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:41.290 position:56%
starting, I guess, in October of
next year, if you want to circumvent

01:33:41.290 --> 01:33:46.370
and fix your windshield wipers and
break into the chip that exists

01:33:46.370 --> 01:33:49.790
in there, I suppose this
exemption is for you.

01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:55.390
The reality is that it doesn't
help the average person.

01:33:55.390 --> 01:33:58.420
It doesn't help any of us, the
average person who drives a car

01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:04.060
who goes to their local mechanic,
which is about I think 70%

01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:07.640
of automobile after-market
repair is done through,

01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:08.940
you know, your local mechanic.

01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:10.440
It's not done at the dealer.

01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:16.270
Of course, this ties in hugely
to automobile manufacturers

01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:20.560
and big auto and all the
tensions between the automakers

01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:24.990 position:56%
and their own dealers, where there's
great tension, the after-market,

01:34:24.990 --> 01:34:26.910
where there's additional tension.

01:34:26.910 --> 01:34:31.510
And to Mr. Mohr's point earlier,
I mean, I think we fully agree,

01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:33.570
the expression versus function--

01:34:33.570 --> 01:34:36.760
functionality, that
dichotomy, it's not easy.

01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:38.300
It's not easy at all.

01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:42.880
Some cases I think with cars
are easier to see than others

01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:47.730 position:56%
if you're talking about a windshield
wiper or a door, you know,

01:34:47.730 --> 01:34:51.430
the button that turn, you
know, brings your windows down.

01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:58.080
But there are a lot of grey areas
in this so sort of a long answer

01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:00.930
to address a variety of
issues that came up earlier.

01:35:00.930 --> 01:35:06.110
But this particular exemption
in class 21 is so watered down

01:35:06.110 --> 01:35:09.680
and tentative that there's
no reason for us to want this

01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:12.990
to be permanent as written.

01:35:12.990 --> 01:35:14.930
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:35:14.930 --> 01:35:17.780
Ms. Koberidze?

01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:19.780
&gt;&gt; Maryna Koberidz:
I just wanted to add

01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:26.520
that even ask whether the wording
in our permanent exemptions subject

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:32.340
to privacy and security and other
regulations will resolve the

01:35:32.340 --> 01:35:35.110 position:56%
concerns expressed today and earlier

01:35:35.110 --> 01:35:39.580
in the roundtable regarding
privacy issues and safety issues.

01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:45.040
So, will it give some
deference to other agencies

01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:50.170
who are best positioned
to address those issues?

01:35:50.170 --> 01:35:51.470
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:55.680
Mr. Love, and then Mr. Dow,
and I think then we're going

01:35:55.680 --> 01:36:02.530
to open it up to the audience.

01:36:02.530 --> 01:36:05.780
&gt;&gt; James Love: If it was possible,
we would think it would be useful

01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:13.080
if the Copyright Office would
have a permanent exception in this

01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:18.760
to the extent of remedies to
anticompetitive practices.

01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:23.410
Or possibly you mentioned privacy,
maybe that's another area too

01:36:23.410 --> 01:36:25.800
that the Federal Trade
Commission would spell out.

01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:29.870
And it's like sort of the idea
of not just having this office

01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:32.750
but maybe kind of a
decentralized area where,

01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:35.120
in addition to whatever
you do, that another agency

01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:36.420
such as the Federal
Trade Commission,

01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:38.180
which deals with anticompetitive
practices

01:36:38.180 --> 01:36:42.740
and interoperability issues on
a regular basis may play a role.

01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:46.500
Also, I said this earlier in terms
of medical devices for the FDA,

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:51.660 position:56%
I think if the FDA asserts some
kind of role in the area of security

01:36:51.660 --> 01:36:54.900
of medical devices and networks,
I think that they should be able

01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:58.050
to extend the benefits
of an exception.

01:36:58.050 --> 01:36:59.350
And then, I think that
should be kind

01:36:59.350 --> 01:37:00.840
of be hardwired into the process.

01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:03.230
And the last thing I would
say, the final thing would be

01:37:03.230 --> 01:37:04.620
on the National Science Foundation.

01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:07.330
I think they should be able to
make similar recommendations

01:37:07.330 --> 01:37:09.610
as it relates to artificial
intelligence systems,

01:37:09.610 --> 01:37:13.800
which a topic which we addressed
in some of our comments earlier.

01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:15.100
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Thank you.

01:37:15.100 --> 01:37:16.400
And I just wanted to make clear,

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:20.020 position:56%
currently under the statute 1201(i)
is an exemption in the Copyright Act

01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:23.360
for the protection of personally
identifying information.

01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:26.050
So that's an existing
place to either accept,

01:37:26.050 --> 01:37:28.960
build off from, et cetera.

01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:30.260
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Mr. Dow?

01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:31.560
&gt;&gt; Troy Dow: OK, just very quickly.

01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:32.860
One thing that I think
we really haven't touched

01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:37.540
on has been the incentive value
of the rulemaking process.

01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:40.340
The rulemaking process
in part was adopted

01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:42.700
to give copyright owners
an incentive

01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:44.240
to use technological
protection measures,

01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:46.120
to apply them to protect
their works in ways

01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:50.070
that can accommodate non-infringing
uses because there was this process

01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:52.890
that said if you use these
things in ways that cut

01:37:52.890 --> 01:37:56.200
out non-infringing uses and impair
that, then there's the likelihood

01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:57.820
that you will wind up with
an exception that's going

01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:00.150
to allow people to hack into your
technological protection measures,

01:38:00.150 --> 01:38:02.180
an incentive built in there
to try and be responsible

01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:03.800
about the way you apply these.

01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:05.820 position:56%
And I think we've seen some of that.

01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:08.020
There was a comment I
think a few minutes ago

01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:10.420
about maybe some movement that
we have seen in the market

01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:13.450
for accessibility and perhaps
having something to do with some

01:38:13.450 --> 01:38:16.410
of the rulemaking proceedings
with respect to unlocking,

01:38:16.410 --> 01:38:18.930
and how that may have driven
the marketplace in some ways.

01:38:18.930 --> 01:38:21.320
Whether we're talking in security
research, whether we're talking

01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:24.750
in unlocking a and jail-breaking,
whether we're talking in licensing

01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:30.200
and we heard Mr. Turnbull earlier
talk about the willingness to talk

01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:33.570
about solutions to provide licensed
mechanisms to achieve these things

01:38:33.570 --> 01:38:37.480
because the backstop alternative
really isn't appealing.

01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:41.340
The rulemaking process,
the ongoing nature of it,

01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:42.680
provides those incentives.

01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:45.190
The permanent exceptions really
don't provide those incentives.

01:38:45.190 --> 01:38:47.910
If you have a permanent exception,
the incentive is really to say, OK,

01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:49.640
well I guess we have nothing there.

01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:51.130
That's just the way it is

01:38:51.130 --> 01:38:52.740
and there's no incentive
to work going forward.

01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:55.900 position:56%
So, I think it's just worth
remembering that there was a purpose

01:38:55.900 --> 01:38:59.040
to be served in the incentive
nature of the rulemaking.

01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:00.340
I think it works.

01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:03.750
I think it had some impact and
I think there's value to it.

01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:05.050
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:39:05.050 --> 01:39:06.430
We are overtime.

01:39:06.430 --> 01:39:08.710
So I think we're going to
have to leave it there.

01:39:08.710 --> 01:39:11.300
Thank you all very much.

01:39:11.300 --> 01:39:12.980
This was very helpful.

01:39:12.980 --> 01:39:17.810
And now, our final session is an
audience participation session.

01:39:17.810 --> 01:39:19.960
We have a microphone at the back.

01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:23.840
Oh, here it is at the front.

01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:29.520
And so, if you have signed up,
you're welcome to come forward

01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:33.150
and ask any questions or
make any comments either

01:39:33.150 --> 01:39:35.150
about this particular topic or any

01:39:35.150 --> 01:39:37.530
of the topics that
we've talked about.

01:39:37.530 --> 01:39:38.830
&gt;&gt; And you can still sign up.

01:39:38.830 --> 01:39:40.630
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: And
you can still sign up.

01:39:40.630 --> 01:39:51.130
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:39:51.130 --> 01:39:53.060
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Do we have
anybody who's already signed

01:39:53.060 --> 01:39:55.180
up who wishes to speak?

01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:59.140
No? All right, all right.

01:39:59.140 --> 01:40:01.440
Head on up.

01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:07.790
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: And if you
could just-- yeah, right.

01:40:07.790 --> 01:40:09.090
&gt;&gt; Brandon Butler: I can lean down.

01:40:09.090 --> 01:40:10.700
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: If you could
just identify yourself?

01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:12.000
I know who you are.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.300
&gt;&gt; Brandon Butler: Yes, of course.

01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:14.600
Absolutely.

01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:15.900
Brandon Butler, from the
University of Virginia Library.

01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:17.200
I just wanted to chime in.

01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:20.140
Earlier, there was a discussion
about the scope of Section 108

01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:25.470
and a question of whether in the
context of preservation activities,

01:40:25.470 --> 01:40:30.070
one would need to necessarily
violate the ban on circumvention

01:40:30.070 --> 01:40:34.080
for purposes of copying as
distinct for purposes of access.

01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:35.940
And the answer is absolutely yes.

01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:41.070
Best practices for preservation
and for access include

01:40:41.070 --> 01:40:43.770
to make multiple copies
in different formats,

01:40:43.770 --> 01:40:47.260
often in different locations
so that, you know, for example,

01:40:47.260 --> 01:40:51.940
you don't want to be pulling up an
emulator of an outdated DRM thing

01:40:51.940 --> 01:40:56.220
and the original file every time a
researcher wants to read that thing

01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:57.700 position:56%
that was on Salman Rushdie's laptop.

01:40:57.700 --> 01:41:01.700
What you would do is do that
once, export that content

01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:05.810
into an access copy and then try
not to ever have to do that again

01:41:05.810 --> 01:41:09.900
so that all that stuff stays safe
and not changed by the processes

01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:13.400
that you're applying in
order to preserve the thing.

01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:15.600
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you very much.

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:17.450
&gt;&gt; Brandon Butler: And
can I say one other thing?

01:41:17.450 --> 01:41:18.750
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Sure.

01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:20.190
&gt;&gt; Brandon Butler: Because I
was not on the earlier panel

01:41:20.190 --> 01:41:23.960
about the first panel yesterday,
I wanted to weigh in a little bit

01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:28.780
about the question of competition
issues and non-copyright interests

01:41:28.780 --> 01:41:33.170
that come into play in
the context of 1201.

01:41:33.170 --> 01:41:35.880
Someone mentioned earlier
on this panel, I think,

01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:38.620
the notion that other agencies
should be able to weigh in.

01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:44.100
And I just wanted to agree with
that, that if the question is,

01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:45.930
you know, if we're really thinking

01:41:45.930 --> 01:41:49.480
about overhauling the whole 1201
system, changing the legislation,

01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:52.750
not just thinking what can we do
without changing the legislation,

01:41:52.750 --> 01:41:55.250 position:56%
it would be great to have, you know,

01:41:55.250 --> 01:42:00.420
the agencies that really know
cars be the ones that drive

01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:03.650
so to speak the process
that has to do with cars.

01:42:03.650 --> 01:42:04.950
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Great.

01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:06.820
I mean, I hate to put you on
the spot during open mic time

01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:09.960
but currently, there is
consultation with NTIA

01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:14.120
and other agencies can
participate in the rulemaking.

01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:15.600
I think you saw a lot
of them did reach

01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:18.050
out to the Copyright
Office or we solicited them.

01:42:18.050 --> 01:42:22.030
So, you know, so is it broken and
in need of fixing or is it sort

01:42:22.030 --> 01:42:24.090
of working and you're
just saying I acknowledge

01:42:24.090 --> 01:42:25.770
that this is happening
and that's OK?

01:42:25.770 --> 01:42:29.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Brandon Butler: I think there is
a real risk that where the interests

01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:36.230
at the heart of the issue are, you
know, car safety or consumer safety

01:42:36.230 --> 01:42:42.750
or competition, that having
an agency that deals routinely

01:42:42.750 --> 01:42:45.170
with copyright issues
and with people who care

01:42:45.170 --> 01:42:50.330 position:56%
about copyright issues in the
driver's seat consulting the people,

01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:52.110
but ultimately the last word is

01:42:52.110 --> 01:42:56.220
in the copyright relevant
agency seems maybe

01:42:56.220 --> 01:42:58.030
like something that is not ideal.

01:42:58.030 --> 01:43:02.100
If we could move the driver's
seat over to the other agency

01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:05.250
and then they would consult with
you so you could weigh in and say,

01:43:05.250 --> 01:43:09.100
you know, no, there's not a problem
for the copyright industries,

01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:11.480
the primarily copyright-oriented
industries.

01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:12.950
This is about cars.

01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:16.360
It would make more sense for them
to control and to consult you

01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:18.080
than the other way around.

01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:20.840
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Yes, and I think
the Office has probably, you know,

01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:24.230
in our defense, has tried to
stick to the copyright interests

01:43:24.230 --> 01:43:28.750
or thinking of it under the title,
you know, of the Copyright Act.

01:43:28.750 --> 01:43:33.490
But that's good to consider.

01:43:33.490 --> 01:43:34.860
&gt;&gt;Harley Geiger: Can I
make a quick point on that,

01:43:34.860 --> 01:43:38.670
which is that we're not
really seeing the agencies

01:43:38.670 --> 01:43:41.450
that have relevant expertise in
these areas hold back either.

01:43:41.450 --> 01:43:46.460
So it's not as if though 1201
is keeping these agencies at bay

01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:48.130
and they're not issuing
their own regulations

01:43:48.130 --> 01:43:53.170
or their own legislative
proposals to enhance car safety

01:43:53.170 --> 01:43:57.860
or prevent hacking or
circumvention because of 1201.

01:43:57.860 --> 01:44:00.800
In many cases, we're
seeing both move forward.

01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:03.840
In the case of the FDA, they
just released their after-market

01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:07.750
cybersecurity guidelines
for medical devices.

01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:10.400
We saw NHTSA come out with--

01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:12.200
or at least support legislation

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:14.620
that would have addressed
hacking in cars.

01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:20.430
So it's unclear to us why-- like
what benefit 1201 is serving

01:44:20.430 --> 01:44:23.160 position:56%
for these agencies if they're coming
forward with their own proposals

01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:26.110
or in many cases, have
existing regulations anyway.

01:44:26.110 --> 01:44:27.410
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:44:27.410 --> 01:44:29.160
Mr. Adler?

01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:33.060
&gt;&gt; Allan Adler: At the
moment, my name is the only one

01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:35.170
on that sheet back
there, just so you know.

01:44:35.170 --> 01:44:36.470
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Oh, OK.

01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:37.770
[ Laughter ]

01:44:37.770 --> 01:44:39.580
&gt;&gt; Allan Adler: Yes, I just wanted
to make an additional comment,

01:44:39.580 --> 01:44:44.300
the discussion about the
accessibility exemption I think was

01:44:44.300 --> 01:44:48.060
very interesting when we,
as Mr. Williams indicated,

01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:52.430
do think that if we get the
streamlining process right

01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:54.990
for renewal, that renewal
with respect

01:44:54.990 --> 01:44:57.490
to the exemption is more
appropriate for all the reasons

01:44:57.490 --> 01:45:01.120
that were mentioned about
flexibility, and particularly

01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:04.000
because of the fact that
the market is changing.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.840
It's not changing fast enough.

01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:09.000
It hasn't changed to the point
where it is satisfactory.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.090
But it is continuing to change.

01:45:11.090 --> 01:45:14.340 position:56%
And that's the reason why commercial
availability was always discussed

01:45:14.340 --> 01:45:17.280
as an exception to the
exception, even when we talk

01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:18.910
about the Chafee Amendment.

01:45:18.910 --> 01:45:22.890
And I would point out that,
for example, the importance

01:45:22.890 --> 01:45:25.900
of access controls cuts in
many different directions.

01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:31.330
For example, we helped to validate
the legitimacy of Bookshare,

01:45:31.330 --> 01:45:36.370 position:56%
which was an authorized entity under
the terms of the Chafee Amendment

01:45:36.370 --> 01:45:40.190
that became the first
authorized entity to exist online,

01:45:40.190 --> 01:45:45.210
and to be able to provide access to
accessible format copies of works

01:45:45.210 --> 01:45:48.400
in digital forms on
a subscriber basis.

01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:51.700
And we supported that
and it was worth pointing

01:45:51.700 --> 01:45:57.370
out that Bookshare uses access
controls such as encryption

01:45:57.370 --> 01:46:00.880
to make sure that when these
materials are being delivered

01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:04.360
to beneficiary persons who
are entitled to use them,

01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:06.850
who need the accessible
format copies

01:46:06.850 --> 01:46:09.530
that they're being
delivered to the right people.

01:46:09.530 --> 01:46:11.980
I would also point out that
there was a lot of discussion

01:46:11.980 --> 01:46:13.760
about the Marrakesh Treaty.

01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:17.670
With respect to the TPM
provision of the Marrakesh Treaty,

01:46:17.670 --> 01:46:21.430
it's generally the view
that US law already complies

01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:25.130
with that language precisely
because of the exemption

01:46:25.130 --> 01:46:30.130
that has been created and renewed
in the 1201 rulemaking process,

01:46:30.130 --> 01:46:33.410
as well as a result of the
Chafee amendment itself.

01:46:33.410 --> 01:46:36.140
But with respect to the comment
I just made about Bookshare,

01:46:36.140 --> 01:46:39.140
I would also just point out
that there's an agreed statement

01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:42.590
that goes along with the
Marrakesh Treaty, that in referring

01:46:42.590 --> 01:46:49.910
to the TPM section, specifically
says that because the ability

01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:55.450
to transport across national
borders accessible format copies

01:46:55.450 --> 01:46:58.920
of works is what the treaty
provides for and intends to be able

01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:02.350
to facilitate, this
language was agreed upon.

01:47:02.350 --> 01:47:03.880
It's understood that to distribute

01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:07.120
or make available accessible
format copies directly

01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:10.460
to a beneficiary person in
another contracting party,

01:47:10.460 --> 01:47:12.680
it may be appropriate
for an authorized entity

01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:15.310 position:56%
to apply further measures to confirm

01:47:15.310 --> 01:47:19.280
that the person it is serving
is a beneficiary person

01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:23.270
and to follow its own practices
as described in the article

01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:27.100
that delineates what an
authorized entity is.

01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:30.730
So, access controls are going
to be important in order

01:47:30.730 --> 01:47:33.430
for the Marrakesh Treaty
to be a success,

01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:38.200
to make sure that not only can
accessible format copies be

01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:41.190
delivered across national
borders all around the world

01:47:41.190 --> 01:47:44.190
from an authorized entity
in one country to another,

01:47:44.190 --> 01:47:47.500
but as the treaty also provides,
from authorized entities

01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:50.650
in one country directly
to beneficiary persons

01:47:50.650 --> 01:47:52.400
in another country without having

01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:55.220
to have the intercession
of an authorized entity.

01:47:55.220 --> 01:47:59.340
So, I would also just mention that
we have emphasized the importance

01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:02.430 position:56%
of making sure that people
understand what an authorized entity

01:48:02.430 --> 01:48:05.380
is, that an authorized
entity indeed is willing

01:48:05.380 --> 01:48:10.040
to undertake what is necessary to
make the Marrakesh Treaty a success

01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:12.360
and to facilitate its
purposes properly.

01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:16.010 position:56%
And I hope that we will have support
from that with respect to others

01:48:16.010 --> 01:48:20.140
who commented favorably on
the notion of the importance

01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:24.480
of an accessibility
exemption in the 1201 process.

01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:26.780
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you very much.

01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:31.340
&gt;&gt; Derek Manners: Hello.

01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:32.640
My name is Derek Manners.

01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:34.270
I'm from the National
Federation for the Blind as well.

01:48:34.270 --> 01:48:36.190
I just wanted to comment briefly.

01:48:36.190 --> 01:48:38.380
I think there's a lot of agreement

01:48:38.380 --> 01:48:41.880
that the accessibility
exemption is important.

01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:44.980
I think it's nice to hear that
we're sort of debating about how

01:48:44.980 --> 01:48:48.130
to best preserve it, how to
make it easier for everybody.

01:48:48.130 --> 01:48:50.290
And I think there's
widespread agreement about that.

01:48:50.290 --> 01:48:54.670
One point I would like to make
though is that Mr. Williams

01:48:54.670 --> 01:48:58.760
in particular indicated that the
rulemaking process encouraged

01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:00.060
parties to work together.

01:49:00.060 --> 01:49:05.150
And I don't think that a permanent
exemption would discourage parties

01:49:05.150 --> 01:49:08.470
from continuing to work together
in particular because many

01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:12.050
of the entities, third party
entities that have been discussed

01:49:12.050 --> 01:49:15.240
that have to make things
accessible for the blind

01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:17.940
and for the disabled have
legal obligations to do

01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:20.510
so under Sections 504
of the Rehab Act

01:49:20.510 --> 01:49:22.660
and Titles II and III of the ADA.

01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:26.290
And so, there will be a continuous
dialogue on how to make sure

01:49:26.290 --> 01:49:29.630
that that's done well because they
have a legal obligation to do so.

01:49:29.630 --> 01:49:33.190
And that's going to require
buy-in also from the publishers

01:49:33.190 --> 01:49:35.810
and manufacturers to make
sure that it's not being

01:49:35.810 --> 01:49:38.690 position:56%
like Mr. Adler was talking about,
that there are controls to make sure

01:49:38.690 --> 01:49:40.820
that it's not, you
know, being abused

01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:43.090
or that copies aren't
getting leaked out.

01:49:43.090 --> 01:49:47.320
And so, I don't think that the
permanent exemption would be--

01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:50.810
would preclude continued efforts
to work together to ensure

01:49:50.810 --> 01:49:52.510
that blind people have access

01:49:52.510 --> 01:49:56.470
to accessible material while
still protecting the interest

01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:57.970
of the stakeholders.

01:49:57.970 --> 01:49:59.270
Thank you.

01:49:59.270 --> 01:50:01.280
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you very much.

01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:02.580
Did you?

01:50:02.580 --> 01:50:04.620
&gt;&gt; Krista L. Cox: Yeah, I just--
I mean, I wanted to clarify that,

01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:07.330
you know, I agree with Mr.
Adler that we can comply

01:50:07.330 --> 01:50:12.240 position:56%
with our treaty obligations by
renewing this exemption and ensuring

01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:15.110
that this exemption
continues to persist.

01:50:15.110 --> 01:50:19.000
My point was simply that having a
permanent exemption really makes a

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:22.360
lot of sense and it would ensure
compliance rather than risk,

01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:25.990
you know, at some point that
the exemption is not granted

01:50:25.990 --> 01:50:28.480
in the future.

01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:30.780
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:50:34.170 --> 01:50:35.470
&gt;&gt; Raza Panjwani: Good afternoon.

01:50:35.470 --> 01:50:37.470
Raza Panjwani, from
Public Knowledge.

01:50:37.470 --> 01:50:41.450
There are just a few general
comments I wanted to add based

01:50:41.450 --> 01:50:43.870
on this panel and some
of the prior panels.

01:50:43.870 --> 01:50:46.940
I would encourage the Office,
as it's undergoing this study,

01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:50.980
to adopt the lens of asking, what
was the bargain in Section 1201

01:50:50.980 --> 01:50:54.050
between rights holders and the
public, and is that bargain

01:50:54.050 --> 01:50:57.310
and the assumptions underpinning
that bargain about the marketplace

01:50:57.310 --> 01:51:00.160
and the incentives
actually functioning.

01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:02.900
And I think a great example
of considering that is

01:51:02.900 --> 01:51:05.900
that throughout the discussion,
we've heard some folks say

01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:08.620
that we think the exemption
process is working fine.

01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:12.430
We think the renewability
discussion is academic.

01:51:12.430 --> 01:51:15.800 position:56%
And most of the folks making those--
taking those positions are the folks

01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:17.100
on the rights holders' side.

01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:18.710
And I think it's important
to realize,

01:51:18.710 --> 01:51:20.620
as Professor Tushnet
put it yesterday,

01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:23.080
that there are asymmetries
in the process.

01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:28.130
That if the process is falling
short of its goal, for example,

01:51:28.130 --> 01:51:32.000
of providing the exemptions that
are necessary to the public,

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:35.670
that leaves the rights holders,
you know, whole in a sense,

01:51:35.670 --> 01:51:38.400
that the ban is working,
the 1201(a) prohibition

01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:40.590
on circumvention is still working.

01:51:40.590 --> 01:51:42.420
You know, the process only
isn't working for them

01:51:42.420 --> 01:51:44.860
when the exemptions go too far.

01:51:44.860 --> 01:51:49.600
And I think it's worth sort
of noting that because,

01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:51.070
especially I think the discussion

01:51:51.070 --> 01:51:54.600
about the renewability being
academic, I think is important

01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:56.000
to realize because
there have been cases

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.940
where exemptions haven't
been renewed.

01:51:58.940 --> 01:52:01.580
And I think for those on the
proponent side, it's not academic

01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:03.870
that there is a risk of
exemption not being granted,

01:52:03.870 --> 01:52:05.410
that the burden is on them

01:52:05.410 --> 01:52:07.740
to provide the proof
necessary to get the exemption.

01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:09.960
So I don't think that's
an academic discussion.

01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:11.910
And finally, on that
point, and especially tying

01:52:11.910 --> 01:52:14.600
into the accessibility discussion,
the example that Mr. Love brought

01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:17.120
up of footnotes not
being accessible.

01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:19.300
That might be a case where
someone might say, well,

01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:21.250
95% of literature is accessible.

01:52:21.250 --> 01:52:22.550
That's just an edge case.

01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:26.170
When you're the user and that
particular case implicates you,

01:52:26.170 --> 01:52:27.470
it's not an edge case.

01:52:27.470 --> 01:52:29.000
That is a failure of the system.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:32.340
And I think the exemption
process and the user carve-outs

01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:34.300
in the permanent exemptions
aren't meant

01:52:34.300 --> 01:52:36.120
to cover those edge
cases in particular.

01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:38.560
So I would urge the
Office to consider in terms

01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:41.910
of evaluating what the burden of
proof should be, is considering

01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:45.440
that edge cases don't necessarily
mean the system is working.

01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:47.570
Thank you.

01:52:47.570 --> 01:52:49.580
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you very much.

01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:51.470
Did you have another comment?

01:52:51.470 --> 01:52:55.320
No? OK. That's OK.

01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:57.700
Anyone else?

01:52:58.970 --> 01:53:02.140
Ms. Koberidze

01:53:02.140 --> 01:53:07.620
&gt;&gt; Maryna Koberidze: Just a quick
remark regarding accessibility.

01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:09.790
So, the rulemaking exemption

01:53:09.790 --> 01:53:14.360
for print-disabled people
was renewed since 2003.

01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:21.700
Today-- Now, it's 2016 and still,
there is statistics that over 90%

01:53:21.700 --> 01:53:27.860
of the books are not available
in the form for print-disabled.

01:53:27.860 --> 01:53:30.100
And even tech companies
like Microsoft,

01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:33.790
in their comments,
they agree on that.

01:53:33.790 --> 01:53:38.660
And they fail and they
acknowledge that they were not able

01:53:38.660 --> 01:53:42.080
to accommodate all the needs
of the print-disabled people.

01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:43.380
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:53:43.380 --> 01:53:44.890
Mr. Love?

01:53:44.890 --> 01:53:54.420
&gt;&gt; James Love: Well, I want to
mention I was contacted recently

01:53:54.420 --> 01:53:57.140
by someone who supported our work
in the past in different areas.

01:53:57.140 --> 01:54:01.120 position:56%
And he asked me a bunch of questions
about artificial intelligence.

01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:08.850
And I guess he was following a lot
of things that you're beginning

01:54:08.850 --> 01:54:11.900
to see more and more in
the literature of concerns

01:54:11.900 --> 01:54:17.900
about the potential, you know,
really almost existential threat

01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:24.550
or at least in some peoples minds,
these kind of things represent,

01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:25.850
different points of view.

01:54:25.850 --> 01:54:28.930
But then, there's like a wider
range of things about just

01:54:28.930 --> 01:54:31.640
as we get enveloped
more with software

01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:34.410
that we barely understand
what's going on in our lives.

01:54:34.410 --> 01:54:38.030
I mean, we're, you know, we're
being told what movies to watch or,

01:54:38.030 --> 01:54:40.410
you know, how to drive to work.

01:54:40.410 --> 01:54:44.410
I mean, it's just become such a
huge part of our life these days

01:54:44.410 --> 01:54:47.630
that this idea that you
need to audit and monitor

01:54:47.630 --> 01:54:52.220
and understand better these forces
which are shaping our lives.

01:54:52.220 --> 01:54:55.420
I don't think people are
really here to cut up with

01:54:55.420 --> 01:54:58.030
like how different life is today
than it was five years ago,

01:54:58.030 --> 01:54:59.930
10 years ago or 20
years ago in terms

01:54:59.930 --> 01:55:03.460
of the relationship
between us and software.

01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:08.840
And I think that it's important
to realize that being able to look

01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:14.090 position:56%
under the-- to have somebody to have
the authority to basically sort of,

01:55:14.090 --> 01:55:18.580
you know, take a look under the
hood to sort of see what's going

01:55:18.580 --> 01:55:23.370
on is going to become more
important, not less important.

01:55:23.370 --> 01:55:25.250
So, to the extent that
you're, you know,

01:55:25.250 --> 01:55:28.890
you're making the system
more leaky, not less leaky,

01:55:28.890 --> 01:55:30.940
I think that's a good
thing, not a bad thing.

01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:34.880
I just wanted to say that.

01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:36.180
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you very much.

01:55:36.180 --> 01:55:37.750
Oh, Mr. Williams?

01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:39.050
&gt;&gt; Matt Williams: Thanks.

01:55:39.050 --> 01:55:41.080
Briefly, I just wanted to return
quickly to something the gentleman

01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:45.180
from Public Knowledge just said
about considering, you know,

01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:49.170
is the bargain that was struck
in 1998, is that being met

01:55:49.170 --> 01:55:52.930
and are rights holders fulfilling
their end of the bargain.

01:55:52.930 --> 01:55:57.500
And I think if you look through the
several pages of our initial filing

01:55:57.500 --> 01:56:01.180
in this proceeding and in all
of our rulemaking filings,

01:56:01.180 --> 01:56:05.680 position:56%
you'll see that there is just a vast
array of new products and services

01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:09.510 position:56%
that have hit the market and that my
clients have been meeting their side

01:56:09.510 --> 01:56:12.770
of that bargain to the
best of their ability.

01:56:12.770 --> 01:56:16.360
And I just wanted to make sure
that that was on the record

01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:19.580
that I think consumers
have benefited greatly

01:56:19.580 --> 01:56:21.670
from the existence of 1201.

01:56:21.670 --> 01:56:23.650
That are all kinds of
products and services

01:56:23.650 --> 01:56:26.710
that no one would have
thought would be available,

01:56:26.710 --> 01:56:28.450
have been made available.

01:56:28.450 --> 01:56:29.750
Thank you.

01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:31.050
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you very much.

01:56:31.050 --> 01:56:32.610
That concludes today's session.

01:56:32.610 --> 01:56:35.870
Thank you all very much.

01:56:35.870 --> 01:56:39.730

of the Library of Congress.
