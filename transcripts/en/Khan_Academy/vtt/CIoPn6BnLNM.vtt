00:00:00.511 --> 00:00:02.809
- [Voiceover] We are asked,
"What numbers should replace

00:00:02.809 --> 00:00:05.836
"the A and B in the multiplication table?"

00:00:05.836 --> 00:00:06.894
So let's just make sure we can read

00:00:06.894 --> 00:00:08.777
this multiplication table.

00:00:08.777 --> 00:00:11.346
The way you think about it is,
if you wanted to figure out--

00:00:11.348 --> 00:00:12.700
It goes up to six.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.572
So if you want to figure
out what any number

00:00:14.572 --> 00:00:17.308
up to six times another
number up to six is,

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:18.943
this table will tell you.

00:00:18.943 --> 00:00:20.241
So for example, if you
wanted to figure out

00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:22.536
what three times two is, you say,

00:00:22.536 --> 00:00:26.040
"Ok, three. Let me take the
row that has this three in it.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.846
"And then the column for the two.

00:00:28.846 --> 00:00:31.747
"So three times two."

00:00:31.747 --> 00:00:34.604
So if you're in this row, the three row,

00:00:34.604 --> 00:00:36.603
and you're in the two column,

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:39.501
three times two is going to be six here.

00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:41.043
Or you could go the other way around.

00:00:41.043 --> 00:00:42.775
This 12, this means

00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:47.377
that 3 times 4 is 12.

00:00:47.377 --> 00:00:50.001
Or right over here, this 25.

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:52.308
Notice, this is the same row as this five

00:00:52.308 --> 00:00:54.646
and the same column as that 5.

00:00:54.646 --> 00:00:59.403
So it's saying that five times five is 25.

00:00:59.403 --> 00:01:01.909
And so you notice that
if you go in any row,

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.946
you're counting by that number
and if you go in column,

00:01:05.946 --> 00:01:07.738
you're also counting by that number.

00:01:07.738 --> 00:01:10.339
So for example, in this
two's column right over here

00:01:10.339 --> 00:01:11.606
you're counting by twos.

00:01:11.606 --> 00:01:13.814
Two, four, six, eight.

00:01:13.814 --> 00:01:16.110
In this five column,
you're counting by fives.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.311
Five, 10, 15, 20.

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:21.007
And that makes sense because
five times one is five.

00:01:21.007 --> 00:01:25.000
Five times two is 10.
Five times three is 15.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.043
Five times four is 20.

00:01:27.043 --> 00:01:29.208
And the same thing is
happening as you go up a row.

00:01:29.208 --> 00:01:31.509
Two, four, six, eight.

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.276
Because two times one is
two. Two times four is four.

00:01:35.276 --> 00:01:37.009
On and on and on, you're counting by twos.

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:38.641
Here you're counting by sixes.

00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:40.668
Six times one is six. Six times two is 12.

00:01:40.668 --> 00:01:44.568
Six times three is 18.
Six times four is 24.

00:01:44.568 --> 00:01:46.743
So hopefully now we understand
the multiplication table.

00:01:46.743 --> 00:01:49.576
And it is actually pretty cool
to just keep looking at it

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:51.074
and thinking about how it works.

00:01:51.074 --> 00:01:53.339
But let's answer their
question, what would A and B be?

00:01:53.978 --> 00:01:56.202
Well we have this A right over here.

00:01:56.202 --> 00:01:57.233
So one way to think about it,

00:01:57.233 --> 00:02:01.339
it needs to be whatever
four times four is.

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:05.535
And you might know that
four times four is 16.

00:02:05.535 --> 00:02:06.735
Four times four is 16.

00:02:06.735 --> 00:02:08.041
Or another way is, you could just go down

00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:09.841
this column and count by fours.

00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:13.569
Four, eight, 12 and
then you add four again.

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.272
12 plus four is 16.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.834
Now let's figure out what B is.

00:02:16.834 --> 00:02:18.670
And actually, let's do it that way.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.513
B is in this column so
we can count by threes.

00:02:21.513 --> 00:02:25.805
Three, six, nine. Add three
to that and you get to 12.

00:02:25.805 --> 00:02:27.569
So b could be 12.

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.345
Or you could go from the row.

00:02:29.345 --> 00:02:32.735
You could go four, eight, add
four to that and you get 12.

00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:35.437
And that makes sense
because this, where B is,

00:02:35.437 --> 00:02:38.968
that should be whatever
four times three is.

00:02:38.968 --> 00:02:41.109
Cause four times three is 12.

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:43.965
Then they say, "Complete the inequalities

00:02:43.965 --> 00:02:47.871
"with the greater-than,
less-than or equal symbol."

00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:52.945
So A is greater than B. Greater than.

00:02:52.945 --> 00:02:54.646
And I always remember
the greater than symbol

00:02:54.646 --> 00:02:58.412
because it is opened
to the number on left.

00:02:58.412 --> 00:02:59.778
The number on the left is greater than,

00:02:59.778 --> 00:03:01.744
it's opened to larger number.

00:03:01.744 --> 00:03:04.808
A is greater than B
because four times four

00:03:04.808 --> 00:03:07.639
is going to be greater
than four times three.

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.402
Is greater than four times three.

00:03:10.402 --> 00:03:13.011
All right, four times four is
greater than four times three.

00:03:13.011 --> 00:03:14.209
It makes sense.

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.601
If four times four is four fours

00:03:17.601 --> 00:03:20.067
and if four times three is three fours,

00:03:20.067 --> 00:03:21.977
you have more fours here.

00:03:21.977 --> 00:03:23.375
So hopefully that makes sense.

00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:26.336
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:03:26.336 --> 00:03:27.976
So now what number should replace A and B

00:03:27.976 --> 00:03:29.629
in the multiplication table?

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:31.079
So same idea.

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.480
So A should be whatever
four times five is.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.178
So it should be 20.

00:03:37.178 --> 00:03:39.504
Or you could look at whatever
row or column it's in.

00:03:39.504 --> 00:03:43.577
If you look at its
column, five, 10, 15, 20.

00:03:44.343 --> 00:03:45.976
Now let's do the same thing for B.

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:50.976
B should be whatever five times four is.

00:03:51.112 --> 00:03:52.644
Well that's going to be 20 as well.

00:03:53.601 --> 00:03:54.940
That's going to be 20.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.413
And you could say, "Well
look, A is gonna be

00:03:56.413 --> 00:03:58.778
"four times five which is 20.

00:03:58.778 --> 00:04:02.803
"And B is gonna be five
times four which is 20."

00:04:02.803 --> 00:04:04.973
So either way you look
at it, they are the same.

00:04:04.973 --> 00:04:06.300
So, complete the inequalities?

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.333
Well, A is equal to B
because four times five

00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:11.143
is the same thing as five times four.

00:04:11.143 --> 00:04:13.409
It doesn't matter what
order you multiply them in.

00:04:14.172 --> 00:04:15.381
Let's do one more of these.

00:04:15.937 --> 00:04:17.104
I think you're getting the sense of it.

00:04:17.104 --> 00:04:18.446
So what is A?

00:04:18.446 --> 00:04:21.837
So we see where it's located,

00:04:21.837 --> 00:04:25.409
it's in this row for this two
and the column for the six.

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:28.433
So it needs to be
whatever two times six is.

00:04:28.433 --> 00:04:29.670
Which is 12.

00:04:30.543 --> 00:04:33.941
And you could count by sixes. Six, 12.

00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:34.571
Or you could count by twos.

00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:37.934
Two, four, six, eight, 10, 12 to get to A.

00:04:38.473 --> 00:04:42.738
Now B, this is going to be
whatever six times 2 is.

00:04:42.738 --> 00:04:46.171
Well, that's gonna be 12 again.

00:04:46.171 --> 00:04:47.770
And so it's just like the last one we saw.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.644
A is gonna be equal to B

00:04:49.644 --> 00:04:53.169
because two times six is
equal to six times two.

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.011
Let's do one more, this
is actually a lot of fun.

00:04:56.911 --> 00:05:01.433
All right, so A is
whatever four times one is

00:05:01.433 --> 00:05:03.504
which we know is gonna be four.

00:05:03.504 --> 00:05:05.770
B is gonna be whatever one times four is

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.434
which is also gonna be four.

00:05:07.434 --> 00:05:09.010
And I think you see a pattern here.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.945
A equals B because four times one

00:05:10.945 --> 00:05:13.741
is the same thing as one times four.
