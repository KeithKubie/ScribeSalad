finally closed with a discussion not
 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.500
finally closed with a discussion not
only of the cloud

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510
only of the cloud
 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.210

continues to be a very important item
all around the world and if you think

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010
all around the world and if you think
 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.220
all around the world and if you think
about smart grids and how we get power

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230
about smart grids and how we get power
 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.920
about smart grids and how we get power
and in order to operate the cloud wean

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930
and in order to operate the cloud wean
 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.400

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140
power and how do we make sure as you
 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.740
power and how do we make sure as you
think about the cloud that the early

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750
think about the cloud that the early
 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.690
think about the cloud that the early
pioneers of using the cloud are also

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700
pioneers of using the cloud are also
 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.820
pioneers of using the cloud are also
thinking about not only to how we

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830
thinking about not only to how we
 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.339
thinking about not only to how we
provision the capability how do we

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349
provision the capability how do we
 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.170
provision the capability how do we
provide it in a sustainable and

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180
provide it in a sustainable and
 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.289
provide it in a sustainable and
efficient way and that the fact that

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299
efficient way and that the fact that
 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.559
efficient way and that the fact that
cloud lends itself to embracing some of

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569
cloud lends itself to embracing some of
 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:12.789
cloud lends itself to embracing some of
the other things we're trying to get

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799
the other things we're trying to get
 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.220
the other things we're trying to get
done around sustainability and around

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230
done around sustainability and around
 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.340
done around sustainability and around
efficiency and around our climate so we

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350
efficiency and around our climate so we
 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.259
efficiency and around our climate so we
have a very unique opportunity here to

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269
have a very unique opportunity here to
 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.960
have a very unique opportunity here to
bring together two incredibly important

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970
bring together two incredibly important
 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.310
bring together two incredibly important
initiatives to raise the bar if you will

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320
initiatives to raise the bar if you will
 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.430
initiatives to raise the bar if you will
in providing people the opportunity to

grateful analysts were in a class by
 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:46.990
grateful analysts were in a class by
themselves and I think this is the topic

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000
themselves and I think this is the topic
 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.400
themselves and I think this is the topic
that we're going to continue to talk
