00:00:01.259 --> 00:00:04.426
(electronic clicking)

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.757
(calm music)

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.270
- So good afternoon.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.990
My name is Vince Resh and I'm a professor

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.770
of the graduate school and the Department

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.200
of Environmental Science,
Policy &amp; Management

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.160
at Berkeley and I feel like I've been

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.330
the lifelong chair of the
Hitchcock Memorial Lecture Series

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.850
and it's been one of the real joys

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.993
that I've had at being at Berkeley.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.100
Our committee along with
the Graduate Council

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.130
is pleased to present Dr. Eugenie
Scott as this full speaker

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.870
in the Charles M. and Martha
Hitchcock Lecture Series.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.870
Now as a condition of the request,

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.770
and we're happy to do this actually,

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:06.780
we wanna tell you a little about

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.380
how this endowment came to Berkeley,

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.570
and there's more information
in the brochure about this,

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.630
because it's really a
story that exemplifies

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.290
the many ways that the campus is linked

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.710
to the history of California

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.333
and especially to the Bay Area.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.120
Dr. Charles Hitchcock was a physician

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.450
in the United States Army
that came to California

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.320
during the Gold Rush.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.140
He opened a thriving
practice in San Francisco.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.710
And in 1885 he established
a professorship at Berkeley

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.933
as an expression of his long
held interest in education.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.440
His daughter was Lillie Hitchcock Coit

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.220
who's one of the fascinating characters,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.910
and many of you have
probably been to Coit Tower

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.110
to see the beautiful murals
that her family was involved in.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.210
And a very, very colorful personality.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.480
She expanded her father's original gift

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.330
and made it possible for us to present

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.710
this series of lectures.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.650
So over 100 years later, 130 years later,

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.800
the Hitchcock Fund has been one

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.950
of the most cherished endowments
on the Berkeley Campus

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.850
recognizing the highest
distinction of scholarly thought,

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.400
achievement, and accomplishment.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.850
Thank you to the Lillie
and Charles Hitchcock,

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.010
and now let me open with a few words

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.903
about Dr. Eugenie Scott.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.270
Dr. Scott is a renowned anthropologist

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.900
and science educator.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.790
She became the Executive Director

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.040
for the National Center of
Science Education in 1986.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.470
The center, as many of you know,

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.070
is a non-profit organization
based in Oakland

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.947
whose stated mission is
"to defend the integrity

00:02:36.947 --> 00:02:41.431
"of science education against
ideological interference."

00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:43.540
Dr. Scott headed the center for 30 years

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.610
before retiring in 2014.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.810
Now our speaker received
her BS and MS degree

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.670
from the University of
Wisconsin, Milwaukee,

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.490
and her PhD in Biological Anthropology

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.560
from the University of Missouri.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.290
She later joined the faculty
of the University of Kentucky

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.420
as a professor Physical Anthropology.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.230
She's taught at the University of Colorado

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.913
and Cal State University, East Bay.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.010
At the National Center
for Science Education,

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.360
Dr. Scott's work centered on attempts

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.180
to teach evolution as simply

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.530
one of a series of hypotheses
about human origins

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.490
such as ever teach creation science

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.840
and intelligent design in
American public schools.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.360
In 2005 she and her
staff worked on the side

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.380
of the plaintiffs in the well-known

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.320
Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.690
This was the first case
in the US federal courts

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.150
to directly challenge the teaching

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.970
of intelligent design in public schools

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.310
alongside with darwinian education

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.563
as an alternative scientific theory.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.740
The US District Court for
Middle District of Pennsylvania

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.550
ruled in favor of the plaintiffs
that intelligent design

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.320
was indeed a form of creationism

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.360
and therefore its teaching violated

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.790
the establishment clause
of the First Amendment

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.123
of the US Constitution.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.277
A prolific author, Dr. Scott's 2004 book

00:04:03.277 --> 00:04:06.010
"Evolution versus
Creationism. An Introduction",

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.780
offers an overview of the ongoing

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.920
public dispute and concise history

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.120
of the controversy surrounding
evolution and creationism.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.760
In addition to writing she is considered

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.440
among media and press coverage.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.013
In 2010 the National Academy of Science

00:04:20.013 --> 00:04:22.920
awarded Dr. Scott the Public Welfare Medal

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.040
for Extraordinary Use of
Science for the Public Good.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.850
Now some of you may know this analogy

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.260
that's been applied to Dr. Scott.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.440
If you remember back in Darwin's time

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.710
they referred to Huxley
as Darwin's bulldog.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.690
They've also referred to
Dawkins, Richard Dawkins,

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.940
as Darwin's greyhound which is

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.340
Eugenie once said that's not

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.670
necessarily a compliment
if you know greyhounds.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.320
But she has been described

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.793
in a beautiful, eloquent terms
as Darwin's golden retriever.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.750
So in her lecture today Dr. Scott asks,

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.580
why do people reject good science?

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.220
Now, reasonable research has highlighted

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.160
the importance of ideology in shaping

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.250
what scientific inclusions are

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.390
that are considered
reliable and acceptable.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.770
And of course this
research is quite relevant

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.830
to the evolution in climate change wars

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.560
and to other questions involving

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.930
the rejection of empirical
scientific evidence.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.050
I've been a fan of Dr. Scott's for years

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.710
and it's really a pleasure,

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.965
so join me in welcoming her to Berkeley.

00:05:24.965 --> 00:05:27.715
(crowd applauds)

00:05:32.162 --> 00:05:33.880
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you for coming.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.266
- Thank you, Vince.

00:05:35.266 --> 00:05:38.651
(crowd applauds)

00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:40.769
Thank you very much.

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:43.980
You know, actually greyhounds
are pretty cool dogs

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.040
when you come right down to it.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.966
It's golden retrievers that are,

00:05:48.966 --> 00:05:50.970
they're really nice dogs and everything,

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:51.970
but they're kind of dumb.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.970
But they just wanna get
along with everybody.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.998
So we'll see if you pick up
on any of that in this story.

00:05:57.998 --> 00:06:00.170
Thank you very much, Vincent.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.340
As Dr. Resh said I've spent
most of my professional life

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.590
at the National Center
for Science Education,

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.250
so I have been dealing a lot

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.630
with people who don't
agree with scientists

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.890
even on topics like evolution

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.540
which is foundational to
entire academic disciplines.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.230
So for a long time I've been interested

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.610
in this question of why do
people reject good science.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.213
Now there are a lot of things
that people get wrong, okay?

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.920
You know that Woody Allen joke about

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.670
I just finished the Evelyn
Woods reading dynamic scores.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.840
In four hours I read War and Peace.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.258
It's about Russia.

00:06:40.258 --> 00:06:42.360
(crowd laughs)

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.870
People believe that eyewitness accounts

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.890
are really highly reliable,

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:51.250
and one of my favorites, we
only use 10% of our brain.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.720
Like 90% our Brian is just sitting there.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.993
I don't know what to do.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.950
But there are a lot of things
that we're wrong about.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.830
But stuff like this tends to be

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.920
changeable with more information.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.430
If you explain to somebody why

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.230
I only use 5% or 10% of my
brain really isn't accurate,

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.490
most people will say,
oh, okay, that's fine.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.410
But then there's a whole bunch of stuff

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.130
that people are wrong about

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.240
which seem not to be very susceptible

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.760
to changing with new information.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.830
The 9/11 Truthers, the
creationist, climate deniers,

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.890
aficionados of the moon
landing being a hoax,

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:35.080
providing more accurate information

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.760
doesn't seem to change their opinions

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.050
or make them alter their erroneous views.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.620
So there seem to be some erroneous ideas

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.060
that people change their
minds about and others that

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.893
about which they are
quite knowledge resistant.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.240
Now we as individuals in a society

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.230
have to make decisions that
require accurate information.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.175
Sometimes this information
comes from science.

00:08:01.175 --> 00:08:06.130
If my baby gets a measles,
mumps, rubella vaccination,

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.130
will my child get autism?

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.683
Are GMO foods safe to eat, et cetera.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.160
I'll mostly be talking about two fields

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.620
about which, in science,

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.410
about which I have most expertise

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.090
which is evolution and climate science.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.410
But there are a lot of
things that people get wrong,

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:28.410
that people need scientific
and other factual information

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.060
to make good decisions.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.010
So let me just set the stage

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:34.910
by taking a look at those two fields

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:36.400
of evolution and climate change

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.123
and how the public looks at them.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.270
Now anti-evolutionism in the United States

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:45.350
has had a depressingly consistent past.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.200
The top line is Gallup's question

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.360
about human beings were created

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.160
in their present form
about 10,000 years ago.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.470
Traditionally about 40, mid
to high 40% of Americans

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.293
have answered yes to that question.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.690
In the last couple of
years, interestingly enough,

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:04.790
it's been declining.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:09.540
And in 2017 it was below
40% for the first time.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.740
The middle line is Gallup's
question that humans evolved

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.550
but God guided this process.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.770
A point of view in religious circles

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.560
known as theistic evolution,

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.300
and this question is usually

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.617
answered by about mid-30%,

00:09:25.617 --> 00:09:28.373
35, 37% of Americans.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.130
Increasing recently to the high 30s

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:35.780
which is kind of interesting because

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.020
the Young-Earth creationists

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.500
are sort of going down at the time

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.640
the theistic evolutionists are going up.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.660
That's a correlation,

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.130
we don't know if there's
any causation in there.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.100
The bottom line is Gallup's question

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.370
about humans evolved, but sorry.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:53.490
Humans evolved but God was
not involved in this issue.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:57.620
Now this question has
been answered by Americans

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.230
in roughly the low teens,

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.770
even eight, nine, 12, 13%.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:07.040
It's been on a rise
during the last decade.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.950
And interestingly enough in 2017

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:14.750
it was the highest that it's
ever been recorded, 19%.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.010
In any regard whatever
the percentages are,

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.720
Americans have a much lower

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.970
incidence of acceptance of evolution

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.080
than people in literally any

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.950
other developed country in the world.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.130
Climate change is a little better.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:33.340
And the 2017 study published by

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.240
the Yale Program on Climate
Change Communication

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.210
showed, this is the black line there,

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.470
over half of registered voters

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:43.050
accept that global
warming is caused mostly

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.820
by human activities.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.310
Now of course if you go to most of Europe

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.370
and most of Asia the percentages

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:51.230
are like 60, 70, 80%.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.610
But the fact that we're
over half is progress

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:58.930
'cause this is the highest
it's been for a long time.

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.360
The blue lines show that Democrats,

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.400
both liberal Democrats and
moderate conservative ones,

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.030
had a higher acceptance
rate than Republicans,

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:11.130
and the red line show that Republicans

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.280
in general are less favorable

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.760
to accepting anthropogenic climate change.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.160
When we compare attitudes
of the public to scientists,

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.380
we find quite a large gap
in several science issues.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.160
I wanna use as my starting example

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.940
the top line of this chart,

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.870
is it safe to eat
genetically-modified foods?

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.170
88% of scientists say yes,

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.220
37% of the general public.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.660
That's a 51 point gap

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.780
between the acceptance of this principle

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:44.830
from scientists versus that
of the general population.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.840
There are 37 and 33% point gaps

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.650
between scientists and the public

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:53.040
on climate change and human
evolution respectively.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.563
So how come?

00:11:56.250 --> 00:12:00.510
Well, maybe knowledge
resistors are just stupid.

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:02.850
Maybe the 9/11 truthers and creationists

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.560
and those who reject anthropogenic

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.010
climate change are just dumb.

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.420
I suspect this is highly unlikely.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.540
Nobody's out there giving IQ tests

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.300
to 9/11 truthers or anybody else.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:19.300
But from what we have seen
and talking to these people,

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.840
my hypothesis would be, and I
think it could be corroborated

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:28.580
that there's the same range
of normal intelligence

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:32.010
amongst deniers of these scientific views

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:33.360
as well as anybody else.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.010
I don't think stupidity
is really the answer.

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:37.623
Maybe they hate science.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.110
Well, this is something that
we can actually look at.

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:45.360
So how many of you think
Americans are anti-science?

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.420
And I won't call on you
so it's safe to raise

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.629
your hand, it's okay.

00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:50.680
See, a lot of you raised your hand.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.610
Oh, she's not gonna call on me, it's okay.

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:54.690
So quite a few of you did raise your hand.

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:58.210
Well, let's take a look and
see what the data is saying.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.870
Well, if Americans are anti-science,

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:02.600
they're keeping it a secret

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.810
because pretty much every
survey for the last 30 years

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:08.740
that I've seen, and believe me

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.510
I obsess about things like this,

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:14.540
shows that Americans are
very positive about science

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:17.810
in this recent Pew Research Center data.

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:19.930
The majority of Americans believe

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:24.690
science has a mostly positive
effect on society, 67%.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:26.990
That's a really large number.

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.770
Only 4% of our fellow citizens

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:32.720
feel that science has a
mostly negative effect.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.800
And there's other indicators as well.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.420
A somewhat earlier Pew study

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.430
show that Americans
find science beneficial.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:43.160
79% think science has made life easier.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.310
And in terms of health care,

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:46.830
food supply and the environment,

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:48.760
very high percentages of Americans

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.763
also think that science
has had a positive effect.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.240
If Americans were anti-science

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.030
they would not be likely
to trust scientist

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:03.550
to be reliable sources of
information on important issues.

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:07.610
The health risks of the MMR
virus, or sorry, vaccine.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:12.000
We know the health risks of
the MMR, more viruses than one.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.610
The causes of climate change,

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:16.500
the health risks, and
benefits of eating GMOs.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.440
Notice that Americans are more likely

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.680
to go to scientists for information

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.890
on these questions that they might have

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:26.630
than two other people
who might have expertise

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.980
in this issue.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.673
You might notice where
elected officials are.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:33.973
Interestingly enough.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:39.160
In this 2014 Harris Poll on
occupations and prestige,

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.710
scientists are right
up there with doctors,

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:43.510
firemen, and the military

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.840
as high prestige occupations.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.180
And in what I think was a
most interesting question,

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.000
would you want your kid

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.660
to think about a career in these fields?

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.930
When people are asked this question,

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.390
scientists again are right up there

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:02.500
with doctors and engineers.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:07.060
By the way politicians are
really low on this list.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.670
And there's lots and lots of polls showing

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:13.330
these similarly positive
responses to science.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:17.083
So how many of you think that
Americans are anti-science?

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.293
There are still some
knowledge-resistant people out here.

00:15:23.791 --> 00:15:24.806
All right.

00:15:24.806 --> 00:15:26.750
(laughs)

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:30.400
My hypothesis on this is that

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.320
Americans really like science.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.280
I mean we're very positive about science.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.720
All the survey research data shows that

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.757
grandma got a new hip,
she's bowling again.

00:15:38.757 --> 00:15:41.870
We really, really like science.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:44.630
But we just don't like that science.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.910
We just don't like this science.

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:49.670
I think we pick and choose the sciences

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.580
that we don't like.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.130
But in general science has got good press

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:55.630
which I think is very positive

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.570
for those of us who are
interested in science.

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:00.690
Denying climate change or evolution

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:03.193
is not the same as denying science.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.510
Maybe people who reject
the scientific consensus

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:09.790
on issues are just ignorant.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.650
Noting of course that
there is a difference

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.100
between stupidity and ignorance.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.153
One is curable.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:19.670
This would be very good to know because

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:23.470
if the reason why people
reject scientific views,

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:25.440
which are well founded in science

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:30.180
is because they don't
know enough about it.

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.470
If more information
could change their mind,

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.553
this would be a really good
solution to this problem.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.120
If it's just ignorance,

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.730
if we provide them with more information,

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.910
they'll change their
opinions, this is great.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:46.250
It is clear that this is the opinion

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:48.983
of about 89% of the people
who are on the internet.

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:52.662
It's a joke.

00:16:52.662 --> 00:16:54.280
(laughs)

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.010
If you carry it says,
aren't you coming to bed?

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:58.550
I can't, this is important.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:59.383
What?

00:16:59.383 --> 00:17:01.223
Someone is wrong on the internet.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:03.170
When I first started dealing

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.000
with the creationism and evolution issue,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.140
I really thought that if I could only

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.710
explain the science
really, really clearly,

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.523
come up with gripping examples,

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.850
communicate my excitement and enthusiasm

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:17.840
of the science that
people would say, yeah,

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.210
okay, you can teach this stuff to my kid.

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:22.190
Didn't work out that way.

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:26.440
I learned fairly early
in my career at NCSE

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.920
that you can't just shovel more science

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.680
under this topic and expect it

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.650
to make any difference.

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:35.560
People who's wrong in the internet,

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.390
people will always come
up with reasons why

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:40.710
they cant' accept your information.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:43.560
This is called the
knowledge deficit model.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.360
And it has to do with the idea that

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.660
knowledge resistance if
the function of ignorance.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:52.930
Cure the ignorance, the knowledge
resistance will go away.

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:56.830
Unfortunately reality is a
lot more complex than that.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:59.110
Dan Kahan and his colleagues at Yale

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:01.560
surveyed a group of Americans.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.710
They asked them about their
attitudes toward climate change

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:06.390
and they also collected information

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.990
on their general scientific knowledge

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.800
and mathematical ability.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.740
And the hypothesis is that if ignorance

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.520
is the explanation for
knowledge resistance,

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.770
then we'd expect that
people who know more science

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.680
would be more likely to
agree with scientists.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.210
And what they found was that
the more knowledgeable people

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:28.830
tended to be less concerned
with climate change

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:32.120
which is not what the knowledge deficit

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.670
model would predict.

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:36.623
And there's a lot of other
research in the same vein.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.890
So what can explain knowledge resistance?

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:42.490
Well apparently it is
not stupidity, ignorance,

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:44.180
or hatred of science.

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.223
So what is it?

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:49.080
Well to summarize an
awful lot of literature

00:18:49.956 --> 00:18:52.700
and the psychology of belief area,

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.270
there are a lot of concepts which overlap

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.040
quite a bit to cultural cognition,

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.810
motivated cognition,
confirmation bias, et cetera.

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:04.180
For my purposes today,
all of these concepts

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:08.060
refer in some way to
viewing factual information

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.690
through a filter.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:13.470
And the filter is a values and ideology

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:15.870
or a group identification filter.

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.333
Some or all of the above.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:22.400
We social primates share
values and ideology

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.810
with members of our group.

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:25.540
It's part of the way we identify

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:26.830
as members of a group.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:29.036
It's part of the way that groups

00:19:29.036 --> 00:19:32.530
inculturate the younger
members of the group,

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:35.880
values and ideology are
extremely important.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:40.880
And some things about which we are wrong

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:44.180
we can change our mind
about fairly easily.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.330
Things about which we are wrong

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:50.010
which impinge upon our
ideology, our values,

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:54.154
or our group identification
are very resistant to change

00:19:54.154 --> 00:19:57.920
in the form of a variety
of these concepts.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.700
And let me talk a little bit about that

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:04.740
'cause I find it a very
interesting problem.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.120
Before I do though let me do something

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.980
that might seem rather odd.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.853
I'm gonna put in a good
word for ideology, okay?

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.470
In the cartoon science is obviously

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.810
banning ideology from the laboratory.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:21.960
Science is good, that means
ideology has to be bad.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.370
And I don't think about ideology as bad.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.680
When I talk about people having ideologies

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.730
or knowledge resistance
as a function of ideology.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:35.510
I'm not dissing them because they are

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:37.230
expressing ideological views.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.750
I look at ideology, the word ideology

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:44.143
the same way that I look at
the word operation, okay?

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:50.460
An appendectomy and a lobotomy
are both operations, okay?

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:51.433
I've had one.

00:20:52.783 --> 00:20:55.020
(crowd laughs)

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.070
I think I'll just let that float,

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.970
let you draw your own conclusions.

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:02.340
But everything is context.

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.930
There's a difference in context between

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:06.910
an appendectomy and a lobotomy, obviously,

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:09.520
but they're both operations, right?

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.160
Similarly with ideologies,

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.820
there are ideologies that are
destructive and injurious.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:18.123
There are ideologies that are
beneficial and fulfilling.

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:21.450
Ideologies affect how we shape our lives,

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.740
and every single person in this room

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:27.520
is a whole matrix or bundle of ideologies.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.040
One can be a feminist,
humanist, environmentalist.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.880
I know somebody like that.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:38.190
Feminism, humanism, and
environmentalism are isms,

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:39.800
they are ideologies.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:44.270
If you embrace the ideology of feminism

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:45.760
then you hold certain views

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.900
about the relationships
of males and females,

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.590
the equality of males and females

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:52.890
in different areas, et cetera, et cetera.

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:56.690
Ideologies shape how we run our lives,

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:58.130
and they are extremely important.

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:00.980
And they are not necessarily negative.

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.800
Context is everything.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.700
But again we social
primates live in groups

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.310
and our ideologies help

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:09.690
make us part of a group, our values.

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:13.280
It's a very human thing
to have ideologies.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.680
Now where problems arise is where

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:21.680
an ideological position prevents us

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:26.530
from looking dispassionately if you will

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:30.470
at empirical evidence, facts, and logic.

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:34.600
It's a very difficult thing
for we human beings to do

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.210
to set aside our values and our ideology

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:40.240
to look carefully at evidence that may

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:44.310
cause problems for those
ideologies and values.

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.180
It's a very human thing,
it's a very difficult thing.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:48.567
Nobody does it all the time

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:51.040
and hardly anybody does it really well.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.620
So let's take a look
at ideologies, values,

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:55.160
and identifications and how they

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.633
can affect knowledge resistance.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.210
Working with some ideas
from the anthropologist

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:03.590
Mary Douglas, Dan Kahan and his colleagues

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:06.320
suggested that people can be placed along

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.230
two axes depending on their values.

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:12.150
There's an individualist
communitarian axis,

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:16.530
and a cross cutting
hierarchist egalitarian axis.

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:18.860
Now everybody has tendencies
on one or the other

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:20.450
and you can go to the internet

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:22.820
and you can find a quiz that'll put you

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.383
in one of these quadrants.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:28.020
And so everybody has
some tendencies of these

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.920
but people would be placed differently.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.440
Republicans are more likely

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.480
to be hierarchical and individualistic.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.240
Democrats are more likely to be

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.140
egalitarian and communitarian.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:43.090
Libetarians are
egalitarian individualists,

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:46.040
and I didn't know that their
symbol was a porcupine either.

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:50.250
We really don't have a political position

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:53.700
that occupies that
northeast quadrant there.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.600
But in my opinion Evangelical Christians

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.180
are hierarchical communitarians

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.900
which obviously is not parallel

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.330
to the political groups that I am

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:04.450
using as my other examples.

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:07.390
Now these axes are
associated with differing

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:09.763
opinions about social issues.

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:12.490
Hierarchical individualists

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:14.770
don't worry very much
about climate change,

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:16.230
nanotechnology, or guns.

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:18.630
They are agreeing in this diagram

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:20.810
but they are very concerned
about gun control.

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:22.950
That's a red item for them.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:25.240
Egalitarian communitarians worry a lot

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.430
about climate change, nanotech, and guns

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:29.853
but they're rather
positive about gun control.

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:32.350
And differences occur between

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:34.790
the other two diagonals as well.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:38.530
And individualist egalitarian
in the lower left there

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:40.860
who feel strongly about involuntary

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.140
mental health treatment is gonna be

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:46.150
resistant to information
that promotes that practice.

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:48.550
Such information is gonna threaten you

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:50.200
if you have libertarian values

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.630
or potentially cause a rift
with other libertarians,

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:54.650
with your tribe.

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:57.490
So a lot of information is going to be

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:02.000
ignored or discounted if a position

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.120
placed on any of these red issues,

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.323
shall we say is presented.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.610
Kahan and colleagues surveyed people about

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:13.160
how much risk they associate
with global warming

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.540
which is the green line on this diagram,

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:17.940
how much risk they
associate with gun ownership

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.210
which is the red line,

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:21.590
marijuana legalization, the blue line,

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:23.990
and vaccination which is the black line.

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.390
And they found very strong correlations

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:28.410
with political affiliation.

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:30.010
Liberals were very concerned

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:31.860
about global warming and gun ownership,

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:32.940
the green and the red lines,

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:34.550
they're high on that chart.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:36.960
They weren't really fussy at all about

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.520
marijuana legalization.

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.540
And conservative strong Republicans

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.000
were precisely the opposite.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.210
Interestingly enough
childhood vaccinations

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:50.020
didn't show any kind
of political division.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.230
I think this is partly because

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:54.940
contrary to a lot of the panic

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:58.890
that we sometimes feel about
the anti-vaccination movement,

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:00.680
it's actually a very tiny percentage

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.410
of Americans who don't
vaccinate their kids.

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.010
Americans vaccinate their kids

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:08.270
at the rate of like 94, 95, 96%.

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:09.550
It's a very high percentage.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:10.890
So maybe there just wasn't enough

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:13.430
variance on the data to really show up

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:15.823
in terms of political orientation.

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:18.590
So given that people hold values

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:19.860
related to an issue,

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.430
can you change opinions
with more information?

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:26.443
How does the knowledge
deficits argument stand up?

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:30.080
Well, the literature on this topic

00:26:31.394 --> 00:26:34.770
provides some rather
contradictory conclusions.

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:36.430
And by the way don't think Dan Kahan

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:37.810
is the only one doing any research

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:39.290
on this topic 'cause he's not.

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:41.500
It's just that his examples
are usually pretty good

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.300
and I like his graphic.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.080
So for a public lecture
I tend to lean more

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:46.913
on his examples.

00:26:46.913 --> 00:26:47.960
But there are plenty of people

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.730
in addition to Dan doing this work.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:52.820
But this study is really
one of my favorites,

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.460
and let me share it with you.

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:58.860
Now Kahan and his colleagues
tested this sample.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.600
Again these are adult
Americans and their numeracy.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.390
And he found that there was a range,

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:05.677
some people were really good at numbers

00:27:05.677 --> 00:27:08.410
and some people were really,
really terrible at numbers,

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:10.520
low to high numeracy abilities.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.140
They also collected information
on political leanings.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.613
And then they gave them
a little puzzle to solve.

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:18.810
Subjects were asked to evaluate

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:21.320
a study of the efficacy of skin cream

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.840
for treating rashes.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.490
They gave 'em a two by two table.

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:29.060
Some people got the
skin cream, some didn't.

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.960
In some cases the skin
cream helped with the rash,

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.320
in some cases it didn't.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.520
So standard two by two type of thing.

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:39.150
And then they asked them to evaluate.

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:41.000
Does the skin cream work?

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.730
So it's a pretty simple,

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:45.073
can you understand scientific data?

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:47.640
And for part of the sample

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.430
the correct answer was
that the rash got worse.

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:54.072
For another part of the
sample, the rash got better.

00:27:54.072 --> 00:27:57.560
So basically they kept the
numbers in the cells the same.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.413
So the numeracy is kind of
controlled for as it were.

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.300
But in some cases the rash got better,

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.740
then some cases the rash got worse.

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:07.190
They basically just switched
the column headings.

00:28:08.377 --> 00:28:11.660
And that was fine.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.420
And then they changed it up a bit

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.350
and asked a question
about whether gun control

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:18.970
has a positive or a
negative effect on crime.

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:20.960
In other words if you
ban concealed weapons,

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.190
does this increase or decrease crime?

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:26.130
And again as with the hand cream example,

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:27.480
they jiggered the column headings

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:32.480
so that in some cases gun
control reduced crime,

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:36.290
in some cases gun control increased crime.

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:39.650
And in general what they found is that

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:42.380
most everybody stank.

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.920
Either for the rash or the crime example.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.730
Nobody was really very good at this.

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:48.480
It was really only when you got into

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.610
the higher levels of
numeracy on the X axis there,

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:54.130
the ones farthest to the right.

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:55.640
Only the people who got like eight,

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.020
seven, eight, nine in
their numeracy scores,

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.230
those were the only ones
who kind of did well

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:05.230
on either the rash example
or the gun control example.

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:07.477
But then they took a little bit,

00:29:07.477 --> 00:29:10.000
then they took a closer look so to speak

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.090
and factored in political identification.

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:16.670
The figure you're looking at now

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:18.580
is the skin cream example,

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:21.170
and recall that rash
increases or decreases

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:24.380
are both correct answers
depending on the column headings.

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:27.550
And here the results are separated

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:29.060
by party affiliation with blue

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.400
being Democrat and red being Republican.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:36.240
And in general it was kind of like

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.000
the general population results.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.640
The red and the blue
lines are pretty similar.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.330
Nobody did terribly well.

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:44.360
But whether you're a
democrat or republican

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.100
you kind of do well or poorly

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:51.360
on the skin cream example.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.790
But things were very different when they

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:54.240
asked them about gun control.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:58.400
Democrats largely believed that

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.860
crime decreases when guns are restricted.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.800
And when that's the the correct answer

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.720
they're more likely to get it right.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.860
And when crime increases
is the right answer

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.240
they're more likely to get it wrong

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.450
because it fits with their ideology.

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:15.740
Similarly Republicans are more likely

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:18.000
to get it correct that crime increases

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.290
when you restrict guns,

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:21.320
and less likely to get it correct

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.860
when the right answer is crime decreases

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:26.363
which is ideologically less attractive.

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:30.260
And notice that having greater numeracy

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.850
doesn't make you more
likely to get it right

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:36.683
if the correct answer doesn't
fit with your ideology.

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:41.750
Another way of looking at
the knowledge deficit model

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:46.643
and ideology is to provide
incorrect information,

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:50.410
correct the incorrect information

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:52.920
and then see if people change their mind.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.930
And there have been a
number of studies on this.

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:58.030
Nyhan and Riefler's is
a very good example.

00:30:58.030 --> 00:30:59.830
Nyhan and Riefler studies all show

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:01.540
around about the same thing

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:03.780
that when people with strong opinions

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.460
are presented with articles that correct

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:07.960
the misinformation,

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.420
they don't always change their view.

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:11.980
Sometimes they double down
on their original position.

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:14.053
This is called the backfire effect.

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:18.500
And an example of this in this study

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:22.030
the respondents were
given a fake news article

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:25.660
in which President George W Bush

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:28.870
claimed that Iraq had
weapons of mass destruction.

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:30.110
Then they were given an article

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:32.650
that corrected that misinformation,

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:35.110
and then they were asked again

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:38.343
do you think Iraq had
weapons of mass destruction?

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:40.830
People who had reported themselves

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:43.700
as strongly conservative were even

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:47.110
more likely to believe that Iraq had WMDs

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:49.320
after reading the correction.

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:54.300
In another study they quoted
Pres. Bush as claiming

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.920
that tax cuts improved government revenue,

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.600
gave a correction from a Republican

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:00.930
economic source by the way

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:03.090
that no tax cuts don't improve revenue,

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:04.990
and then asked people whether they agreed.

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:07.110
Again the most strongly conservative

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:10.263
were the ones who double
down the backfire effect.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.140
Now the backfire effect
doesn't always happen.

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.270
Not everybody doubles down.

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:20.320
Mostly it occurs among people
who are most polarized.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.493
In another study by Nyhan and Riefler

00:32:22.493 --> 00:32:27.493
they were looking at anti
and pro vaccination groups,

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:30.940
and they surveyed a group of people

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:32.020
and were able to divide them

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.883
into pro and anti vaccination.

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.760
They gave them an
article debunking whether

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:41.870
the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:43.515
produces autism in children.

00:32:43.515 --> 00:32:46.710
And overall by and large the autism

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:48.790
correction story did decrease

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:51.640
the number of people who believe that

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:55.640
MMR vaccine causes autism,

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.820
but it did not work for
that subset of parents

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:01.530
who describe themselves with the strongest

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:04.160
anti-vaccination views.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.090
They double down.

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:07.813
That's where the backfire effect happened.

00:33:07.813 --> 00:33:11.240
The investigators think
that it might have been

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.840
related to a conspiracist kind of ideology

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.683
that accompanied their
strong anti-vax views.

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.850
But the backfire effect was studied

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:23.310
in a series of tests on a very large

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:26.320
group of people like over 10,000 subjects

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:29.050
by Woods and Porter in 2016.

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:31.280
They collected information on people's

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.930
political orientation,

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:35.280
provided them with incorrect information,

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.660
corrected the information,

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:37.970
and then tested them to see

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:41.260
if they accepted the
correction, et cetera,

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:43.750
same sort of model as Nyhan and Riefler.

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:46.693
They found no backfire effect whatsoever.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.050
For example they took statements

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:52.330
from Clinton and Obama that were not true.

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:55.360
Asked liberals, moderates,
and conservatives

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.975
how much they agreed with them.

00:33:56.975 --> 00:33:59.459
Liberals are on the left of the charge,

00:33:59.459 --> 00:34:01.570
conservatives are on the
right, that's the blue,

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:02.570
and the red circles there.

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:04.653
And take a look at that upper row.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:08.780
In the first cell Obama
claimed that gender

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:12.170
wage gap was caused
entirely by discrimination.

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:14.500
Predictably, liberals agreed more

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.580
with this statement
than conservatives did,

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:18.820
and moderates were in the middle.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.170
That's why the line runs as you see it,

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:23.173
with liberals having the higher scores.

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:29.070
Then when they corrected
this misinformation,

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:32.150
indeed the corrected line shows that

00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:35.000
fewer people accepted that as correct.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.303
But the shape of the line was the same.

00:34:37.303 --> 00:34:40.621
More liberals still thought
that Obama was right.

00:34:40.621 --> 00:34:44.110
Liberals were more resistant
to accepting the correction

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:45.680
than conservatives were.

00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:48.800
And the same was true
for the other questions.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.110
There was no backfire effect.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:54.170
Similarly with the conservatives,

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:57.360
Sen. Rubio had claimed
that defense spending

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:01.400
was lower under Obama than
Bush which was not true.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.370
Again conservatives were
more likely to believe that.

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:07.330
To the slant of the line
shows higher proportion

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:09.310
of conservatives accepting that statement.

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:10.820
When they corrected this statement

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:13.090
in general fewer people accepted it

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:14.650
whether liberal or conservative,

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:16.700
and you notice that the line is lower,

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.160
but the shape is still the same.

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.950
So there's still something going on,

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:22.770
but there's no real no backfire effect.

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:26.620
So the backfire effect is curious.

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:28.400
There are lots of studies like these

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.570
showing that values, ideology,

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:34.310
and group identification tend
to trump empirical evidence.

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:36.547
My personal experience
dealing with creationism

00:35:36.547 --> 00:35:40.120
and climate change
underscores these conclusions.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:42.340
Identification as a conservative Christian

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.770
and the ideology of biblical literalism

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:47.830
are major barriers to the
acceptance of evolution

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:49.660
among conservative Christians.

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:53.550
Similarly the values of
personal responsibility,

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:56.810
small government, the
importance of capitalism,

00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:59.200
and at least recently identification

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.750
as a Republican are prime inhibitors

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:03.530
of the acceptance of anthropogenic

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:05.983
climate change for
political conservatives.

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:09.370
Now I wanna go into a little bit more

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:10.870
because a lot of times

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:14.380
when I talk to people
about oh I didn't see a C.

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:16.340
We look at both evolution
and climate change.

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:19.100
People say I wish those people would stop.

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.470
Well, actually it's not the same people.

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:22.850
So let me show you why.

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:25.150
First let's clear up some confusion about

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:27.890
political and religious conservatism.

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:32.390
Conservative Christians hold
certain religious views.

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:33.477
The inerrancy of the bible

00:36:33.477 --> 00:36:35.610
and a personal relationship with Jesus

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:37.640
are the most important.

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:40.620
They are called Evangelicals,
fundamentalist, charismatics.

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:41.930
There's many other terms.

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:44.060
They call themselves
conservative Christians,

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:46.220
so that's the term that I use.

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:49.360
Political conservatives express

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:52.330
confidence in capitalism
as an economic system.

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:54.870
They are opposed to taxation.

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:57.480
They believe in minimal government,

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.150
individual and personal liberty

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:01.290
are elevated to a very high state.

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:04.280
And this is combined
with the American view

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:08.360
that everyone can succeed
based upon their own efforts.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:12.610
The intersection of
conservative Christianity

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:15.170
and political conservatism is referred

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:17.520
to as the religious right.

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:21.780
Now not all religiously
conservative Christians

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:23.900
are political conservatives.

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:27.050
Social gospel Christians
are in the forefront

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:31.000
of many movements in worker rights

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.210
taking care of the poor and disadvantaged.

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:37.930
Similarly not all political conservatives

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:40.010
are religiously conservatives

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:43.320
They don't belong to denominations

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.680
that are biblically literalist,

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:49.210
or they just may not be
especially interested in religion.

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:51.290
Now this diagram is relevant to

00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:54.380
both of the controversies
I'm talking today.

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:58.150
When we overlay anti-evolutionism
on this diagram,

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:02.800
it's clear that the religious
right is steadfastly

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:05.020
anti-evolutionary, yup we know that.

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:08.990
And most of the anti-evolutionists

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:11.223
are religiously conservative.

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:18.090
When a political conservative
is anti-evolutionist,

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.380
it's because he's simultaneously

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:23.290
a religious conservative.

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:25.080
Religious conservatism is what's

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:27.830
really driving anti-evolutionism,

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:29.680
not political conservatism.

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:32.360
If you know somebody is
an anti-evolutionist,

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.540
you've got a pretty good predictor

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:37.030
that that person is
conservative Christian.

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:40.000
It is a much worse, it's
much weaker prediction

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.903
that that person is politically
conservative as well.

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:47.890
Similarly if we overlay
anti-climate change,

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:49.870
climate change contrarianism,

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:51.670
if I say anti-climate change

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:53.420
that's fairly confusing 'cause we're all

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:54.420
anti-climate change.

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:56.590
But you understand that I'm talking about

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:59.780
people who reject the scientific consensus

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.610
on climate change, but that
takes so much longer to say.

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:07.000
So listen to what I mean,
not what I say, okay?

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.193
You all have children,
you know how that works.

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:12.640
But with climate change the main engine

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:16.970
is political conservatism
not religious conservatism.

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:18.610
As a matter of fact there's a substantial

00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:20.360
group of green Christians

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:23.420
who are major, major tree huggers.

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:27.190
They favor creation care, religion,

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:30.150
theological views, stewardship theology

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:31.680
rather than dominion theology.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:36.080
And they are outside of the
anti-climate change movement.

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:38.470
Similarly there has been a long

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:40.040
tradition of environmentalism

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.570
within mainstream Republicanism,

00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:44.610
and not all political conservatives

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:46.610
are anti-climate change.

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:50.149
So idealogically climate
change contrarians

00:39:50.149 --> 00:39:52.410
are politically conservative

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:55.250
rather than religiously
conservative per se.

00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:57.670
If you know somebody
is anti-climate change,

00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:58.750
that's a pretty good marker

00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:00.910
that that person is
politically conservative.

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:03.360
It's a less good marker that that person

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.073
is religiously conservative.

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.180
Now there's nothing quite so satisfying

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.920
for any of us in the sciences

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.760
than discovering that there's actually

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:17.803
scientific validation to your prejudices.

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:22.100
And my colleague Josh Rosenau

00:40:24.278 --> 00:40:27.670
was very kindly given data
from the Pew organization

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:29.810
and he ran some of his own analyses

00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:31.840
looking at what other predictors

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:34.960
of acceptance or rejection
of human evolution,

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.817
acceptance or rejection of global warming.

00:40:36.817 --> 00:40:38.820
Now this is a terrible looking diagram

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:40.450
and it just looks like a pile of spaghetti

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:41.830
but it's not that bad.

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:44.120
Let me just show you how it's actually

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:46.410
a pretty informative kind of thing.

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:50.890
Now the red lines are
negative associations,

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:52.970
negative correlations.

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:56.290
The black lines are positive associations.

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:59.340
And the size of the coefficient there

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:02.630
is a reflection of how
strong that relationship is.

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:05.838
The dotted lines are really
weak associations clearly,

00:41:05.838 --> 00:41:09.720
the thicker the line the
stronger the association.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:14.410
So education is a fairly strong,

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:16.970
is fairly strongly associated positively

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:19.170
with acceptance of human evolution.

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:21.110
In other words the more educated you are,

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:24.230
the more likely you are
to accept evolution.

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:27.480
Interestingly enough it's not associated

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:30.793
with global warming,
acceptance of global warming.

00:41:32.769 --> 00:41:34.600
The more educated you are,

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.170
that doesn't mean you're more likely

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:37.943
to accept global warming.

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:42.300
The strongest negative
association with evolution

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.160
is Born Again theology.

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:45.420
In other words if you're a Born Again

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:47.760
you're less likely to accept evolution.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.620
And church attendance is also

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.940
a very strong negative correlation.

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:53.870
The more you frequently attend church

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:57.690
the less likely you are to
accept human evolution as well.

00:41:57.690 --> 00:41:59.840
And of course there's a
very strong correlation

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.120
between Born Again theology
and church attendance

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.990
as one would expect.

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:06.740
Now there's a fairly
strong negative association

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:10.210
between Born Again theology
and political ideology

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:13.560
by which in the nature of the analysis

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.550
that he was able to use,

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:18.880
this native, and it's
not a value judgment.

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.100
Negative refers to Republicanism.

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:24.450
So the Born Again theology

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:27.200
is associated more with
being a Republican,

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.730
that is why it's a negative.

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:30.690
But it's a fairly strong
correlation there.

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:35.390
And the strongest predictor
of anti-global warming

00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:37.340
is political ideology.

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:40.410
In other words if you are a Democrat,

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:44.023
you're more likely to
accept global warming.

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:47.260
Interestingly enough global warming

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:49.503
and human evolution are not correlated.

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:52.850
So acceptance of
evolution doesn't tell you

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:55.530
very much about acceptance
of global warming

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:57.880
and vice versa which is exactly

00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.100
what my impressions were.

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:01.573
It's so nice to have it
validated like I said.

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:05.090
So politics is an important predictor

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:06.610
of the rejection of global warming,

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:09.540
but not necessarily of the
rejection of evolution.

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:11.230
Religion is a strong predictor

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:13.400
of rejection of human evolution,

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.010
but it's not a strong
predictor of rejection

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:17.063
of global warming.

00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:20.270
So here we are again.

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:22.700
Information alone, just
correcting people's

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:25.260
misunderstandings, just
having more knowledge

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:28.080
is necessary but not
sufficient to change minds.

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:30.940
Values, ideology, and identification

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:32.770
are important factors in determining

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:34.700
whether someone changes their mind

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:38.100
about a scientific issue
or really any other issue.

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:40.910
If changing one mind will cause a conflict

00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:44.310
with values, ideology, or identification,

00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:48.210
empirical factual evidence is
going to have an uphill climb.

00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:51.830
In the case of evolution,
of anti-evolutionists,

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:54.380
for a conservative Christian,

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:56.850
they believe that the bible

00:43:56.850 --> 00:43:59.830
is absolutely true from
Genesis to Revelations

00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:01.660
and that you cannot pick and choose.

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:03.780
So if everything in Genesis is not

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:07.730
absolutely literally true, how
can they believe Revelations?

00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:09.830
How can they know that there will be

00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:12.070
a reunion with God at
the end times, et cetera,

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:15.363
that they'll be reunited with
their loved ones, et cetera.

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:19.110
If evolution is true all
that goes out the window

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:20.500
which is what they believe.

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:23.430
That is only one Christian
position obviously,

00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:26.170
but it's one that's felt
very, very seriously.

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:30.033
So clearly if evolution is
right they're gonna lose big.

00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:33.620
So you can see that there's a very strong

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:36.290
motivation for evolution not to be correct

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:39.570
no matter how much you
shovel science on top of it.

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:41.530
No matter how cogent your explanation

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:42.980
of the Cambrian Explosion,

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.750
if they're gonna use salvation

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:47.120
they're not likely to believe you, right?

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:49.850
And it's the same thing
with different examples

00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:51.060
with global warming.

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:54.500
But lest, I'm just really
a very cheerful person

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:57.250
who talks about these
depressing things all the time.

00:44:57.250 --> 00:44:59.553
But I don't want to leave you depressed.

00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:02.930
People do change their minds.

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:06.420
Even when issues relates to these

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:09.470
very important issues of values,

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:12.053
ideology, and group identification.

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:17.140
Bob Inglis, former South
Carolina Republican

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:19.350
Congressional Representative to Congress

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:22.020
was very dismissive of climate change.

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:23.557
Like other Republicans he thought

00:45:23.557 --> 00:45:24.970
"An Inconvenient Truth"

00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:26.740
was just garbage and it was nothing

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:28.670
but a Democratic plot to seize

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:31.190
more central government power.

00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:34.960
This is clearly just liberal nonsense.

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:36.490
In the movie "Merchants of Doubt",

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:38.330
which I encourage anybody to see

00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:39.670
if they haven't seen it already

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:42.210
or read the book and see the movie,

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:44.050
he relates how he accompanied

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:48.150
a group of scientists and
other politicians to Antarctica

00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:53.150
where he was blown away
by the ice core evidence

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:56.180
by looking at the melting glaciers,

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:58.767
the before and after
photographs and so forth.

00:45:58.767 --> 00:46:01.470
It was just a stunning experience

00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:05.720
for him to actually see the
evidence of climate change.

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:07.840
He also reported in interviews

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:11.320
that his family also pushed
him to accept climate change.

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:12.500
Quote.

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.610
My oldest was voting for the first time

00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:16.250
when I ran again in 2004.

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:18.477
And he said, "Dad, I'll vote for you.

00:46:18.477 --> 00:46:20.277
"But you're gonna have
to clean up your act

00:46:20.277 --> 00:46:21.627
"on the environment."

00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:24.470
And so I have this new constituency.

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:26.310
My son, my four daughters, my wife,

00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:28.500
all feeling the same way.

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:31.380
By the way unfortunately Bob Inglis

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:33.760
was primaried in 2012 and lost his seat,

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.230
but there you go.

00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:37.750
Michael Schermer, president
of the Skeptic society,

00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:39.280
editor of the Skeptic magazine,

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.800
also claims a turnaround in his opinion

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.280
about climate change.

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:45.460
In a column he wrote
for Scientific America

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:47.330
he writes that he rejected global warming

00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:49.760
'cause basically he's
got burr under a saddle

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:50.945
about environmentalism.

00:46:50.945 --> 00:46:52.730
He's never liked environmentalists.

00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:55.580
So it is just another bunch
of crazy environmentalist,

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:56.900
so he was rejecting that.

00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:01.270
He writes in another essay in 2008.

00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:04.210
Later that month I
attended a TED conference

00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:06.100
where former Vice President Al Gore

00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:08.190
delivered the single finest summation

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:09.570
of the evidence for global warming

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:13.200
I had ever heard based on
"An Inconvenient Truth".

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.590
Because we are primates with such visually

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:17.470
dominant sensory systems,

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:19.940
we need to see the evidence to believe it.

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:22.840
And the striking visuals
of countless graphs

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:26.040
and charts and especially the
before and after photographs

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.020
showing the disappearance of glaciers

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:31.360
around the world shocked me viscerally

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:33.603
and knocked me out of my skepticism.

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:38.080
Richard Cizik is the former

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.050
Vice President of Governmental Affairs

00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:42.554
for the National
Association of Evangelicals.

00:47:42.554 --> 00:47:46.910
He's a pro-Bush conservative
by his own words.

00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:49.980
In an interview in 2005 he said, quote,

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:52.550
I had a conversion experience
on the climate issue

00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:55.600
not unlike my conversion to Christ.

00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.710
I was at a conference in Oxford

00:47:57.710 --> 00:48:01.200
where Sir John Hutton,
an Evangelical scientist,

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:04.140
was presenting evidence
of shrinking ice caps.

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:07.250
Temperatures tracked for
millennia through ice core data,

00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:11.490
increasing hurricane intensity,
drought patterns and so on,

00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:15.110
I realized all at once with sudden awe

00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:16.970
that climate change is a phenomenon

00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:18.523
of truly biblical proportions.

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:23.620
All three of these
individuals changed his mind

00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:27.150
saying that the facts,
empirical evidence in science

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:29.920
made them finally accept climate change.

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.050
Yet if you remember the stories

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:34.530
of how this change came about,

00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:37.510
each of them experienced some emotional

00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:40.830
concomitant of this change in view.

00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:42.850
Inglis was under pressure from his family

00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:44.680
to be more environmentally friendly,

00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:46.410
plus he describes being emotionally

00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:49.220
blown away by his Antarctica experience.

00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:51.660
Shermer talks about
being viscerally shocked

00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:54.150
by a presentation on climate change.

00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:56.680
And I suspect he also
had a tribal conflict

00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:59.560
because his science tribe
was pulling in one direction,

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:02.790
his libertarian tribe was
pulling him in another direction,

00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:05.170
and he felt this conflict as well.

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:06.740
That's my own hypothesis.

00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:09.740
Cizik talks about the awe he felt

00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:13.010
in realizing the seriousness
of global warming,

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:15.550
and the consequences of which appealed

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:18.520
to his theological and ideological values.

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.940
Each of these men indeed became aware

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:22.930
of scientific evidence for global warming,

00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:25.750
but each of them also had a profound

00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:29.700
emotional experience
as part of this change.

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:33.570
We human beings are not
just logical and rational.

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:37.110
We are creatures with emotions and beliefs

00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:39.330
that are critical in shaping us

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:41.423
as the human beings that we are.

00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:43.630
What about creationists?

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:45.900
Do they ever change their minds?

00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:48.290
Well, first, consider
that within Christianity

00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:52.150
there are a lot of different
views about evolution,

00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:55.010
from the most strict, Flat-Earthers,

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:57.260
through Geocentrists, to Young-Earthers,

00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:00.430
to Old-Earthers, to
theistic evolutionists,

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:04.290
the farther down the creation
evolution continuum you go,

00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:06.730
the more science is accepted.

00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:08.220
Now of course the best kept secret

00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:10.750
in this whole controversy
is that Catholics

00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:13.300
and mainstream protestants
accept evolution

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:15.030
as the way God did it.

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:19.320
This is not a problem for the
vast majority of American,

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:22.710
of Christians internationally especially.

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:25.450
Now very few Christians are Flat-Earthers

00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:26.600
or Geocentrists.

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:29.440
So the bulk of the anti-evolution movement

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:31.380
comes from Young-Earth creationists

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:33.150
and Old-Earth creationists.

00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:35.200
It is among these conservative Christians

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.880
that you'll find the problems.

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:40.250
Liberal Christians look
at science differently.

00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:44.090
I love this episcopal ad from the 1970s

00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:48.610
which illustrates how liberal
Christians look at science.

00:50:48.610 --> 00:50:51.460
To these Christians religion
is about other things

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:53.503
than explaining the natural world.

00:50:54.610 --> 00:50:56.320
But even conservative Christians

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:58.450
are not universally against evolution.

00:50:58.450 --> 00:51:00.380
The two best known Evangelical

00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:02.100
institutions promoting science

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:04.150
are the American Scientific Affiliation

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:06.488
and BioLogus Foundation.

00:51:06.488 --> 00:51:09.220
ASA has been around since the 1940s.

00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:11.220
In order to be a member of ASA,

00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:13.250
you have to be an Evangelical Christian,

00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:17.250
and you also have to have a
graduate degree in science.

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:20.590
BioLogus Foundation was
launched more recently in 2009.

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:23.850
It's an online source originally founded

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:25.530
by Francis Collins, the head

00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:27.260
of the National Institute of Health

00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:29.880
and a group of his supporters.

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:31.820
There's a fairly large and growing

00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:33.820
literature of Evangelical Christians

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:35.060
reaching out to their fellows

00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:36.600
with the message that one can be

00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:38.980
an Evangelical and a scientist

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:41.810
and also accept evolution.

00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:43.570
Some of these are very famous scientists

00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:46.570
like Francis Collins,
others are not known outside

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:48.840
of the Evangelical community.

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:50.930
Some of the most interesting stories

00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:53.020
are those of Young-Earth creationists

00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:55.633
who have converted, if
you will, to evolution.

00:51:56.490 --> 00:51:58.540
I have read a number of these case studies

00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:01.110
and I know a number of
these people personally,

00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:04.930
and I have summarized some themes

00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:09.643
from this literature which
I think are probably valid.

00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:13.660
The process of abandoning the dichotomous

00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:16.250
creation or evolution view

00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:18.180
resulted in a variety of outcomes

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:19.890
for these scientists from,

00:52:19.890 --> 00:52:23.820
some of them just simply
left Christianity en toto.

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:26.670
Others adopted a more
liberal form of Christianity,

00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:30.050
and some maintain their
Evangelical theology

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:33.870
but dispensed with the
biblical literalism.

00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:35.970
More than one of these scientists

00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:40.100
started studying evolution
with the goal of refuting it.

00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:42.070
This is why they went to graduate school.

00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:43.730
They were gonna learn about evolution

00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:45.310
so that they could fight it.

00:52:45.310 --> 00:52:48.940
And what they found is
that the scientific data

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:51.073
was ultimately persuasive.

00:52:53.530 --> 00:52:56.150
Very many of them
expressed an intellectual

00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:58.620
disdain for their Young-Earth views.

00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:00.850
They were affronted when they discovered

00:53:00.850 --> 00:53:04.050
how shoddy the science of
creation science actually was,

00:53:04.050 --> 00:53:06.680
and also the lack of self-correction

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:08.160
among the Young-Earth creationists,

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.130
and of course self-correction

00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:14.810
is a hallmark of how real science is done.

00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:16.890
For many the acceptance of evolution

00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:19.170
was allowed, if you will,

00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:22.650
because they started studying the bible

00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:24.870
in a seminary or a graduate course,

00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:27.510
and they learned that
the bible had a history.

00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:30.700
They learned that the
bible had an evolution.

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:32.650
It was based on several manuscripts.

00:53:32.650 --> 00:53:34.800
There were many authors of the bible.

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.070
The bible had a history,

00:53:36.070 --> 00:53:38.320
and there were parts of it
that were contradictory.

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:42.180
And the exposure to biblical scholarship

00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:44.620
in combination with, well,

00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:46.350
the exposure to biblical scholarship

00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:50.280
for many of these scientists
resulted in them being able

00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:55.250
to look more dispassionately
at the science of evolution.

00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:57.820
Unfortunately many
found themselves shunned

00:53:57.820 --> 00:53:59.860
or in other ways mistreated by their

00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:03.330
former Evangelical brethren
once they identified as having

00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:05.303
rejected Young-Earth creationists.

00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:08.040
But the overwhelming theme

00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:10.370
in virtually all of
these personal journeys

00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:13.210
was how encountering the strength

00:54:13.210 --> 00:54:15.140
of the data and theory supporting

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:17.210
evolution forced them to eventually

00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:19.870
relent and abandon
their Young-Earth views.

00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:23.593
For these scientists the
science encountered a lot.

00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:27.090
Yet at the same time most of the people

00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:28.550
who have written of their conversions

00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:31.210
to evolution recall an emotional

00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:33.370
or ideological concomitant of the shift,

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:36.400
even those who attribute the change

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:39.380
primarily to the recognition
of the power of science.

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:41.990
Just to take three of the case studies

00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:44.470
that I looked at for this talk,

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:47.130
Denis Lamoureux reports his shock

00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:49.130
at discovering in his PhD studies

00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:50.620
in evolutionary biology that

00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:53.670
his understand of evolution
which had been derived

00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:56.480
from Young-Earth creationist
literature was just wrong,

00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:58.650
just totally, totally wrong.

00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:01.260
There were transitional fossils.

00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:04.460
There was a process and
mechanism of evolution.

00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:06.690
Evolution was not a result of chance

00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:09.180
and randomness and so on and so forth.

00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:11.750
Glenn Morton was similarly shocked when

00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:16.000
he presented evidence from,
he's a petroleum geologist,

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.000
and he presented evidence from geology

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.630
that the world had to be old.

00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:22.510
It could not be young,

00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:25.410
and he was totally shunned and rejected

00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:27.430
by the Young-Earth creationists.

00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:30.070
Emily Willoughby reports
that the painful death

00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:32.500
from cancer her of 19-year-old brother

00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:34.940
whom she loved dearly shook her confidence

00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:36.890
in the truth of Christianity generally.

00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:39.300
And the Young-Earth creationists

00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:41.390
arguments began tomake less sense

00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:43.513
as she studied the actual science.

00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:45.920
Now more accounts of conversions

00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.520
of this sort would be necessary

00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:49.550
in order to test my generalizations

00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:51.410
and see if they can be extended.

00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:53.620
But for our purposes this afternoon,

00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:56.720
do note that these were all,

00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:00.520
the several cases that I
studied were all scientists

00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:03.940
who believed that the power
of evolutionary science,

00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:06.770
the power of geology, the
power of astronomy and physics,

00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:09.760
the power of science changed their

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:12.070
orientation from anti-evolution,

00:56:12.070 --> 00:56:15.490
Young-Earth creationism, to
an acceptance of evolution.

00:56:15.490 --> 00:56:17.550
But remember everyone also had

00:56:17.550 --> 00:56:20.390
some sort of an emotional or values

00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:22.660
related experience along with it.

00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:26.640
It's very difficult to find examples

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:29.910
of somebody for whom just
the science was persuasive.

00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:33.270
There was always an emotional interaction.

00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:37.380
Now not everybody who is
exposed to the science

00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:40.750
has a conversion experience like this.

00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:43.420
Kurt Wise is a well known
Young-Earth creationist.

00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:44.700
He studied at Harvard under

00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:47.540
Stephen Jay Gould many decades ago.

00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:49.943
This is a guy who knows the science, okay?

00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:54.260
Kurt will go to creationist conferences.

00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:58.430
And when a creationist will make a comment

00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:59.840
about the geological column

00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:01.830
or radioisotopic dating or something,

00:57:01.830 --> 00:57:03.410
Kurt will say, no, that's wrong.

00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:04.683
That's not what they say.

00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:06.680
It doesn't make him a lot of fans

00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:09.130
among some of his fellow
Young-Earth creationist,

00:57:09.130 --> 00:57:11.500
but this is a guy who, in my opinion,

00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:13.780
has a lot of integrity when
it comes to the science.

00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:17.380
So this is a guy who
knows the science, right?

00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:19.530
But he has also been quoted as saying

00:57:19.530 --> 00:57:22.300
that if it weren't for
his religious beliefs,

00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:24.440
if he had only the scientific evidence,

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:25.890
he would've accept evolution.

00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:30.410
So clearly, and I don't bring up Kurt Wise

00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:31.510
'cause I wanna be depressing,

00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:34.130
but to remind us that knowledge resistance

00:57:34.130 --> 00:57:37.470
is a complicated subject
with much variation

00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:40.690
in its manifestations from
individual to individual,

00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:42.660
and even among trained scientists

00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:45.010
who are potentially the most inclined

00:57:45.010 --> 00:57:47.013
to respond to scientific data.

00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:50.130
So what do we do about this?

00:57:50.130 --> 00:57:52.100
Well the communications research people

00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:53.770
have suggested that changing minds

00:57:53.770 --> 00:57:56.040
require effective messages.

00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:58.250
And of course what is
effective in one context

00:57:58.250 --> 00:58:00.810
will be different than one
what's effective in another.

00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:04.150
I was doing a radio show up in Canada

00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:06.270
a couple of years ago
and the little community

00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:08.120
where we were broadcasting from

00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:09.980
had an anti-vaccination outbreak

00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:11.210
and everybody was, oh my God,

00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:13.400
people aren't vaccinating their kids.

00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:17.810
So the interviewer was asking me about

00:58:17.810 --> 00:58:19.310
the anti-vaccination movement,

00:58:19.310 --> 00:58:20.850
and we were talking in general

00:58:20.850 --> 00:58:22.580
about the importance of, you know,

00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:26.311
science and vaccinations
work and all of this.

00:58:26.311 --> 00:58:28.440
And she said, yes.

00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:31.370
And it's very important
that a high percentage

00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:33.709
of people in the community get vaccinated

00:58:33.709 --> 00:58:37.430
so that everybody will be, or sorry.

00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:39.010
It's very important that a high percentage

00:58:39.010 --> 00:58:40.030
of people in the community

00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:41.570
get vaccinated because then

00:58:41.570 --> 00:58:43.920
the people who can't get vaccinated

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:45.550
like very young children or people

00:58:45.550 --> 00:58:47.190
who have immune system problems,

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:48.820
they'll be protected as well.

00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:51.270
And I just had to kind
of chuckle and say, okay,

00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:53.080
that's gonna work in Canada maybe.

00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:54.990
You heard immunity is gonna be

00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:56.570
maybe persuasive in Canada,

00:58:56.570 --> 00:58:59.870
but I'm not sure how persuasive
it is in the United States.

00:58:59.870 --> 00:59:02.290
But there's where you have to consider,

00:59:02.290 --> 00:59:04.610
consider the message being effective

00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:07.150
for the audience in which
you're dealing as well.

00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:09.100
An example of very effective messaging

00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:10.780
that some of us will remember

00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:13.230
was the California anti-smoking campaign

00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:16.140
of the 1990s to the early 2000s.

00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:18.190
Simple effective messages.

00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:19.970
Tobacco industry lies.

00:59:19.970 --> 00:59:21.290
Nicotine is addictive.

00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:23.220
Second-hand smoke kills.

00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:26.870
The percentage of Californians
who smoke plummeted

00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:27.903
during that decade.

00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:31.620
Ed Maibach at the George Mason Center

00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:33.210
for Climate Change Communication

00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:35.220
stressed that simplicity
when communicating

00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:36.880
the importance of climate change.

00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.660
Their research show that people who

00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:41.790
believe it's happening,
it's real, it's us,

00:59:41.790 --> 00:59:43.360
it's bad, and it's solvable

00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:45.680
are more likely to take action.

00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:48.680
But again what kind of message
comes out is also important.

00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:51.460
If you're gonna take that
fourth bullet that it's bad,

00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:53.560
well, stress is bad for humans

00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:54.960
because that's more effective

00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:56.900
than saying it's bad for polar bears.

00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:59.793
We're much more concerned
about how things affect us.

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:02.720
Importantly the message has to come

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.560
from a trusted messenger.

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:08.160
And we most trust people
who are like ourselves.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.770
People who are like ourselves speak

01:00:09.770 --> 01:00:11.483
the same language, not literally.

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:15.110
They have the same values.

01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:16.650
They share the same ideologies.

01:00:16.650 --> 01:00:19.380
They're much more likely
to be listened to.

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:22.960
A friend of mine was talking about GMOs

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:26.610
with an anti-GMO person,

01:00:26.610 --> 01:00:28.790
and they were just not getting anywhere.

01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:30.800
They were just totally butting heads.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.967
And finally his opponent said,

01:00:33.967 --> 01:00:36.030
"You libertarians are all alike!"

01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:37.477
And he said, "Libertarian?

01:00:37.477 --> 01:00:38.847
"I'm a socialist."

01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:44.003
He said the tone of the
conversation switched 180 degrees.

01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:48.290
My friend said because I was like him,

01:00:48.290 --> 01:00:49.890
maybe I was saying something

01:00:49.890 --> 01:00:51.240
that should be listened to.

01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:55.470
Evangelical Christians
who accept evolution

01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:57.110
like Denis Lamoureux and Glenn Morton

01:00:57.110 --> 01:00:59.120
and pretty much anybody from BioLogos

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.780
are very important messengers

01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:04.340
to the Evangelical Christian
community about evolution.

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:06.280
Katharine Hayhoe is a climate scientist

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.430
who's also an Evangelical Christian.

01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:10.610
As a fellow Evangelical and a scientist,

01:01:10.610 --> 01:01:12.930
she's in a very unique position

01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:14.300
to be a trusted messenger

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:17.610
to those Evangelicals who
do reject climate change.

01:01:17.610 --> 01:01:20.720
The trusted messenger has
to have the right message.

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.120
And her message to her fellow Evangelicals

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:25.610
stresses the theology
called creation care,

01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:27.680
and also the values expressed

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:30.400
in social gospel theology
which is important

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.973
to many Evangelicals.

01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:35.970
Bob Inglis can be a trusted
messenger to Republicans,

01:01:35.970 --> 01:01:37.580
Michael Shermer to libertarians,

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:42.210
Richard Cizik to Evangelicals.

01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:44.240
Finally communications specialists tell us

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.340
that messages need to be repeated often

01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:48.320
before they are absorbed.

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:51.460
I often would tell my colleagues at NCSE

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:55.840
that you're never gonna change
anybody's mind in one pass.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:58.340
I mean my colleagues would go out,

01:01:58.340 --> 01:01:59.850
they'd give talks at other

01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:03.260
colleges and universities, I'd give.

01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:05.470
We do drive by science, right?

01:02:05.470 --> 01:02:07.420
We're there for an hour and we're gone.

01:02:08.596 --> 01:02:10.210
The best you can hope for is that

01:02:10.210 --> 01:02:11.890
some of the ideas that you put out

01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:14.640
may just crack the door open a little bit

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:17.520
to somebody who opposes your ideas.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:19.750
Maybe the next time they hear that same

01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:22.020
series of idea, the door will be

01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:23.610
cracked open a little wider.

01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:26.220
So you never do it in one pass.

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:29.953
Effective messages from a
trusted messenger repeated often.

01:02:31.110 --> 01:02:33.970
Repetition of course can be good or bad.

01:02:33.970 --> 01:02:36.050
NPR released a poll in 2017

01:02:36.050 --> 01:02:38.850
reporting the 55% of American whites

01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:41.150
believe that whites are
discriminated against.

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:46.750
May I remind you that this survey data

01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:49.470
and the actual empirical evidence

01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:51.700
that we have does not support the idea

01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:53.750
that minorities are getting all the jobs.

01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:57.513
I think this is a message
that is repeated often.

01:02:58.900 --> 01:02:59.863
No collusion.

01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:04.090
So what does resistance tell us?

01:03:04.090 --> 01:03:05.610
Sorry, what does research tell us

01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:07.340
about knowledge resistance?

01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:08.930
Well, it's partly the ideas themselves.

01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:10.420
You can change your mind more easily

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:12.090
about how photosynthesis works

01:03:12.090 --> 01:03:14.020
or that we use 10% of our brain

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:16.240
because those ideas don't challenge

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.590
our ideologies, values or identification

01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:20.060
with our social groups.

01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:21.350
We know people are reluctant

01:03:21.350 --> 01:03:23.560
to change their minds for many reasons,

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:28.030
and it's not stupidity, ignorance,
or rejection of science.

01:03:28.030 --> 01:03:30.620
It's not that people ignore
the science, they like science.

01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:32.993
They just don't like this science.

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:36.960
There is evidence that
information can change minds.

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:39.220
It's not all the backfire effect.

01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:42.200
And we can change our ideas

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:44.040
and opinions even about issues

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:45.920
that are very important to us.

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:48.880
It's just that ideology,
values, and how people

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:52.140
identify with others comes first

01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:55.100
before the science can be listened to.

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:59.610
I would sometimes use
the analogy, metaphor,

01:03:59.610 --> 01:04:01.430
you gotta get the fingers out of the ears

01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:03.900
before they can even hear the science.

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:06.300
So if a conservative Christian believes

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.060
that they're gonna lose salvation

01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:10.250
is evolution is true,
it's gonna be really hard

01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:12.423
to get the fingers out of those ears.

01:04:13.490 --> 01:04:16.360
Finally we need to consider
communication strategies

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:19.570
that have been shown to
work to do a better job.

01:04:19.570 --> 01:04:21.563
Here's my low-tech suggestion.

01:04:22.810 --> 01:04:24.653
People need to talk to one another.

01:04:26.090 --> 01:04:28.400
We need to build up relationships of trust

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:31.770
which requires mutual respect.

01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:33.660
Trusted messengers are listened to.

01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:35.810
The most trusted are
people from the same tribe.

01:04:35.810 --> 01:04:38.130
But even if you're from a different tribe.

01:04:38.130 --> 01:04:40.150
You can build a trustful relationship

01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:42.060
with someone who disagrees with you

01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:43.640
who has different opinions.

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:46.480
I'm a humanist but I have built up

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:48.450
good relationships with Evangelical,

01:04:48.450 --> 01:04:51.270
with many Evangelical
Christians over the years.

01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:53.460
I think I have built a
relationship of trust

01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:55.240
with many Evangelical Christians

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.420
because I treat them with respect,

01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:59.260
I listen to their concerns,

01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:02.680
they treat me with respect,
they listen to my concerns.

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:06.370
And we can find the areas where we agree.

01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:09.420
And if you can find some
areas where you can agree,

01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:12.010
then you can work out the
areas that you disagree

01:05:12.010 --> 01:05:14.130
and then you can move those

01:05:14.130 --> 01:05:15.483
pieces around a little bit.

01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:19.610
If you can establish
trustful relationships,

01:05:19.610 --> 01:05:22.110
then there's a possibility
that you can move forward.

01:05:22.110 --> 01:05:24.110
You can get the fingers out of the ears.

01:05:25.110 --> 01:05:27.230
And I personally believe that

01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:29.200
if you get the fingers out of the ears,

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:31.010
the science has a really good chance

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:33.010
of being listened to because

01:05:33.010 --> 01:05:36.510
the facts and conclusions of
science can be persuasive.

01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:40.300
Once values, ideologies,
and group identification

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:43.180
aren't the most important issues

01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:44.860
keeping the fingers in the ears.

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:47.530
And because these aren't
easy problems to solve,

01:05:47.530 --> 01:05:49.750
let me direct you to the National Center

01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:52.350
for Science Education
for further information.

01:05:52.350 --> 01:05:54.827
Please go to ncse.com and you'll find

01:05:54.827 --> 01:05:57.110
much more information on

01:05:57.110 --> 01:05:59.190
the controversies over teaching evolution

01:05:59.190 --> 01:06:00.500
and climate change,

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:03.380
and some ideas of what you can do to help.

01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:05.680
And again I am just so honored

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.090
to be a Hitchcock lecturer

01:06:07.090 --> 01:06:09.837
and thank you very much
for coming out to hear me.

01:06:09.837 --> 01:06:12.587
(crowd applauds)

01:06:15.450 --> 01:06:18.613
- [Man] It strikes me that
the part of the problem,

01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:22.270
40%, maybe that they think

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:25.470
there's no basis for
morality without religion.

01:06:25.470 --> 01:06:28.150
And I wonder whether in terms of ignorance

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:29.500
what people were ignorant about

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:32.730
is not so much the
general facts of evolution

01:06:32.730 --> 01:06:34.450
but the fact that there is

01:06:34.450 --> 01:06:38.970
an evolutionary explanation
for morality that's valid.

01:06:38.970 --> 01:06:40.900
And that we as a species,

01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:42.880
there's a reason for morality within

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.860
our species for the success of the species

01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:47.150
which also has to do with
global warming by the way,

01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:50.380
how moral you are about
your next generations.

01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:52.690
But I wonder if much effort has been made

01:06:52.690 --> 01:06:54.200
with the Evangelicals.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:56.340
They cling to the religion, so to speak.

01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:58.410
It seems to me because they
think they're gonna lose

01:06:58.410 --> 01:07:01.731
their whole value system
if they don't have it.

01:07:01.731 --> 01:07:04.344
- There are two reasons why

01:07:04.344 --> 01:07:06.870
conservative Christians reject evolution.

01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:09.570
One that I did talk about
is the loss of salvation.

01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:11.430
The second one is the point you make.

01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:14.020
They believe that good behavior,

01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:15.653
ethical and moral behavior,

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:21.820
those directives come from
God, from Jesus, in the bible.

01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:25.550
And if you don't have those directives,

01:07:25.550 --> 01:07:27.990
then you won't be a good,

01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:30.330
our children will grow
up to be wild people.

01:07:30.330 --> 01:07:32.830
And this is a very serious

01:07:32.830 --> 01:07:36.313
and sincere belief that they have.

01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:40.440
I have found when I have spoken

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:42.590
to Evangelical Christians on this issue,

01:07:42.590 --> 01:07:45.690
and I'm a humanist, I'm
not a believer in God,

01:07:45.690 --> 01:07:48.480
and we'll talk a little bit

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:50.323
and I'll say, well,

01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:56.980
there are non-theistic ethical systems,

01:07:57.270 --> 01:07:59.290
and that comes as a real surprise

01:07:59.290 --> 01:08:00.710
'cause they don't know that.

01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:03.773
In this case this could
be a matter of ignorance.

01:08:04.825 --> 01:08:07.560
And this makes them stop

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:09.140
because they've never really thought

01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:10.290
that there could be other

01:08:10.290 --> 01:08:12.820
systems of morality other than those

01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:14.823
that were divinely bestowed.

01:08:14.823 --> 01:08:17.156
- [Man] Scientific evidence.

01:08:18.090 --> 01:08:20.540
- You're point I think also in continuing

01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:25.540
was that there have been suggestions

01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:29.110
from the evolutionary literature
for natural explanations

01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:32.350
for the development of
ethical and moral systems.

01:08:32.350 --> 01:08:36.280
However those explanations tell you

01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:39.520
that we develop ethical and moral systems

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:42.480
as part of social behavior,

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:44.250
group cohesion, et cetera, et cetera.

01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:45.920
It doesn't tell you specifically

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:47.360
that you should marry your cross-cousin

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:49.563
rather than your parallel cousin, okay?

01:08:51.786 --> 01:08:54.820
There still is a lot of room

01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:58.220
for philosophical and traditional

01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:02.320
and religious explanations
for how one should behave

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:05.920
even if evolutionary biology can give us

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:08.710
some suggestions for why
these views are adaptive.

01:09:08.710 --> 01:09:11.280
It still doesn't actually replace

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:13.240
the views that people consider important.

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:14.510
- [Man] But there is
also scientific evidence

01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:16.500
that we're not just intrinsically selfish,

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:19.090
horrible animals that need
something on top of us to--

01:09:19.090 --> 01:09:21.380
- We have to learn everything.

01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:22.750
We need to go on to the next speaker.

01:09:22.750 --> 01:09:24.890
Thank you for your question.

01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:26.750
- [Man] One thing that they talk about is

01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:28.010
trying to change the narrative.

01:09:28.010 --> 01:09:29.530
So what would you recommend

01:09:29.530 --> 01:09:31.970
in trying to replace someone's narrative

01:09:31.970 --> 01:09:34.270
on evolution or whatnot?

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:36.300
What kind of examples would you give

01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:40.040
to someone that they want to start

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:42.410
their discussion about
changing their narratives?

01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:43.800
- You mean if you're dealing with somebody

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.040
who's an anti-evolutionist?

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.220
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:50.690
Well, my recommendation to, like I say,

01:09:50.690 --> 01:09:52.450
talk to each other.

01:09:52.450 --> 01:09:53.903
But mostly listen.

01:09:55.150 --> 01:09:58.060
My first recommendation is if you are

01:09:58.060 --> 01:09:59.660
dealing with somebody whose views

01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:01.460
on scientific issue like evolution

01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:03.250
or climate or whatever are very different

01:10:03.250 --> 01:10:06.290
from yours and we assume that your view

01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:07.920
is actually supported by science,

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.340
although you may have crazy views.

01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:11.413
We'll assume that your views count.

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.550
What you need to do is find

01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:16.600
what that person's views are

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:18.940
and not assume that you
understand what they are.

01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:23.360
And then probe question, listen further,

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:26.470
why does this person hold
the beliefs that they do.

01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:30.190
It may be ignorance in which case

01:10:30.190 --> 01:10:33.220
you might direct them to a trusted source

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:35.360
that would give them that information.

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.930
I send a lot of people to

01:10:36.930 --> 01:10:40.130
the American Scientific
Affiliation website

01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:41.840
'cause these are Evangelical Christians

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:44.360
who will tell you why radiometric dating

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.130
is actually valid.

01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:49.500
And if I tell them
radiometric dating is valid,

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:50.420
they're not gonna believe it

01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:52.180
nearly as much as if a trusted

01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:54.510
messenger delivers that same thing.

01:10:54.510 --> 01:10:56.990
So I think you really have to know

01:10:56.990 --> 01:11:00.240
where the person you're talking to,

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:03.240
where the person you're dealing with

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:05.790
is coming from and why they
hold the views they do.

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:11.750
I have learned some things
about anti-vaccination parents.

01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:15.440
And these parents are
really, really scared

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:18.590
about something bad
happening to their kids.

01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:21.900
And, yeah, you have to
change that narrative.

01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:25.570
You have to assuage those concerns

01:11:25.570 --> 01:11:28.130
but find out, listen more carefully

01:11:28.130 --> 01:11:31.680
and find out why this
person feels this way.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:32.920
It may be anecdotal.

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:37.520
It may be because their
cousin's brother-in-law's niece

01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:41.810
had a child who got autism two weeks

01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:43.080
after getting a shot.

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.320
And so that is really dramatic.

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:47.280
There are ways of dealing
with stuff like that.

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:50.420
But you need to listen a lot.

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:51.500
And you need to think about

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:54.120
what people say and
treat them respectfully.

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.963
Anyway, thank you for your question.

01:11:58.990 --> 01:12:00.687
- [Man] Thank you for everything.

01:12:00.687 --> 01:12:05.130
You mentioned assuaging the fears,

01:12:05.130 --> 01:12:09.240
and you mentioned not depressing us.

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:13.810
Have you studied the science
of anxiety and depression?

01:12:13.810 --> 01:12:16.680
And in particular the science

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:19.220
of cognitive behavior therapy

01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:24.140
basically is the science of humans

01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:29.140
exaggerating threats and
exaggerating their confidence.

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:36.740
- I believe I understand the field

01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:39.480
that you're discussing, and
it's a very important field.

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:42.240
It is, however, a little bit past

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.030
the pay scale so to speak

01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:47.510
of what NCSE does and what I have done.

01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:52.510
I think that is a much
more clinical approach.

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.060
I think that the people,

01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:57.060
the level upon which I am dealing this

01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:59.610
I don't think is quite
relevant to your point.

01:12:59.610 --> 01:13:01.360
But it is an important field.

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:04.170
It definitely is, so thank you.

01:13:04.170 --> 01:13:06.110
- [Man] I have a somewhat
different perspective

01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:08.930
on people's support for science.

01:13:08.930 --> 01:13:11.570
Science is very reductionistic

01:13:11.570 --> 01:13:13.760
and we have this ideology that

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:16.490
scientists says we understand
fundamental particles.

01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:18.620
You understand the whole universe.

01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:21.100
Now, of course, there
are plenty of scientists

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:23.150
who don't buy into this dogma.

01:13:23.150 --> 01:13:27.590
But I think that it leads
to a sense among people,

01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:30.970
oh well, yeah, reductionist
science is great.

01:13:30.970 --> 01:13:32.270
I mean over the last several century,

01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:34.350
it's given us all this great technology

01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:35.830
and cures and all that.

01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:38.690
But it's just covering
part of the picture.

01:13:38.690 --> 01:13:42.940
And so that may explain part of this

01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:44.900
that people say, oh well,

01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:48.390
we're dealing in, say, a holistic realm

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:49.970
which the fundamentalists

01:13:49.970 --> 01:13:53.240
or the reductionist scientist
just don't wanna deal with,

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:58.230
and which a lot of the
primary spokesmen downgrade.

01:13:58.230 --> 01:14:00.300
I mean they tend to be looked down

01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:02.020
on people who take a holistic view.

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:04.020
They look down on people
who believe in God.

01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:06.380
And essentially they have a whole set

01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:07.687
of dogmas of their own.

01:14:09.450 --> 01:14:10.680
- Speaking as a biologist

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:14.640
I can't say that shoe
fits 'cause we deal with

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:17.333
a lot of integrative
phenomena, shall we say?

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:25.233
Thank you.

01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.903
Yes.

01:14:26.903 --> 01:14:29.870
Unfortunately we don't
have a lot more time

01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:31.550
so maybe these will be
the last two questions.

01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:32.900
- [Man] I'm wondering if you could comment

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:36.970
on the role of compulsion
in this situation.

01:14:36.970 --> 01:14:39.730
You've talked very eloquently about

01:14:39.730 --> 01:14:42.150
persuasion in education.

01:14:42.150 --> 01:14:44.370
Kitzmiller I think is more than an example

01:14:44.370 --> 01:14:48.213
of compulsion or trying to.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:55.200
I'm not sure we have the freedom

01:14:55.200 --> 01:15:00.200
to persuade in a long term
process about global warming.

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:04.730
It seems like the fate of Earth

01:15:04.730 --> 01:15:07.243
and our species hangs in the balance.

01:15:12.850 --> 01:15:15.170
- I don't know about you but I live

01:15:15.170 --> 01:15:17.200
in the United States and it's a democracy

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:20.020
and I can't compel
people to agree with me.

01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:24.400
However much better off
they would be, I must say.

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:27.820
But Kitzmiller, going to trial is actually

01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:32.480
a very good example of I think your point.

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:36.230
Everybody remembers Kitzmiller v. Dover.

01:15:36.230 --> 01:15:37.453
They remember the,

01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:42.360
we at NCSE, they're some
of my NCSE colleagues

01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:43.400
in the audience.

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:47.040
And they remember that year of preparation

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:49.080
for that six weeks of trial

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:52.160
and how totally exhausting
it was for all of us.

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:55.080
And you remember the cross examinations

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:57.780
and the judge's decision
and all this kind of stuff,

01:15:57.780 --> 01:15:59.330
all of which was very complicated.

01:15:59.330 --> 01:16:03.250
But preceding that for a year and a half,

01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:08.250
we and the citizens in
the city of Dover worked,

01:16:08.290 --> 01:16:10.890
we supported them, we
provided them information.

01:16:10.890 --> 01:16:13.830
They would go every single
school board meeting

01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:16.850
and try to persuade the school board

01:16:16.850 --> 01:16:21.100
to not compromise the
teaching of evolution.

01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:23.050
The policy was only the last step

01:16:23.050 --> 01:16:24.830
in about a year and a half

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:27.920
of really bad decisions on
the part of the school board.

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:31.320
The only reason Kitzmiller
v. Dover went to trial

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:34.860
is because that was the only recourse.

01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:37.730
You don't go to trial unless
you absolutely have to.

01:16:37.730 --> 01:16:39.030
That's the last thing you wanna do.

01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:42.380
It's exhausting, it's
devisive, and you may lose.

01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:45.210
But sometimes you have to do it.

01:16:45.210 --> 01:16:49.020
But if you can persuade
you're a whole lot better off.

01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:50.340
Yes, ma'am?

01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:51.173
- [Woman] Hi.

01:16:51.173 --> 01:16:52.010
Thank you, Dr. Scott.

01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:53.460
It's a pleasure to hear you.

01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:56.750
As a fundraiser, the
last three organizations

01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:59.520
that I have been working to build hope for

01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:04.520
are Catholic charities, the
Center for Climate Protection,

01:17:04.610 --> 01:17:06.340
and the Leakey Foundation.

01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:09.173
I believe that covers religion, evolution,

01:17:10.150 --> 01:17:12.630
and climate change.

01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:14.020
I'm curious.

01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:16.660
I agree with you and I wanna share

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:21.840
I've impacted change by
starting personal conversations

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:26.230
and you can start one tonight
with a relative on the phone.

01:17:26.230 --> 01:17:28.020
It works.

01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:30.830
And I will just ask what gives you hope,

01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:32.863
why do you still recycle.

01:17:32.863 --> 01:17:34.946
(laughs)

01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:43.090
- Well, it's very,

01:17:43.090 --> 01:17:47.700
I mean, there are two
questions that I got asked

01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:49.990
when I was director of NCSE.

01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:53.120
The most common question
was from creationists

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:56.100
which was if man evolved from monkeys,

01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:57.710
why are there still monkeys?

01:17:57.710 --> 01:18:00.073
They were convinced that,
oh God, I don't know.

01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:05.540
The second most common question that I got

01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:07.780
was from people on my side of the issue

01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:10.660
which was how do you put
up with these people?

01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:13.633
Why don't they just
drive you totally nuts?

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:19.720
And that's kind of the same
vein of your last question.

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.080
Pathological optimism.

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:26.107
Thank you for coming to hear me.

01:18:26.107 --> 01:18:29.237
(crowd applauds)

01:18:29.237 --> 01:18:31.654
(calm music)
