00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:07.979
Vsauce, Kevin here -- with a deadly dice game
that from your perspective gives you a 97.2%

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:09.560
chance of surviving.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.440
But from your friend Billy’s perspective,
there’s a 90% chance that this game kills

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.880
you.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.900
How does this make any sense?

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.550
Well, here are the rules of our theoretical,
potentially horrific game.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.970
One person walks into a room and rolls a pair
of dice.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.429
As long as they don’t roll double sixes,
they walk out of the room alive and they win

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:36.149
one million dollars.

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.469
The game continues but this time 10 people
walk into the room.

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.229
And an appointed roller rolls the dice and
if they don’t roll double sixes, all 10

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:49.940
people walk out of the room alive and with
a million bucks each.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.000
Each round the number of players in the room
increases by a factor of 10.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.920
So 1, 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000 and so on.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.210
Each participant only gets to play one round,
and as soon as double sixes are rolled, the

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.780
game is over forever.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.219
Also for this game we have an unlimited supply
of money and infinity people because we’re

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.939
gonna get to 10 billion people by the 11th
round and that’s more humans than we have

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:19.939
on Earth.

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:25.009
Oh, we also have a room that can hold infinity
people.

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.009
Suspend reality.

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:34.280
When an unlucky roller finally rolls double
sixes -- also called “boxcars,” or “midnight”

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.630
-- everyone in that room dies instantly.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.030
Kind of a grim game but a million bucks is
life-altering money so you may determine that

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.310
it’s worth the risk.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.030
After all, the odds of survival are in your
favor.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.979
Six sides on each of two dice, marked with
dots officially called pips, means there are

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.829
a possible 36 combinations you can roll.

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:08.640
That's a 1 in 36 chance you’ll roll double
sixes, which is only 2.77% repeating which

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.570
we’ll round up to 2.8%.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.661
To put it another way, there are 35 different
combinations of survive rolls and only 1 combination

00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:21.720
of death roll.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.391
You might think that the game could be played
for 18 rounds before there was a 50/50 chance

00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:34.620
of rolling double sixes because 18 rolls out
of 36 possible combinations is 50%, right?

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.470
Well, no that's actually not how we figure
this out.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.200
In fact, you’d have to roll 25 times for
a 50% chance of rolling double sixes thanks

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.310
to combinatorial probability.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.250
The easiest way to figure this out is actually
to put the problem in terms of success instead

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.250
of failure.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.680
So there’s a 35 out of 36 chance that our
roll will let us survive.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.680
To calculate the probability of the game-players
all having a certain number of surviving rolls,

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.420
we raise (35/36) to the nth power, where n
is the number of rounds the game is played.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.100
In 5 rounds, the chances that everyone survives
are about 87%.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.090
10 rounds and that drops to 75%.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.340
At n = 18 rounds, there’s still a 60% chance
that no one has rolled double sixes.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.640
It isn’t until the 25th round that the odds
shift against us.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.000
I mean, you COULD roll double sixes on the
very first try... it's just not likely.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.790
But each player is only playing one round,
and we know that 1/36 is about 2.8%.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.610
Which means, to you, the player, you have
a 97.2% of living and getting the money whether

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:59.510
you’re on your own in the first round or…
in Round 9 with 99,999,999 other people.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.160
But when your friend Billy hears that the
game has finished and that you were one of

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:11.230
the players, he knows there’s about a 90%
chance you’re no longer in the mortal realm.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.200
And he’s understandably concerned.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.799
After all, he is your best friend.

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.150
The reason he's concerned is very simple.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.360
Despite just a 2.8% risk of a dice-rolling
fatality, there’s about a 90% chance that

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.660
you were one of the unfortunate, recently-perished,
losers.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.850
The danger is a matter of perspective.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.670
You know you’ve got over a 97% chance of
surviving your round and getting paid.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.610
Your risk of death by double sixes is low.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.000
But poor, sad Billy realizes that because
of each round's escalation of players, the

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.270
final group that rolled double sixes and succumbed
to the deadly rules of the game, makes up

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:02.150
almost 90% of all of those who played… so
if you participated, you were likely in that

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.150
group.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:09.470
To Billy, there’s only a 10% chance you
survived.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.250
Your truth is that your chance of surviving
is extremely high.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.670
Your friend’s truth is that the chance of
you being dead is nearly 9 out of 10.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:25.770
In the double sixes death game, reality doesn’t
change -- but a person’s perspective can

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.580
flip that probability on its pips.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:36.780
And as always, thanks for watching.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:44.300
Um, I'm actually gonna go through all the
combinations right now um just on the.. on

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.300
camera.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.300
Okay so.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.590
So we have one one.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:48.590
One two.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:49.590
One three.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:50.590
One four.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.590
One five.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:52.590
One six.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.592
Two one.
