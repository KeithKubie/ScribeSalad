00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.830
Welcome to 3.091.
My name is Donald Sadoway,

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.660
and I'll be your lecturer this fall.
We've got plenty of room here if

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.490
you need to sit.
You can sit up the steps and in the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:43.330
aisles. We'll get things sorted out
in the next day or two.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:49.160
What I'd like to do today is to
introduce myself,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:01:06.053
introduce the subject,
introduce my plans.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:01:00.450
I have plans for you.
I have plans for you called plans

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.900
for learning because that's what
it's all about.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.360
People if you're coming in now,
you can sit up here, or you even can

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.810
sit on the floor up here.
It's one big happy family.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.270
So, let me begin by telling you
that 3.091 is the most important

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.360
subject that you will take at MIT.
It is the most important subject

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.080
that you'll take at MIT.
I truly believe that. But,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.810
you know, any professor who stands
before you should say the same thing

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.540
about his or her subject.
If they don't believe that,

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.270
they shouldn't be teaching. The
difference is,

00:01:46.270 --> 00:02:05.406
when I say it, I'm right.
It is the most important subject.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.500
I want to teach you things that you
are going to retain,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.000
you're going to take with you.
So, we need to get down to that.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.500
What I want to do is get you to
appreciate the unique perspective

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.000
that you will get from studying
solid-state chemistry.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.500
And so, what I want to do is begin
by doing a little bit of

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.000
introduction so you get to
know what's going on.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:27.640
So, I'm going to talk a little bit
about myself, about the staff,

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.290
and actually if I could ask the
teaching staff to start handing out,

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.930
there's three handouts that are
going to come to you.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.580
Just stay seated, we'll get them to
you. If you don't get them,

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.230
there's plenty of copies after.
And, we are going to post

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.880
everything on the website.
So, let me begin by doing a little

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.520
bit of background so you know what's
going on here.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.170
I was born in Canada.
I went to the University of Toronto

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.150
and I studied chemical metallurgy.
You might say,

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.460
well what's the person who studied
chemical metallurgy doing teaching

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.760
chemistry here?
Well, after my Ph.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.070
., I came here as a postdoctoral
fellow in 1977.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.380
The plan was to stay for a year or
two, and then go back to Canada,

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.690
and I lost track of time. So, I
joined the faculty in 1978,

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:37.913
and my first teaching assignment was
3.091 recitation.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:28.390
I had two sections.
One met at 8 am, and one met at 9

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.790
am. We don't have 8 am sections,
at least we haven't in recent years.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.190
Maybe it's time to revisit that.
So, my research is electrochemistry.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.590
That's why I'm teaching chemistry.
Electrochemistry is the most

00:03:44.590 --> 00:04:01.713
important branch of chemistry.
Why not?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:54.280
Find your passion and pursue it.
So, I'm interested in nonaqueous

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.570
electrochemistry.
I don't care about water.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.850
I'm interested in nonaqueous
electrochemistry,

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.140
so molten salts and polymers,
the applied research. First of all,

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.420
interested in environmentally sound
technologies for extraction,

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.710
refining, recycling of metals.
It's all chemical processes.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:33.953
Second, pardon me, second
is batteries.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:25.070
I want to have an all-electric
vehicle in my lifetime.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.150
I want to see the end of the
internal combustion engine applied

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.220
to personal mobility.
The only thing that stands between

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.300
us and that is a suitable battery.
So, find an important problem.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.380
Work on it, and to say nothing of
the wireless device there.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.460
She's driving, and she's talking on
the cell phone, and looking

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.840
at the photographer.
And last one, we have to dream.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.530
We have to dream beyond the
day-to-day living.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.230
Let's talk about the stars.
So, if we're going to go to the

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.920
moon, we're going to go to Mars,
we want to be able to produce oxygen,

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.610
structural metals and photovoltaic
materials from in situ resources.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.300
So, I have some research on that,
as well. So, that's the kind of

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:32.666
stuff: a little bit of background
about myself.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:21.120
So now, let's talk about the
perspective of 3.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.240
91. All of this will be posted.
You can take notes. You can just

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.370
enjoy. You don't have to worry
about getting tested on this

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.490
material, at least not on my life
story. That would be too

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.620
self-serving. So,
if you look at any engineering

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.740
system, the performance of that
engineering system is a function of

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.870
its design and its construction.
And, that can be anything from a

00:05:45.870 --> 00:06:05.406
computer to a living system.
We are solid-state devices.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
We are made of soft matter.
This is macromolecular chemistry.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
These are photodetectors, band gap
two electron volts,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
respond to visible light.
They're not made of gallium

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
arsenide. They are made of organic
matter: the same rules,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
the same laws of chemistry that
apply to what makes this laser glow

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
green apply to what makes these
photodetectors work.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Well, what about construction?
Construction is a combination of

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
workmanship and choice of materials.
Take this computer, if I pull the

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
silicon out, I replace it with
gallium arsenide,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
leave everything else the same.
Gallium arsenide switches ten times

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
faster than silicon.
All of a sudden, I've got a clock

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
speed ten times faster with no
change in design.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
So, that's the power of the choice
of materials, and why?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Properties. Materials are bundles
of properties.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Conceptually, they are bundles of
properties.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
What is this? You say it's an
aluminum can. No,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
it's a bundle of properties.
This is a beverage container.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
I could make this out of
borosilicate glass.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
I could make this out of polymer.
I could make this out of metal. I

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
could even make it out of steel
versus aluminum.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I could make it out of titanium if
I wanted. I could make it out of

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
gold. I'd prefer to make it out of
platinum if I had my way. Why?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:27.600
Bundle of properties: mechanical
strength, chemical inertness,

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:47.266
ease of fabrication: that's not a
unique solution.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.800
Cost, ah, there is a factor that
may be a determinant.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.400
So, properties, and where do we get
properties from?

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.000
Here: composition,
clearly. Everybody knows that.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.600
If you change the composition, you
change the properties.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.200
But this is different.
What I'm going to tell you now is

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:53.410
different.
What I'm going to tell you now is

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:58.240
why you take 3.
91. The properties are not only a

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.080
function of composition.
They are a function of the instant

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.910
atomic arrangement,
how we arrange the atoms: same

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:12.740
composition, simple example,
one inch thick pine board, one inch

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:17.580
thick plywood.
Both made of pine; both one inch

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:22.440
thick.
Which one has the superior

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:27.330
mechanical properties?
The plywood. Why? Because the

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:32.220
plywood has been sliced into thin
pieces that are laminated

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:37.100
cross-grain. So,
composition alone can't give you the

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:41.990
answer to the question,
why is the plywood superior to the

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:46.880
solid pine board?
It has to be the atomic arrangement.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.770
The thesis of 3.
91, and this is where the chemistry

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:56.660
comes in, is that electronic
structure of the elements holds the

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:01.550
key to the understanding,
not just the chemical bonding,

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:05.630
but the long range atomic order.
So, that's how we get to the

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.900
syllabus. So,
here's the syllabus: two big blocks,

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.180
first block general principles of
chemistry, and that's the same

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.450
whether you take 3.
91 or 5.111 or 5.112.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.720
This is your insurance policy.
This is what ensures that if you

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:38.440
take 3.091, you can go on
later and take 5.12.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:26.830
You could be a chemical engineer.
You can go to medical school. And

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:31.660
then, this is the specialty topics
that pertain to the devices,

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:36.490
engineering systems. So, let's turn
to the handouts now.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:41.330
What I'm going to do for about the
next 15-20 minutes is just tell you

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:46.160
what the class operation is like so
everybody knows.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:10:04.653
I want you to understand what
you've signed up for.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:54.760
The text is the one shown here.
It's out in second edition. It's

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.520
available at The Coop.
It's available at Quantum Books.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.290
There's even some first editions
out there which are very,

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:06.050
very similar. There are some minor
differences. There's some numbering

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.820
differences with some of the
homework problems.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:13.580
I don't care if you buy the book.
I don't work for Wiley. I don't

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.350
own shares in Wiley.
I don't own shares in The Coop.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:21.110
I don't care if you buy the book.
If you want the book, that's the

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:25.330
book I use.
Lectures, lectures are Monday,

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:29.990
Wednesday, Friday at 11:00, or
Monday, Wednesday,

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:34.660
Friday at 1:00. The enrollment,
last time I looked, is an even 600.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:39.330
So, the registrar's computer
divided you between this 11:00

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:43.990
lecture and the 1:00 lecture.
If you want to change lectures,

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:48.660
please go to Hillary or Lori, and
arrange it because as you can see,

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:53.460
some people don't have a seat.
If everybody goes to the assigned

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:58.390
place, there will be a seat for
everybody. So,

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:03.330
out of courtesy,
I think it's important that we

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:08.260
follow the assignment.
So, if you want to go at 1:00,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:13.190
you're welcome to do so, but please
arrange it with my assistants.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:18.130
The 1:00 lecture is smaller group.
It's about 150. And, it's around

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:23.060
the corner on the first floor
building, 6-120.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:41.720
So, 11:00 will be in 10-250,
and 1:00 will be in 6-120.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:31.810
So, that's Monday,
Wednesday, Friday, and that's the

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:35.630
standard lecture format: I talk,
you listen. I'm going to write

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:39.450
things on the board,
I'm going to post things up on the

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:43.270
screen, and so on.
Where you get a chance to interact

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:47.090
on a greater level is in the
recitations. The recitation is an

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:51.110
old, archaic, New England term.
If you go back to the colonial times,

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:55.350
education would be conducted in an
unheated room by someone who

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:59.580
basically hates children and would
come into the room and look at

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:03.820
someone, and glower and yell,
"Sadoway! Stand and recite!" I

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:08.050
would recite, whatever,
the Articles of Confederation.

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:12.290
I would rise on my hind legs,
quaking in my boots,

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:16.520
and I would begin until I made a
mistake, whereupon I would be

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:20.760
castigated, berated,
totally stripped of self-esteem by

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:40.920
this monster who would that inflict
the same pain on somebody else.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:28.590
That was education in the old days.
We are going to do it a little

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:32.190
differently this year.
So, in your recitations sections,

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:35.790
I have asked the instructors not to
do that. Instead,

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:39.390
you come to class. You control the
agenda. I have instructed them not

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:42.990
to give you a fourth and fifth
lecture. You come there with your

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.590
questions. You come to my lectures,
take some notes, maybe you don't

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.190
record everything I say.
Maybe record what you didn't

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:53.790
understand. Then you go to
recitation. The first thing they

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:57.390
are supposed to say is good morning
or good afternoon,

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:16.580
and then they say, what are your
questions?

00:12:41.000 --> 00:13:04.330
And, they draw up the agenda.
So, someone says I didn't

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.660
understand what he was talking about
at the end of the last lecture when

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.990
he was doing the Bohr model.
I didn't get it. Somebody else

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:14.330
will say, can you do number three on
the homework for me?

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:35.193
So, they draw up the agenda, OK?
So, those recitations occur Tuesdays

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
and Thursday. So,
you'll have a time,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
and you'll go to the same time on
the Tuesday and on the Thursday.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
The same thing applies here as with
the lectures. If you wish to change

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
sections, you may do so only with
permission of the subject

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
administrators because it's very
important that those sections be

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
kept at a small population.
I want to have the population at a

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
number no greater than 20.
That way you get good access to the

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:49.610
TA.
I don't want to have a section with

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.830
30 in it. So,
there are many sections.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:56.050
They run from nine in the morning
through four in the afternoon with

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:59.270
multiple sections through the middle
of the day, which are the most

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:02.490
popular sections.
And, if you'd like to change,

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:05.720
you can do so only with the
permission of the administrator.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.940
And, you have to have reason to do
so. You can't do it because,

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.160
I don't do mornings or because my
girlfriend is in this other section.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.380
No, I don't get freedom; I'm told I
have to be here at 11:00 Monday,

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:35.426
Wednesday, and Friday.
I can't go down to the registrar and

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:23.600
say, you know,
I'd really like to do it at another

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:41.600
time. No, no.
But if you have a UROP,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:32.400
or you have a sports practice or
something, we will allow that.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.800
So, please stick to the sections.
And, right now, because of

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:55.866
burgeoning enrollment,
we've opened up some sections.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:25.600
So, these three are underpopulated.
So, if you'd like to switch into

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.000
one of these three,
they have very low numbers right now.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:54.850
We've added an extra one at 11:00,
an extra one at 2:00, and we've

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:59.710
added one at 1:00.
So, if that meets your schedule in

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:04.560
a better manner,
then again, do it but only with

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:09.420
permission from Hillary or Lori.
Oh, by the way, talking about under

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:14.280
enrolled subjects,
the complementary subject offered by

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:19.140
STS called History,
Society, and Solid State Chemistry

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:37.680
meets Tuesdays and Thursdays at
11:00 in room 2-136.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:28.130
It is underpopulated right now,
so if you are still shopping for a

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:32.260
humanities subject,
this one bears the precious CI-H

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:36.390
designation. Think about that.
If it's a question about the time

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:40.530
of that, then perhaps raise it with
the instructor and see,

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:44.660
you know, we are talking about a
small number of people.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.790
I suspect that enrollment is going
to be in the dozens,

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:52.930
so it could easily be rearranged if
the time is conflicting with one of

00:15:52.930 --> 00:16:11.660
your other classes.
Homework: 3.091 is different.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:16:02.190
I give homework as a learning aid.
I give homework, and you'll see you

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:06.990
have homework questions with model
solutions at the outset.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:11.790
I want you to learn by studying the
homework. I'm not going to have you

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:16.590
work long hours on difficult
problems to be submitted and then

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:20.760
graded. I don't do that.
Part of this is designed to get you

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:24.290
to start thinking about the
transition from high school to

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:27.820
college. What I mean by that is I
want you to take ownership of your

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:31.350
learning. So,
I'm not going to come around and say,

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.880
did you do your homework?
And, I've got evidence that you

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.410
didn't do it because you didn't turn
it in. So, it's easy.

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:41.930
It's easy to blow it off.
And those of you who have had a lot

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:45.460
of chemistry, for the first little
while it's going to be a lot of

00:16:45.460 --> 00:17:04.720
review, and you're going
to get complacent.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:52.880
Don't do it. Develop good study
habits. The homework is a good test

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.760
of that. Make the time to work the
homework problems.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.640
But just to make sure,
to stimulate interest, every Tuesday

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.520
in recitation there'll be a ten
minute quiz based upon the content

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.410
of the homework.
So, if you've worked the homework

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:12.290
problems, you will do the homework
quiz handily. If you haven't looked

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:16.170
at the homework problems,
you might have difficulty with the

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:20.050
homework quiz.
So, there is no homework grade

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:24.350
based on turning homework in.
The homework portion of your total

00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:29.070
grade is the aggregate of all of
those weekly test scores.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:33.780
And, you must take the test.
If you fail to take the test,

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:38.490
you get zero, and I average the zero
in. If you don't make it to class,

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:43.210
contact your TA, your recitation
instructor, and you can take a

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:47.920
makeup within a week of the time of
original test.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:52.640
I want to give you every chance to
get caught up, but it's

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:57.080
your education.
I want you to take ownership of it.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:01.240
So, all scores count. There's no
dropping of lowest scores from the

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:05.410
average. Some of the other classes
perhaps do this.

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:09.580
People have actually confronted me
telling me it's an MIT rule.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:13.740
I've been here 26 years. I know
what the rules are.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:17.910
Speaking of homework,
here's homework number one.

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:22.210
So, it's assigned today.
You've got the model solutions,

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:26.640
and there will be a test in
recitation on Tuesday the 14th based

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:31.070
upon that homework.
And, it's based upon the homework

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:35.490
subject. So, I don't want somebody
coming in with an attorney saying,

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:39.920
well, the question looked a little
bit like 39, but it's not exactly.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:44.350
Well, I think you know what I'm
saying. Let's continue with the

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:48.780
administration.
In addition to the weekly homeworks,

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:53.760
there will be monthly tests.
And they've all been scheduled.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:59.300
So, you can plan. The monthly
tests are the following dates:

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:04.840
September 29, October 27,
November 17. The tests will be

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:10.380
written in the normal class period.
Now, I know you've had all this

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:15.920
bonding in the orientation period,
but I think that it's much better

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:21.460
when you write a test for there to
be some solid state defects known as

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:38.520
vacancies in between
the various people.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:30.860
So, on the day of the test,
we will have a shadow rooms.

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:34.730
And we will divide you. So,
some of you will write in here,

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:38.590
and some of you will write in some
of the other rooms.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:42.460
But you will write during the
normal class period.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:46.330
It will run the 50 minutes.
And, likewise, there will be a test

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:50.190
running from 1:05 to 1:55: two
different tests of comparable

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:54.060
difficulty. I did this last year,
and the difference in the scores on

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:57.550
all three tests was less than 1%.
So, I think we are capable of,

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:00.660
with the kind of assistance of my
staff capable of setting exams of

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.770
comparable difficulty.
But again, you are going to be

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.880
required to go to the room that
you've been assigned.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.990
Otherwise, we don't have enough
seats, or we don't have enough test

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:13.100
papers and so on.
By the way, on the tests,

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.210
you will be getting tomorrow these
handouts that you can use in working

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:19.330
the homeworks,
so when you are taking the test,

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:22.440
you are allowed to bring in the copy
of the periodic table

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.850
of the elements.
We give you a very rich table of

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:29.570
constants that's got all kinds of
things from the mass of the electron

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:33.280
to the speed of light,
and all this stuff to the requisite

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:36.990
number of significant figures.
And, in addition, you are allowed

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:40.710
to take in one sheet of paper,
one sheet 8 1/2 x 11, you can write

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:44.420
anything you want on it.
You can write on the front; you can

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:48.140
write on the back.
You can write on the edge for all I

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:51.870
care. You can write; you can print.
I've seen students photocopy exams

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:55.620
down to the size of a postage stamp.
I don't care what you write on

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:59.370
there. What it's designed to do is
to give you the resources you think

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:03.120
you need so that I can focus on
measuring whether you've learned

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:06.870
anything as opposed to whether
you've remembered,

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:10.620
memorized anything,
OK, and of course, something to

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:14.370
calculate with.
There is a final exam in this

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:18.120
subject. It's a three-hour final.
The final exam period is December

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.830
13 - 17th this year.
Do not plan to leave town until your

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:25.490
finals are over.
Do not come to your instructor and

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:29.160
say, I've got a really good ticket
but I'm leaving on the 13th.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.830
No, you are here for the finals.
But I will say, once you know your

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:36.490
final exams, schedule.
And, you should know that about

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:40.160
October 1. The registrar will
publish the schedule.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.830
Once you know that, get on the
phone, get on the Internet,

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:47.490
book your tickets. There are 30
degree-granting institutions in the

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:51.160
Boston area. They start at
different times.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:22:11.786
They all end just before Christmas.
Everybody and his pet dog is trying

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:59.600
to get a seat on a plane out of
Logan airport.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:19.466
So, once you know your schedule,
then you make your arrangements.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:22:08.400
But you must be here for the final.
Grading: for freshmen, it's pass,

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:26.866
no record. And,
to get a pass as a freshman,

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:57.200
you have to be performing at C level
or better. For upperclassmen,

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:21.600
you get the full range of the
alphabet, A, B,

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:40.000
C, D, F, it's all there,
available for you.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:30.140
What is the final grade made of?
I already mentioned homework. Now,

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:34.280
this is supposed to be one sixth,
but I know I don't want any

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.420
transcendental numbers here.
So, I made it 16.75 exactly.

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:42.560
So, it's roughly one sixth for the
homework. That's the average of all

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:46.710
of your weekly quizzes in the
recitation. Each of those three

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:50.850
monthly tests gives also a sixth.
So, one plus three is four, four

00:22:50.850 --> 00:23:09.700
sixths, which leaves two
sixths, or one third.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
So, the final is worth 33%,
all right? So, that's the breakdown.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
And, the grade is C level,
and it's based upon a performance of

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
50% absolute. I want you to learn;
I do not have you compete against

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
your classmates.
There is no curving of the grades,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
OK, no curving of the grades. How
do I know that that's an absolute

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
pass, though? Well,
when we set the exams,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
we set the tests, I sit with my TA's
and we say, all right,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
let's work out the point scheme on
this question.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:29.700
Let's say it's worth ten points.
I say, well, let's grade about five

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.410
or six of them,
maybe ten of them,

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:35.110
get a sense of it. If a person has
the basic concept down,

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:37.820
regardless of numerical errors,
if the person has the basic concept

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:40.520
down, he or she must get at least
five out of ten.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.230
If the person has not mastered the
basic concept,

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:45.940
the person must fail,
must get four or less.

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:48.640
And, if that's not the case,
then we redo the point scheme,

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.820
all right?
So, if you propagate that through

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:55.460
the whole year,
and you have the basic mastery of

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:59.110
the concepts, 50 is a pass.
That's the way we do it, no grading

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:02.760
on a curve. But,
I also look at trends.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:06.400
To show you the kind of attention
you get in this class,

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:10.050
on the 17th, Friday the 17th,
I know where I and my staff will be.

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:13.700
We are going to be in a conference
room not far from here,

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.350
and we are going to be reviewing
every person's performance in this

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:36.633
class. We're going to go
down the whole list.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:24.880
And, what we looking for?
We are looking for trends.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.770
We're looking for trends.
Obviously, if your aggregate score

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:32.660
is 75, you're passed.
But, I'm looking at what's going on

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:36.550
in the vicinity of 50 because I
don't think my point scheme is that

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:40.440
accurate. So,
suppose I have somebody who comes in

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:44.320
here with a shaky background in
chemistry from high school and gets

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:48.210
a failing score on the first test,
and works hard and improves, but

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:52.100
still fails the second test,
passes the third test, writes a

00:24:52.100 --> 00:25:11.266
decent final, and has an
aggregate score of 48.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:59.730
I have the freedom to pass that
person because I like the trend.

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:03.460
Suppose I have somebody else who
came here with two years of

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:07.190
chemistry in high school,
got a 95 on the first test,

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:10.930
70 on the second test, failed the
third test, failed the final,

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:14.660
has an aggregate score of 48. I'll
let that person sit there because

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:18.390
that person clearly didn't make the
investment. That person didn't take

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:22.130
ownership of his or her education.
That person isn't deciding to be a

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:26.250
part of the 3.091 community.
In fact, if that person has a 48 and

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:30.750
the first person who had the weaker
score has a 46,

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:35.250
I could still pass the person with
the 46, and fail the person with the

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:39.750
48. If I want to,
I can give the person with the 46 an

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:44.250
A. I can do anything I want because
I'm the professor.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:48.750
[LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] What else I
can do, there's no requirement for

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:53.580
me to fail anybody.
My management doesn't ask me what

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:58.740
I'm doing in here,
all right? They don't know.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:03.910
They really don't. So, if
everybody masters the material,

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:09.080
I can say A's on the house. They
don't say to me,

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:14.240
six bodies, one of them must fail.
No, so, my point is that I want you

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:19.410
to succeed, and I know you can
succeed. Faculty here have three

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:23.760
major professional activities.
One is teaching.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.290
One is research.
And the third is administration.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:30.820
We serve on committees. Well, for
the last three years I've been

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:34.350
chairing the committee on
undergraduate admissions and

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:37.880
financial aid.
I chaired the committee at the time

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.410
you were applying.
I read some of your folders.

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:44.940
I sat at the selection period where
we've got the stacks: 11,

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.460
00 applications. You went through a
grueling screening process.

00:26:48.460 --> 00:27:08.786
I know the quality of individual in
this room. I sat there.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:56.120
It was during the Patriot's Day,
no, the President's Day weekend,

00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:00.240
sitting here Friday,
Saturday, Sunday, Monday,

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:04.370
stacks of them going: yes,
no, hell no. [LAUGHTER] See,

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:08.490
tenure means never having to say
you're sorry. So,

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:12.620
you're here. 11,000,
and you made it. And I know that

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:16.740
everybody in this room,
first of all, belongs here.

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:20.870
Everybody in this room has the
intellectual apparatus not to just

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:39.140
pass 3.091, but to
flourish in 3.091.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
And, I want you to succeed.
The only people who fail 3.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
91 are those who choose to fail 3.
91. They choose not to come to

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
class. They choose not to work the
homework. They choose not to

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
interact with the recitation
instructors. I don't know why they

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
make that choice.
The website: the website has all

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
sorts of goodies including the
readings. You've got to read before

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:52.660
you come to class.
I'm not going to write them on the

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:55.990
board like a little high school
teacher. I'm not doing that anymore.

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:59.330
You are taking ownership.
So, you go the website. The other

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:02.660
thing you will find on the website
are old homeworks,

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:05.990
old exams, all sorts of resources,
and they are videotaping this. By

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:09.330
the way, they are videotaping it in
a sort of heightened technology this

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:12.660
year. And so,
some of this is going to end up on

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.990
Open Courseware.
So, if any of you doesn't want to

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:19.330
be, by chance,
seen on the Internet,

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:22.520
then sit out of range of the camera.
I guess that's all I can tell you.

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.570
So, that's why there's all these
cameras here. So,

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:28.630
you can click on this.
It's On Demand. So, if you by

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:31.680
chance, I know it's very rare,
but if by chance you don't get the

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.730
class you can always follow up later.
It's also on a vernier,

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:37.780
a sliding scale. So, if there is
one section of the lecture that I

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:40.830
went a little too quickly for,
you could say, gee, if I could just

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:43.890
see that five minutes,
you could click on it, zoom into

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:46.940
that five minutes,
play it a few times,

00:28:46.940 --> 00:29:07.613
and then say, I still don't know
what he's talking about.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:52.760
And then you go to a recitation
instructor. So,

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.520
this is what happens.
You go to the website,

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.280
there's all these bars down the side,
so there's lecture videos.

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:01.040
There is lecture topics. That's
where the readings are.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.800
And, there's a whole bunch of other
information there,

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.570
and then a list of recitation
instructors. So,

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.330
here's the reading.
So, for example today,

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:12.090
there is a vision statement,
administrative details and I'm going

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:14.850
to get a little bit of teaching
towards the end.

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:17.610
And, if you wanted to,
you could crack the book and look at

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:37.420
chapter one. So, that's the drill.
But, again, that's up to you.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000
A couple of topics, a little bit
unpleasant, but we have to cover

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.000
them. The management doesn't care
what I say in terms of chemistry.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.000
But, they really care about this
stuff. So, I'm going to obey.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.000
So, academic honesty: very simply,
you can't cheat in 3.091. Is that

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.000
shocking? No cheating! You know
this. The Roman poet philosopher

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Juvenal said men need not so much be
informed as reminded.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:30:01.330
You know this.
I'm telling you nothing new.

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:04.660
So, when you take a test, you don't
accept information from others.

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.990
You don't represent as your own
work the work of anyone else,

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:11.320
and you don't use aids to memory
other than those permitted by the

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:14.660
examiner. I'm giving you an aid
sheet. You've got the table of

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.990
constants. What else do you need?
It's enough. And, following a test,

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:21.330
a lot of people write in pencil:
don't try to erase something and

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:24.660
bring it back and say that,
oh, actually, this is what I had

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:44.453
because we look at that and
go, this is perfect.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
How do we miss something like that?
Don't do that. And, also, we're

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
trying to teach you on many levels.
We're trying to teach you some

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
chemistry, but I'm also trying to
teach you how to transform into a

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
standalone professional.
In the code of conduct,

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
professional conduct,
that we embody by this code here is

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
comparable to what you are expected
to adhere to in your

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
professional lives.
You don't publish results that

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
you've faked. You don't publish
results that you stole from others

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
and represented as your own.
So, don't start here. And, it

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
happens infrequently,
but I've got to tell you,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
a few years back on the final exam,
a couple of people were involved in

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
passing information back and forth.
They got caught. You know why they

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
got caught? Because for the first
time, you're being taught by people

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:23.930
who are smart as you are.
So, you're going to get caught.

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:27.790
My TA's are really smart. So,
don't think it's like back in,

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:31.660
pick a place, I could offend
somebody. It's not like we're back

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:35.530
in Ontario, how's that?
That's where I came from.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:39.390
You're here now. So, don't try it.
You're going to get caught. These

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:43.260
guys got caught.
I had to press the case to the

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:47.130
committee on discipline.
One of them did not return for his

00:31:47.130 --> 00:32:06.060
sophomore year. That's
a crazy thing to do.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:54.680
It's a huge price to pay in a
pass-no-record first semester class.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:58.360
And, you know who is most severe on
the committee on discipline?

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:02.050
It's made of faculty,
administrators,

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:05.730
and students. And,
guess who the most severe members of

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:09.420
that committee are?
It's the students, your peers who

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:13.100
are outraged at that kind of
behavior. Speaking of behavior,

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:16.780
I have to maintain a fertile
learning environment in here.

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:20.470
We've got round numbers in excess
of 400 people sitting here,

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:24.150
so I expect certain things here,
and that's how we're going to get

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:42.766
along.
First of all, no conversations,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
no talking. A little conversation
here, a little conversation there,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
it adds up. So, I insist, no
talking. Please,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
no food or drink. No food or drink.
We're seated cheek to jowl here. I

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
don't want somebody opening up a
clamshell with some hot food in it.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
It's not right. It's not right.
Plus, there's all kinds of trash

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
left around. Nobody
picks up the stuff.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:56.300
Now, this is an exception.
This is for medicinal purposes.

00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:00.610
It's to make sure that my throat
doesn't get dry.

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:04.920
And, I swear, it really contains
Fresca. And, of course,

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:09.230
no disruptive behavior, no
disruptive behavior.

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:13.530
Wireless communication devices must
be silenced. So,

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:17.840
from this moment forth,
and I heard some stuff go off

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:36.146
earlier.
But, I let it slide because I

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
haven't had my chance to explain
what my expectations are.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
But, from this moment forth,
cell phone goes off, you're out.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
You leave the room, OK? And, Lord
help you if a cell phone goes off

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
during an exam because those things
have text messaging capabilities.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000
If your cell phone goes off during
an exam, I come up there.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
I grab your paper, I tear it in
half, and I give you a zero.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000
I am teaching you professional
behavior. That's unprofessional.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000
You can say that I'm over the top on
this. I've got 450 people.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000
I want to maintain a fertile
learning environment.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000
When you walk through that door,
it's an act of free will. It's an

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
act of free will.
Somebody's leaving.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Bye. Let's go. Let's get it
started right now.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Please. It makes noise when you
turn it off?

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
You owe these gals dinner,
I tell you. All right, turn them

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
off. If they have to make noise as
you turn them off,

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000
turn them off, but that's it.
So, when you walk through that door,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
it's an act of free will.
And, we enter into a contract.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
You walk in here, you have certain
expectations of me.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
You expect me to conduct myself
professionally.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
You expect me to respect you.
You expect me not to use foul

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
language. You expect me not to say
offensive things to you.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
You expect me to have a
well-prepared lecture.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Well, you know what? I have
expectations of you.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
I expect you to come to class
prepared. I expect you to sit there

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
quietly, respect your neighbors.
I expect you to contribute to the

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
learning environment.
That's not unreasonable,

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000
is it? Good.
You ever look in the course bulletin?

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
You ever wonder what this is?
This is the listing for 3.091,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
5-0-7. Five hours is contact time.
That's three hours here, and two

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
hours with the recitation instructor.
Zero, there's no lab.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Seven, I wonder what the seven is?
That must be the time you spend in

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
preparation in studying.
So, I make a pledge. You give me

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
seven hours a week,
you will pass this class,

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
not just by the skin of your teeth.
You will pass it.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:53.640
If you don't give me seven hours a
week, I don't know what I can do for

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:57.290
you. So, I want you to be
successful. So,

00:35:57.290 --> 00:36:00.930
I put this up. This is sort of
venues for learning: recitation,

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:04.580
reading, homework, so, that's my
responsibility,

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:08.230
the lecture. Recitation: that's got
to be the staff.

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:11.870
You, you're responsible for the
reading. You're responsible for the

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:15.520
homework, the quizzes,
the tests, the final exam.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:19.170
So, what we have here is a
partnership, a partnership

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:23.070
in learning.
What we want is for you to grow.

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:27.230
Franklin said education is what
remains when you've forgotten all

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:31.380
your schooling.
So, we want you to have some

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:35.530
retention here.
So, we've got a few minutes here.

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:39.690
I don't want you to just have you
go from room to room with people

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:43.840
saying, welcome to MIT.
So, I want to talk a little bit

00:36:43.840 --> 00:37:02.613
about taxonomy, classification,
nomenclature.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:51.660
I said at the core blitz that one of
the things I'm going to try to do is

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:55.330
introduce some things from beyond
chemistry. So,

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:58.990
let's see what the Bard had to say
about nomenclature.

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:02.660
There may even be people here who
distinguished themselves because

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:06.330
they starred in Romeo and Juliet.
Or, maybe they produced. Maybe

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:09.990
they built the sets.
Maybe they wrote the screenplay.

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:13.660
I don't know. So, let's look, Act
II Scene II. You remember this,

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:17.330
Romeo: "but soft, what light through
yonder window breaks.

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:36.193
It is the east, and Juliet is the
sun."

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:24.860
That has nothing to do with
nomenclature, nothing.

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:28.730
Photon emission, perhaps.
OK, let's get to nomenclature.

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:32.590
Juliet: "oh Romeo, Romeo, wherefore
art thou Romeo?

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:36.460
Deny thy father and refuse they
name, or if thou wilt not,

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:40.330
be but sworn, my love, and I'll no
longer be a Capulet.

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:44.190
She's a Capulet. He's a Montague,
you know, like the Hatfields and the

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:48.060
McCoys, the warring families,
two lovers, it's as old as

00:37:48.060 --> 00:38:07.286
literature that's here.
OK, so now, Romeo: "shall I hear

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:37.500
more, or shall I speak at this?
Fellows, a bit of advice, don't

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:42.500
interrupt. The answer to that
question is, no,

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:47.500
don't speak. So,
Juliet: "'tis but thy name that is

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:52.500
my enemy. Thou art thyself,
though not a Montague. What's

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:57.500
Montague? It is nor hand nor foot
nor arm nor face nor any other part

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:22.450
belonging to a man.
Oh, be some other name.

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:27.360
What's in a name? That which we
call a rose by any other word would

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:32.270
smell as sweet.
So Romeo would,

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:37.170
were he not Romeo called.
Retain that dear perfection which

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:42.080
he owes without that title.
Romeo, doff thy name, and for that

00:38:42.080 --> 00:39:01.493
name, which is no part of thee,
take all myself." That's an offer.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:53.230
In science, it works differently.

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:57.690
In science, we have to agree. It
can't be like Alice in Wonderland.

00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:02.150
I'll give the word the meaning I
intend it to mean.

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:06.610
Science has to have some rigor.
So, if you look in chapter one, you

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:11.070
will find these definitions for
different atomic groupings starting

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:15.530
down here with the elements and
moving through up through complex

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:34.793
matter. This is solid state up here,
aggregates of atoms.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:23.780
So, we're going to begin down in the
lower left corner.

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:27.570
We're going to begin in the lower
left corner. So,

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:31.360
let's look at some of the origins of
chemistry. We can go back to

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:35.150
ancient Egypt where there is
reference in the hieroglyphs to term

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:38.940
khemeia, which,
among other things,

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:42.730
meant chemical processes for
embalming the dead.

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:46.520
You know, the Egyptians were very
concerned about afterlife?

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:50.310
They wanted to be well preserved to
make that journey.

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:54.100
So, practitioners who understood
what we would know to be chemistry

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:58.360
were highly valued in that society.
And then, you may expand it to other

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:03.080
chemical processes,
dyeing of cloth, glassmaking,

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:07.810
and metals extraction. It's magical.
It's sorcery to take an ore and

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:12.540
convert it to metal.
It's magic. It still amazes me

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:17.270
today. Gee, you know,
I showed you this earlier.

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:35.140
One of my areas is extraction of
metals.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:26.660
You know, some things never change.
And then, they tried to make an

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:31.330
overarching theme,
an overarching theme,

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:35.990
to go to the heavens. So,
there were seven known metals at the

00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:40.660
time, and seven heavenly bodies.
So, obviously, the sun would be

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:45.330
gold. Mercury is a liquid metal,
and mercury, the planet, is the

00:40:45.330 --> 00:41:05.126
fastest moving naked eye heavenly
body. Mars, iron, why is Mars red?

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:54.710
Iron oxide. And,
in fact, you can even couch things.

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:59.420
So, if I wanted to make a bronze,
which is an alloy of tin and copper,

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:04.140
I could say the confluence of Venus
with Jupiter, and that way keep it

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:08.850
so that the common folk would know
the secret of the alloy.

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:13.570
So, now, let's look at the
transition from craft to science,

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:18.280
craft to science. About 2,400 years
ago, we have Democritus.

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:36.560
And, Democritus moves from practice
to theory.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:29.750
And, this is all that was known at
that time, seven metals,

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:47.066
carbon, and sulfur. And so,
here was his idea of the structure

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:43.250
of matter. It's about 400 B.
. And, what did Democritus do?

00:41:43.250 --> 00:42:00.900
He described the physical world as
the integral of void plus being.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:56.600
He used lofty terms.
And, being he described as an

00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:03.200
infinity of indivisible particles,
which he dubbed atoms from the Greek.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:09.800
Tomi means to slice,
and A as in apolitical,

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:16.400
amoral, so a-tomi is something that
is indivisible,

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:33.000
cannot be sliced.
And, he says these are eternal.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:09.000
And, in between,
there is void, which is very similar

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:15.000
to how we would describe vacuum.
This is 2,400 years ago. This

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:21.000
depiction of matter takes you right
up to E=MC squared.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Brilliant. And, that's all he had
to work with for data.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:52.720
That's all he had to work with.
But, science doesn't always move

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:58.180
forward. After that came Aristotle.
And, Aristotle gave us this system,

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:03.630
which persisted almost through the
Middle Ages. And,

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:09.080
Aristotle gave us this,
and I'll leave you with this.

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:14.540
And, you can ponder. So, this is
the Aristotelian view.

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:32.213
He's got four essences: Earth,
fire, water, air.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.500
You could even make compounds: Earth
plus water makes cold.

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:09.000
I mean, this is nuts. This is nuts.
But it was there for over a

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.500
thousand years,
and we now know things to be a

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:18.000
little different.
And so what I'm going to do the

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.500
next day is return to this
discussion, and take a look at a

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:27.100
more rational view of the chemical
world. So, we'll see you on Friday.
