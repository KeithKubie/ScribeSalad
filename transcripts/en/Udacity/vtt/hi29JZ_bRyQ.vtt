00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.762
Gardner clearly expanded the scope of intelligence to include many cognitive

00:00:03.762 --> 00:00:08.058
and behavioral abilities. But, with the added domains, means that there isn't a

00:00:08.058 --> 00:00:11.779
high correlation between each area of intelligence. So you could be really high

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:15.340
in one area of intelligence, but not so high in another. Greg, do you have

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.000
anything to add about Gardner's theory of intelligence?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.797
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Gardner's theory has been very appealing to both educators and

00:00:20.797 --> 00:00:25.018
psychologists in the United States and in Europe. But what they've had to do is

00:00:25.018 --> 00:00:29.640
develop a whole curricula and schools around multiple intelligences.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.903
&gt;&gt; That's interesting. So it's obviously pretty hard to test this type of

00:00:31.903 --> 00:00:34.698
intelligence because that's not a simple pen and paper test like there are for

00:00:34.698 --> 00:00:36.901
the traditional IQ tests.

00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:40.895
&gt;&gt; That's right. In fact Gardner acknowledges that. He knows that there's no way

00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:44.415
of simply taking a pen and paper test to test for interpersonal intelligence

00:00:44.415 --> 00:00:49.719
for instance. So what educators have to do in these schools is they have to

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.689
have projects and activities, creative activities interpersonal tasks, that

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:57.430
they evaluate.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.223
&gt;&gt; Okay, so let me ask you this. Now, how do you think you are intelligent?

00:01:01.223 --> 00:01:07.085
&gt;&gt; Well, I would say I'm pretty high on verbal and interpersonal.

00:01:07.085 --> 00:01:10.964
&gt;&gt; Intelligence not so high on musical intelligence.

00:01:10.964 --> 00:01:15.099
&gt;&gt; So let me ask you this. How are you intelligent?
