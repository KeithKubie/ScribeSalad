00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.240
Where we left off
in the last video,

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.070
we were beginning
to try to figure out

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.380
what the 24 roots of 1 were.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.380
And then we were going
to square those 24 roots,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.820
take the absolute value
of their imaginary part,

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.350
and then sum them up.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.810
Once again, let's just think
about the roots that matter.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.470
So this over here, we figured
out this is pi over 12.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.355
So let me-- this is pi over 12.

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:24.980
That's the angle, I
guess I should say.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.160
That's e to the pi over 12i.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.250
Let me just focus
on the angle, here.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.200
This over here is 2 pi
over 12, or pi over 6.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.920
This over here is 3 pi
over 12, or pi over 4.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.020
This over here is 4 pi
over 12, or pi over 3.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.425
And this right over
here is 5 pi over 12.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:53.050
And then this, obviously, is
6 pi over 12, or pi over 2.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.560
We could keep going, but
before we keep going--

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.470
and this will
really just simplify

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.070
the math a little
bit-- remember,

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.350
we're going to have
to square these roots.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.850
So let's just think
about if we have

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.460
some complex number,
a plus bi, let's

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.660
think about what happens
when we square it.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.780
This is going to be
equal to a squared

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.960
plus 2abi minus b squared.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.310
Or we could rewrite it as
a squared minus b squared--

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.760
will be the real part--
and then, plus 2abi.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.690
2ab is the imaginary part.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.490
And the reason why I
even took the trouble

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.590
of writing it this
way is to realize

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.520
that what we're
going to do is we're

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.680
going to square all of
these complex numbers,

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.710
and then take the absolute
value of the imaginary part.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.200
So really, all that matters
is the absolute value of 2ab,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.840
or really, 2 times the
absolute value of ab.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.050
Now these guys all
have analogs where

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.280
either a or b would be negative.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.780
So if this guy is--
this right over here--

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.450
let's call this, a plus bi.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.510
If you had a minus bi,
you would be down here.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.979
So if this guy is a
plus bi, a minus bi

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.474
is going to be over here.

00:02:10.474 --> 00:02:11.890
Or you could have
negative a minus

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.760
bi is going to be
over here, or you

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.820
could have negative
a plus bi over here.

00:02:21.592 --> 00:02:23.050
But the reason why
I did this is we

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.410
showed you, just over
here, all of these guys

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.310
when you square
them and you take

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.430
the absolute value
of the imaginary part

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.230
of that squared value, it's
all going to be the same.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.290
Because when you take--
it's going to be ab,

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.100
absolute value is
going to be ab.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.650
Negative ab absolute value
just still going to be ab.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.490
So they're all going
to be the same.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.410
So what we can do is--
and each of these guys

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.826
are going to have
the same analog.

00:02:43.826 --> 00:02:47.140
So what we could is just find
the values for these guys one,

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.020
two, three, four, for
these five guys over here.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.620
And then just multiply whatever
we get by 4, because they

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.740
each have-- I guess there's
four of these around the unit

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.970
circle, and that'll
save a lot of our work.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.150
Now, the other thing we
want to think about-- we

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.956
already said that
we have to ignore 1,

00:03:04.956 --> 00:03:06.080
because we added that root.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.913
But even if we didn't
remember to ignore it,

00:03:07.913 --> 00:03:10.950
it wouldn't matter, because 1
doesn't have an imaginary part.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.900
1 squared is still 1-- does
not have an imaginary part.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:21.850
We can also ignore an angle
of pi over 2, or 90 degrees,

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.170
because this has no real part.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.680
And you see over here,
that when you square it,

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.430
it's actually going
to take you over here,

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.160
and it won't have
any imaginary part.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.435
When you square it it's
2 times the real times

00:03:32.435 --> 00:03:33.260
the imaginary part.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.330
This has no real part,
so this is going to be 0.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.060
So this guy will
also not contribute.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.100
So we really just care about
these angles right over here.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.590
And then we'll square them,
find the absolute value

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.630
of their imaginary
parts, and then we'll

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.350
multiply everything
by 4, because that'll

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.970
correspond to these
other-- if you

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.760
took the imaginary or the real
parts and made them negative.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.094
And it would take us all the
way around the unit circle.

00:03:56.094 --> 00:03:57.510
So let's think
about a little bit.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.930
Let me just write
these over here.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.320
So the z's that we'll
think about right now

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:12.870
are going to be e to the pi
over 12, e to the pi over 6, e

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.730
to the pi over 4-- oh,
e to the pi over 12i,

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:22.590
I should say-- pi over 6i, pi
over 4i, e to the pi over 3i,

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.470
and then we have e
to the 5 pi over 12i.

00:04:30.496 --> 00:04:32.120
Now we're going to
square each of them,

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.419
and it's nice to leave it
in this exponential form

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:35.210
when you square it.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.246
It's much easier to
square these values.

00:04:37.246 --> 00:04:39.120
If you square this,
you're just, essentially,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.800
multiplying the
exponent times 2.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.350
So this is going to be
e to the pi over 6i.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.070
This will be e to the pi over
3i-- we're just squaring them.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.180
So we're just taking
the square of each

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.360
of these values,
each of these roots.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.830
So e to the pi over 3i,
and then here you're

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.450
going to have e
to the pi over 2i.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.355
And over here, you'll have
e to the 2 pi over 3i.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.090
And then finally over here,
you'll have e to the 5 pi

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.790
over 6i.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.582
Now these are the squared
values of these roots here.

00:05:25.582 --> 00:05:27.665
Now, let's just think about
their imaginary parts.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.510
So this guy right
over here can be

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:39.900
rewritten as cosine of pi over
6 plus i sine of pi over 6.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.710
So his imaginary part
is sine of pi over 6.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.560
This guy's imaginary part--
if you expand it out,

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.520
Euler's identity,
Euler's formula.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.340
Cosine of pi over 3 plus
i sine of pi over 3.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.180
So this imaginary part is just
going to be sine of pi over 3.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.270
Here is going to be
sine of pi over 2.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.270
Here is going to be
sine of 2 pi over 3.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:16.660
And here is going to be
a sine of 5 pi over 6.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.410
Now we just have to
evaluate these guys,

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.370
and take their absolute
value, and then take the sum,

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.240
and then multiply
everything times 4.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.990
And we're essentially
in the home stretch.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.150
So pi over 6 is 180--
if we were in degrees,

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.137
and my brain has an easier
time processing that.

00:06:34.137 --> 00:06:36.470
So, actually, let me draw
another unit circle over here,

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.920
just so we can
visualize these angles.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.100
So now we have
sine of pi over 6.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:48.260
Pi over 6 is the same
thing as 30 degrees.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.090
So it looks like this.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:55.290
And we know that the sine
of 30 degrees is 1/2.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.760
This is one, this is 1/2,
this the cosine square root

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.320
of 3 over 2.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.480
But this right
over here, is 1/2.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.490
Sine of pi over 3.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.595
pi over 3 is the
equivalent of 60 degrees.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.750
The sin over here is
square root of 3 over 2.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.580
You can figure that out
from 30, 60, 90 triangles.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.330
Then you have sine of pi over 2.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.430
Pi over 2 is that
right over there.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.680
Well, the sine of
that is just 1.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.320
So this is the
imaginary part of this,

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.540
or I guess, this would
be-- essentially,

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.967
this evaluates just to i,
but the imaginary part,

00:07:34.967 --> 00:07:36.800
which is viewed as the
coefficient on the i,

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.510
which is kind of non-intuitive.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:39.670
You would kind of think
it's the whole thing,

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.294
but when people say
the imaginary part.

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:44.480
So this will just be 1.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.990
And then sine of 2 pi over 3.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:53.770
Let's see, that is-- so
pi over 3 is 60 degrees.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:56.670
So you could view
that is 120 degrees.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.780
So it's 120 degrees.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.370
So it's right over here.

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:09.470
So it's going to have the
same sin value as pi over 3,

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.250
so it's going to be
square root of 3 over 2.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.230
And then, sine of 5 pi over 6.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.860
Pi over 6 is 30 degrees.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.620
So this is sine of 150 degrees.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.500
So it's going to
be just like that.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.450
And it's going to have the
same sine value as pi over 6.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:29.390
So it's going to be
1/2, and lucky for us,

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.096
these are all positive values.

00:08:31.096 --> 00:08:32.220
So let's just take the sum.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:40.000
And so we have 1/2 plus
1/2 is 1, plus another 1

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.590
over here is going to be
two, plus the square root

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:48.520
of 3 over 2 plus square root of
3 over 2 is square root of 3.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.270
Now remember, we just did it
for this quadrant over here.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.020
We have to do it for
all of the quadrants,

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.010
so we just need to multiply
everything times 4.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:01.520
So the sum of the absolute
value of the imaginary part

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:10.540
of the square of the roots is
8 plus 4 square roots of 3.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.970
And going back to
the original problem,

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:13.980
we got the answer here.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.934
This is 8 plus 4
square roots of 3.

00:09:17.934 --> 00:09:19.600
I want to make sure
I didn't mess it up.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.100
Right.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.000
8 plus 4 square roots of 3.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.040
So if we want find m plus
n plus p, it is 8 plus 4

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.340
plus 3, which is equal to 15.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.130
And we're done.
