00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
&gt;&gt; With respect to the economic crisis and
the financial crisis of the

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.370
past couple of years, we're concentrating
at Davos and working with the

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.660
other G-20 countries in making sure that we
are in agreement on

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.279
continuing stimulus for next year, because
the economic recovery is

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.769
modest and there's a lack of evidence of firm
private sector demand

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.269
return ing.
So we need to continue the public sector demand

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.939
which is through the
stimulus program, not only in Canada but in

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.820
the other G-20 countries.
We're also looking at avoiding this kind of

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.350
crisis in the future or
minimizing the impact of it by a mutual assessment

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.820
process which is
designed to be done by the International Monetary

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.059
Fund.
And we've had discussions here today about

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.100
the best design of that.
We'll follow up those discussion with discussions

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.809
in [INAUDIBLE]. The
G7 Ministers and bank governors from the G7

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.440
countries next weekend.
And then at the G-20 meetings at Cinema Stoka

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.360
and Toronto in June this
year.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.070
So we have a lot of work to do on the financial
regulation side and the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.470
reform of financial institutions in the G-20
which is now the premiere

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.920
forum for financial economic discussions in
the world.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.270
Lots of work to do to get ready for the meeting
in June in Toronto.
