I have a new book out a path appears
 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.619
I have a new book out a path appears
which is essentially about how to make a

which is essentially about how to make a
difference and it addresses all those

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580
difference and it addresses all those

fulfillment but don't really know how to
 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.519
fulfillment but don't really know how to
go about that and in working on the book

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529
go about that and in working on the book

arose for me this research arose when I

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320
arose for me this research arose when I
 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.410
arose for me this research arose when I
was writing for my column for The New

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420
was writing for my column for The New
 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.660
was writing for my column for The New
York Times about Darfur back in 2004 and

I was going to villages that had been

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160
I was going to villages that had been
 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.420
I was going to villages that had been
burned out talking to people who were

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430
burned out talking to people who were
 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.639
burned out talking to people who were
survivors of massacres and it was

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649
survivors of massacres and it was
 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.170
survivors of massacres and it was
frustrating to me that I couldn't get

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180
frustrating to me that I couldn't get
 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.810
frustrating to me that I couldn't get
people to pay more attention to this and

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820
people to pay more attention to this and
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.209
people to pay more attention to this and
meanwhile at that very same time here in

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219
meanwhile at that very same time here in
 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.549
meanwhile at that very same time here in
New York City there was a red-tailed

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559
New York City there was a red-tailed
 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.950
New York City there was a red-tailed
hawk called Pale Male that had been

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960
hawk called Pale Male that had been
 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.350
hawk called Pale Male that had been
kicked out of its nest off Central Park

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360
kicked out of its nest off Central Park
 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.450
kicked out of its nest off Central Park
and New York was all up in arms about

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460
and New York was all up in arms about
 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.160
and New York was all up in arms about
this homeless Hawk and I thought how is

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170
this homeless Hawk and I thought how is
 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.740
this homeless Hawk and I thought how is
it that I can generate as much passion

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750
it that I can generate as much passion
 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.750
it that I can generate as much passion
about hundreds of thousands of people

about hundreds of thousands of people
 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.280
about hundreds of thousands of people
being slaughtered as people feel for

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290
being slaughtered as people feel for
 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.980
being slaughtered as people feel for

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990
this hawk that led me to this area of
 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.080
this hawk that led me to this area of

and it turns out that our engagement

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530
and it turns out that our engagement
 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.390
and it turns out that our engagement
with a cause it's not about numbers it's

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400
with a cause it's not about numbers it's
 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.969
with a cause it's not about numbers it's
not about classes of victims it's really

not about classes of victims it's really
 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.039
not about classes of victims it's really
about two things it's first of all it's

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049
about two things it's first of all it's
 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.060
about two things it's first of all it's
emotional and it's with individuals that

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070
emotional and it's with individuals that
 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.280
emotional and it's with individuals that
we have evolved we were hardwired to

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290
we have evolved we were hardwired to
 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.870
we have evolved we were hardwired to
feel a certain amount of empathy and a

feel a certain amount of empathy and a
 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.590
feel a certain amount of empathy and a
connection but with one other person

connection but with one other person
 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.300
connection but with one other person
whom we see whom we can relate to not

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310
whom we see whom we can relate to not
 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.830

with a hundred thousand people half a
world away the other thing is that we

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630
world away the other thing is that we
 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.510
world away the other thing is that we
want to feel like we're having an impact

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520
want to feel like we're having an impact
 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.670
want to feel like we're having an impact
so we want some kind of a positive art

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680
so we want some kind of a positive art
 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.770
so we want some kind of a positive art
we want to see a difference being made

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780
we want to see a difference being made
 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.380
we want to see a difference being made
and so when aid organizations talk about

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390
and so when aid organizations talk about
 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.889
and so when aid organizations talk about
five million people at risk and make it

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899
five million people at risk and make it
 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.719
five million people at risk and make it
sound terribly depressing they're

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729
sound terribly depressing they're
 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.900
sound terribly depressing they're
precisely hitting the buttons that turn

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910
precisely hitting the buttons that turn
 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.940
precisely hitting the buttons that turn
people off one of the things that really

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950
people off one of the things that really
 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.500
people off one of the things that really
struck me was there been experiments

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510
struck me was there been experiments
 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.240
struck me was there been experiments
that ask people to do

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250
that ask people to do
 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.820
that ask people to do
ooh some math equation solve some math

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830
ooh some math equation solve some math
 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.100
ooh some math equation solve some math
problems first and it turns out that if

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110
problems first and it turns out that if
 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.450
problems first and it turns out that if
you do that if you exercise the more

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460
you do that if you exercise the more
 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.820
you do that if you exercise the more
rational parts of your brain then you're

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830
rational parts of your brain then you're
 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.680
rational parts of your brain then you're
less empathetic you're less likely to

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690
less empathetic you're less likely to
 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.660
less empathetic you're less likely to
contribute those of us who care about

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670
contribute those of us who care about
 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.190
contribute those of us who care about
these issues we need to figure out how

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200
these issues we need to figure out how
 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.680
these issues we need to figure out how
to do a better job a storytelling about

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690
to do a better job a storytelling about
 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.140
to do a better job a storytelling about
individuals and showing that there is a

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150
individuals and showing that there is a
 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.840
individuals and showing that there is a
possibility of hope some of the research

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850
possibility of hope some of the research
 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.030
possibility of hope some of the research
about our preference for helping

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040
about our preference for helping
 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.610
about our preference for helping
individuals over classes of people comes

individuals over classes of people comes
from experiments where people were asked

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480
from experiments where people were asked
 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.990
from experiments where people were asked
to contribute in some cases to this

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000
to contribute in some cases to this
 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.740
to contribute in some cases to this
child one that was used was Rokia a girl

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750
child one that was used was Rokia a girl
 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.220
child one that was used was Rokia a girl
from West Africa versus a large group of

people millions people suffering
malnutrition in Africa and of course

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560
malnutrition in Africa and of course
 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.040
malnutrition in Africa and of course
everybody wanted to contribute to Rokia

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050
everybody wanted to contribute to Rokia
 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.510
everybody wanted to contribute to Rokia
to that girl they wanted to help that

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520
to that girl they wanted to help that
 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.530
to that girl they wanted to help that
girl they didn't really care about

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540
girl they didn't really care about
 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.780
girl they didn't really care about
millions of people being malnourished

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790
millions of people being malnourished
 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.250
millions of people being malnourished
but what was striking is that you know

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260
but what was striking is that you know
 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.780
but what was striking is that you know
even though we I think intellectually

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790
even though we I think intellectually
 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.440
even though we I think intellectually
know that you know one death is a

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450
know that you know one death is a
 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.330
know that you know one death is a
tragedy and a million deaths is this is

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340
tragedy and a million deaths is this is
 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.270
tragedy and a million deaths is this is
a statistic that at the point at which

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280
a statistic that at the point at which
 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.020
a statistic that at the point at which
we begin to be numbed is when that

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030
we begin to be numbed is when that
 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.259
we begin to be numbed is when that
number when N equals two the moment you

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269
number when N equals two the moment you
 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.320
number when N equals two the moment you
added not just Rokia but had a boy next

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330
added not just Rokia but had a boy next
 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.940
added not just Rokia but had a boy next
to her and said you can help these two

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950
to her and said you can help these two
 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.310
to her and said you can help these two
hungry kids then people were less likely

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320
hungry kids then people were less likely
 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.300
hungry kids then people were less likely
to contribute than if it was just Rokia

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310
to contribute than if it was just Rokia
 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.800
to contribute than if it was just Rokia
likewise people are less willing to

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810
likewise people are less willing to
 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.199
likewise people are less willing to
contribute to a fund to save kids from

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209
contribute to a fund to save kids from
 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.420
contribute to a fund to save kids from
cancer if there is if the same amount of

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430
cancer if there is if the same amount of
 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.310
cancer if there is if the same amount of
money is gonna save not one life but

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320
money is gonna save not one life but
 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.160
