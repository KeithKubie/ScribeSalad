[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:07.820
ERIN SODERBERG: Thank you very
much for joining us today.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.370
We'll be talking with Tom
Miller about his new novel,

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.074
"The Philosopher's Flight."

00:00:12.074 --> 00:00:13.740
I actually went to
high school with Tom.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.070
We're both proud graduates
of Wauwatosa West High

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.200
School in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.210
And from there, Tom
went on to study

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.460
at Harvard, Notre Dame, and
the University of Pittsburgh.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.870
And he's an ER
doctor in Madison.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.190
And I'll actually let Tom
tell you a little bit more

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.214
about himself and
about his new book.

00:00:30.214 --> 00:00:30.880
TOM MILLER: Yes.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.310
So, I'm a second year
resident right now,

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.550
and took time off for
medicine to write full time,

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.210
and wrote the book we're
going to talk about and read

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.730
a little bit from today.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.920
During that time,
and sort of really

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.600
worked on revising
it during that time.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.440
It had been a
project I started--

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.270
I think, in earnest-- around
the end of 2009 or early 2010,

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.370
but had been kicking
around some of the ideas

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.559
for going back probably
almost 10 or 15 years now.

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.600
What do you need to know?

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.760
Let's see, should I
describe the book,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.252
or describe the
world a little bit?

00:01:09.252 --> 00:01:10.960
ERIN SODERBERG: Yeah,
Give us a synopsis.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.210
TOM MILLER: It's the trouble
with fantasy novels, much

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.900
less historical fantasy novels.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.910
But you really only need
to know three things

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.850
about "The
Philosopher's Flight."

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.260
Thing number one is that this
is set in America in 1917

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.010
in a world in which magic--

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.880
though nobody calls it magic--
it's empirical philosophy,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.950
and it's definitely not magic.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.370
But magic was discovered
about 200 years earlier

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.222
and caused the world to evolve
in a different way as a result.

00:01:38.222 --> 00:01:39.680
Thing number two
you should know is

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.610
women are a lot better at
philosophy, or sigilry--

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.030
as it's also known--

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.020
than men.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.860
And that has caused a lot
of suspicion and hostility

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.300
over the years.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.550
And thing number three is that
the protagonist, whose name

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.600
is Robert Weekes, is one
of the rare men who is

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.180
good at empirical philosophy--

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.040
which makes him a
little bit unusual.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.540
ERIN SODERBERG: Great.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.092
Would you mind reading to us?

00:02:10.092 --> 00:02:10.800
TOM MILLER: Yeah.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.340
So, I'm going to
read a little bit

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.200
from the middle, which
is sort of doubly

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.067
a dangerous thing to do.

00:02:16.067 --> 00:02:17.650
So to catch you up
on what's happened,

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.650
Robert has grown
up his whole life

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.320
raised by his mother
and his three sisters.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.400
All of them are
really very gifted,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.450
very powerful philosophers,
and sort of brought him up

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.680
to do it as well.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.480
He ends up earning a scholarship
to Radcliffe College, which,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.030
if you want to study
philosophy, obviously,

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.310
you go to a women's
school to do that.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.590
So Robert is one of three
men at Radcliffe in 1917.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.510
And that meets with all sorts
of skepticism or cattiness

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.130
or outright hostility
and violence at times.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.110
He has dreamed his
whole life of following

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.310
in his mother's footsteps.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.670
His mother was part of the
United States Sigilry Corps,

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.850
which is sort of
the military version

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.490
of empirical philosophy.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.620
And she was what's termed
a rescue and evacuation

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.300
helicopter, so our rescue
and evacuation flyer.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.850
So, if, like me, you grew up
watching episodes of "M*A*S*H"

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.670
where the helicopters
fly in with the wounded

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.610
at the beginning, that
is sort of what they do,

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.600
though I should show you
the pictures of this.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.710
So, flyers-- and
this requires me

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.960
to back up and probably
explain a little bit more

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.850
about how philosophy works.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.540
But Robert, when he flies,
where's the harness?

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.650
And part of the reason he wears
a harness is to keep his powder

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.580
bag attached to his body so
he doesn't lose it or drop it.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.500
The way philosophy
works is that you

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.677
draw figures called sigils with
particular kinds of powder.

00:03:55.677 --> 00:03:57.760
So for different effects,
you draw different types

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.060
of pictures, different
sigils or symbols.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.000
And those produce
different effects.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.080
To fly, he has a mix of corn
powder-- so very finely ground

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.960
corn meal, as well as sand
and some other chemicals--

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.250
and a large 8 or 12 pound
bag with a regulator

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.000
at the end with
a fine tip on it,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.050
so he can control how fast
the powder trickles through.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.570
Every eight seconds or so,
he draws a different symbol.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.570
And that continues to provide
power so that he can fly.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.340
I think that's really about
all that you need to know.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.777
So Robert's dreamed
his whole life

00:04:32.777 --> 00:04:34.360
of following in his
mother's footsteps

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.060
and joining in rescue
and evacuation.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.360
And of course, that's
impossible because he's a man.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.360
And no man has ever
done that before.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.940
So this is from
chapter 21, for those

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.159
of you following along at home.

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:50.950
"The following week
brought with it further

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.670
miracles and wonders.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.370
Brock--" oh, dear.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.780
So, Professor Brock is
one of the professors

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.090
of practical or
empirical philosophy.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.340
And she teaches flying.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.110
"Professor Brock
reopened the aerodrome

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.460
and unveiled our new
hovering instructors--

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.050
10 corps veterans who'd been
pensioned off due to age.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.890
All the Radcliffe women who
were still interested in flying

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.230
assembled on the landing
field to be divided up

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.150
among the old crones.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.650
One after the next,
the instructor

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.560
stepped forward to call out
the names of their trainees

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.660
and lead them into
the aerodrome.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.816
But my name wasn't
on any of the lists.

00:05:27.816 --> 00:05:29.940
I would have thought I was
being singled out again,

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.560
but Essy was left
unassigned, too.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.410
We stood alone on the field
looking for some indication

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.390
of what we were supposed to do.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.970
'Bookkeeping,
here?' I suggested.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.010
Essy chewed at her lip.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.990
An ancient lady leaning
heavily on a cane

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.880
hobbled out of the aerodrome.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.610
She wore thick spectacles and
had a pair of field glasses

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.870
on a leather strap
around her neck.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.500
She hadn't been introduced
with the other instructors.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.500
She stopped in front of us
and straightened painfully.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.560
'Well, this is a sorry state
of affairs,' she drawled.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.260
'Out of this entire
aerodrome, only two hoverers

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.170
have dared mule the phrase
rescue and evacuation

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.240
in connection with
their own names.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.400
One is fewer flight hours than
any of my great grandchildren,

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.420
and the other has a phallus.'

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.040
As he blushed to hear
such coarse language,

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.550
the old lady pointed at her.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.230
'You're Sarah Stewart?' 'Oh,
ma'am, I go by Essy, if--

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.390
'That's a weak name,
a child's name.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:23.680
Stop using it.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.350
Now, get kitted out and scout
me three different landing

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.486
approaches to Harvard Square.'

00:06:28.486 --> 00:06:31.990
'Ma'am, we're not allowed to
hover between--' 'The Cambridge

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.570
Police Department has
no way to catch you.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.750
I want you to land and
then record the paper

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.470
three approaches
with compass headings

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.870
and lists of potential
obstructions for each.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.160
Give it to me in one hour.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.240
Get a bag and get up.'

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.690
If Essy was torn
about committing

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.990
a technically illegal act, she
overcame her doubts quickly.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.060
She tried it toward
the aerodrome.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.480
'Run!' The woman bellowed, as
he accelerated to a sprint.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.040
'And you,' the old lady said.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.070
'Let me see if I
have this right.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.690
Conducted a solo
search and rescue

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.880
mission over rough
country in Montana

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.880
and lifted out three souls.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.790
Dove into the river here
to save a drowning hoverer.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.430
Ran a mass casualty
evacuation on zero minutes

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.310
notice, and flew a
goddamn 40 foot stringer.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.980
I would say that just about
makes you the best male flyer

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.780
in the world, doesn't it?'

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.210
'No, ma'am,' I said.
'Oh, Mother Mary,

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.780
but he doesn't understand.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.230
Child, I was in
the corps 55 years.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:26.790
That's before
modern hovering was

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:28.770
invented, to save you the math.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.570
Back at '11, they
said to me, Gertrude,

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.160
you're too old to fly.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.249
So I instructed
at Fort McConnell.

00:07:34.249 --> 00:07:35.790
Then, this year,
they said, Gertrude,

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.260
you're are to mean to teach.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.410
We've got a war on, and we don't
want every third girl quitting.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.110
So they retired me.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.450
And Janet Brock, with all her
gold medals and monographs

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.700
and Professor of
Such and Such, said

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:52.285
she had a man worth training--
a man for the corps, for RNE.

00:07:52.285 --> 00:07:55.050
What better revenge for
invaliding me out than

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.710
to dump on them a man
who's too good to refuse.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:02.850
So, do you think a moment of
my prodigious experience would

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.030
waste her golden years on
anything less than the finest

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.700
male flyer on Earth?'

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.310
'No, ma'am," I said.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.160
'Good.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.600
I want you to believe it.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.084
I want you to train like it.

00:08:14.084 --> 00:08:15.750
And if you choose not
to boast about it,

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:19.080
then that's your business,' as
if I would dare have said such

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.910
a thing in the aerodrome.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.220
'Show me your hands'
Gertrude said.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.030
I extended my hands for her.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.790
I had dirt under my
nails and calluses

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:28.800
all rough and yellowed,
but she wasn't

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.390
checking for cleanliness.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:33.000
She produced a tape measure
from the work bag at her hip

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.309
and measured my thumb
and index finger, then

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:38.370
across my palm in several
different dimensions.

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:41.400
'You have lovely, long,
girlish fingers,' she said,

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.720
nodding her approval.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.480
'Do you know how to fly a lever
regulator?' 'I grew up with

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.720
them,' I answered.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.420
'Then, no more
the dial regulator

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.500
trash they favor here.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.410
You'll fly a Chesapeake Mark 20
lever regulator with a 2 inch

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:56.010
conical tip, three twist
bird board to 80 mil.'

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.140
'I don't think we have--'
'Janet found a used one.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.730
She ground the tips herself.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.282
Now, kneel, or I won't
be able to reach.'

00:09:02.282 --> 00:09:03.990
I knelt and she made
further measurements

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.740
across my neck, chest, hips,
thighs, belly, and shoulders,

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.400
recording each with the stub
of a pencil in a little book.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.900
'Beg your pardon,' she muttered.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.940
She put few glances
to her eyes in time

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:19.020
to Essy dash out of the
aerodrome in full harness.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.870
'Run, run, run,'
the woman bellowed.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.850
Essy flung herself into the air.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.070
The old lady checked
her wrist chronometer.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:28.320
'6 minutes and 40
seconds to kit out,

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.090
and then a three step launch.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:31.860
Christ in a fish barrel.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.340
And she flies
pretty, god damn it.'

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.660
She turned back to me.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.010
'Brown, or black?'

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.000
She asked.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.700
'Excuse me?' 'You're riding a
Springfield harness with a lot

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.490
of homemade improvements?'
'Yes,' I said.

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:45.090
'Not anymore.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.192
We're bringing you up
to the 20th century.

00:09:47.192 --> 00:09:49.650
Janet should have had you in
custom tackle from the day you

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:50.565
came in.'

00:09:50.565 --> 00:09:53.460
'Oh, I can't afford--'
'You're not paying for it.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.080
Brown leather, or black?'

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.177
'Brown.' She noted that
too, and put her book away.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:04.510
'Now, what do you weigh first
thing in the morning after

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:05.860
you've voided?'

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.840
She didn't mean
anything untoward by it,

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.200
and I didn't take it that way.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.950
'I'm not sure,' I said. 'I don't
have a--' 'Then buy a scale

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:12.640
later today.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.130
Give me an estimate.' '211.'

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:15.970
She winced.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.560
'Your stand 72 and
1/2 inches tall.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.696
I don't want to fly
above 186 pounds.

00:10:20.696 --> 00:10:22.570
Are you going to faint
on me at that weight?'

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:24.156
'Probably not,' I said.

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:26.030
'Then you're on a diet
starting this morning,

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.738
unless you care to
dabble in transporting

00:10:27.738 --> 00:10:28.990
to improve your figure.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:29.710
I don't judge.

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:32.590
Powder flow for your current
weight will be 8.9 ounces per

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:33.340
minute.'

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.876
I was aghast at the
powdered expenditure,

00:10:35.876 --> 00:10:37.750
not her comments regarding
weight loss, which

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.399
was simple physics.

00:10:39.399 --> 00:10:41.440
'A little more cornmeal
than you used back home?'

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.310
She asked.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.120
'Four times more,' I said.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.570
'I'd be burning through
powdered like mad.'

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.380
'Well, you're not paying
for that, either.'

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:50.260
Then she laid herself
down on the ground.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.280
'Prove you're worth the effort.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.810
I'll play the role
of your casualty.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:55.740
As fast as you can, I want
you to run into that building,

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.820
kit out, and grab
whatever style of harness

00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.290
you intend to fly me in.

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.590
Then launch, take me 2 miles
out to sea, turn and land

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:03.430
back here.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:04.150
And, oh, shoot.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:06.670
You happened to be out of
silver chloride this morning.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:07.990
Supply me awake.

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:11.920
Clear?' 'Perfectly.'
'Then, run,' she bellowed.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.339
I grabbed my harness and
sprinted for the aerodrome.

00:11:14.339 --> 00:11:16.630
'And if you can't do this in
half the time it took that

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.110
little daddy's girl, I'm sending
you straight back to the farm.'

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:21.820
I sprinted harder.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.070
There was a line of women
snaking out the door waiting

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.030
to draw powder and equipment.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.740
One of the other old sigil
women watched my approach.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.580
'Clear the way for a hot e-vac!'

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:31.570
She yelled.

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.820
The girl stepped aside
to let me through.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.100
Professor Brock was
behind the counter.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.290
'A 2 and 1/2 general
purpose bag,' I pounded.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:42.130
'Chesapeake 20 ounce regulator
with a 2 inch--' 'Fine, fine.'

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.110
Roxanne handed over
the items that she'd

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:45.742
had waiting right beside her.

00:11:45.742 --> 00:11:47.200
I'd already slipped
into my harness

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.210
and was cinching
down the leg straps.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:51.430
'I hope you're enjoying
yourself,' Professor Brock

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.970
said.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.330
'I had to message every--'
'--and a 20 foot loop of 1 inch

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:56.900
cotton webbing.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.310
Brock looked flummoxed.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:59.620
'Oh, come on,' I said.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.840
I attached my bag to my
hip as Brock pulled out

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.660
the aerodrome's catalog
to see where we stocked

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.130
such a piece of rigging.

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:07.824
The old lady at
the door laughed.

00:12:07.824 --> 00:12:10.240
She took a cloth bag from her
belt and tossed it underhand

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.470
to me. 'Gertrude's 74 years
old,' the only slightly younger

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:15.340
woman said.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:19.492
'Be gentle.' 'Yes, ma'am,' I
answered, and ran back out.

00:12:19.492 --> 00:12:20.950
I shook the webbing
out of its bag.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:22.960
It was nothing more
than a single long strap

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.570
with ends sewn together but
it made the world's quickest

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:26.490
harness.

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:28.170
I skidded to a stop
next to Gertrude,

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.610
who was lying flat on her
back, and laid the webbing out

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.800
in a circle around her."

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.390
At this point, I have
to stop and tell you

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:36.850
about a job I used to have.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:40.376
I was an EMT basic
for a number of years.

00:12:40.376 --> 00:12:41.950
And the only thing
I remember how

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.860
to do from my vehicle
rescue course,

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.380
in which we learned to use
the jaws of life and fun stuff

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.170
like that, is a
harness that you can

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:53.080
use for lowering
somebody out of a window,

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.211
or dragging somebody
across the ground.

00:12:56.211 --> 00:12:58.210
I never actually had to
do it on a living human,

00:12:58.210 --> 00:12:59.900
but it's actually very easy.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:03.000
All you do is pull the
rope up between the legs,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.920
and then reach under
the armpits, pull up,

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.540
and you have a harness sort of
like your playing Cat's Cradle.

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:16.017
"I skidded to a stop
next to Gertrude

00:13:16.017 --> 00:13:18.350
who was lying flat on her
back, and laid out the webbing

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:19.970
in a circle around her.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:22.190
'Oh, for the love of Saint
Jude, are you serious?

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:25.640
Web harness?' 'You said as
fast as I could,' I gasped.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.050
'So do it.'

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:29.680
I yanked a loop of webbing
up beneath her feet

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.580
and up between her
legs, then reached

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.730
through it to pull up the
strap from under her armpits.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.205
I hauled her to her feet
and clipped to my harness

00:13:37.205 --> 00:13:39.300
so that we were
chest-to-chest, the old lover's

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.230
clinch position,
undignified, but fast.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:43.839
'Go!' She barked.

00:13:43.839 --> 00:13:45.380
I launched, trying
to make it gentle,

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.470
and then poured on speed as
I rushed toward the Atlantic.

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.950
I was unbalanced, my
regulator was unfamiliar,

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:53.540
and the power flow
rate was absurd.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.340
I struggled to keep
us on the level.

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.140
We reached the ocean
in three minutes.

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:58.910
I turned and reversed course.

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:00.560
'You OK?' I asked.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.330
'Had worse,' she replied.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.510
'Mind me asking,
ever land like this?'

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:06.710
'Nope.'

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:08.540
Over the field, I
descended briskly.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.600
'I have bad hips,' Gertrude
warned. 'Bad ankles,

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.470
bad knees--' I cut our vertical
speed and splayed my feet wide

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:17.810
so that she touched down first.

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:19.450
This had the
unintended consequence

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:22.070
of thrusting my pelvis
right into her bosom.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.950
I brought my legs down crumbling
into a crouch to support her.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:27.710
I had to grab her rump to
keep us from toppling over.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.070
Some bright young thing
gave us a wolf whistle.

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:31.410
'Quiet on the field!'

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.650
Gertrude bellowed.

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:35.510
I unclipped her and
retrieved her cane.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:38.640
She polished her glasses and
set them back on her nose.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.270
'Wonderful at my age, that I
should experience something

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:42.350
new,' she proclaimed.

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:44.270
Are you married Mr. Weekes?

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:45.680
I blushed crimson. 'No, ma'am.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.920
I'm terribly sorry that I
touched--' 'Sorry nothing.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.200
I grabbed every last
piece of wounded soldiers

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.640
to get them up and down.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.710
No, Mr. Weekes,
you misunderstand.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:56.510
Better for you if
you were married.

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.600
Go pick one of those pretty
girls, make lots of babies--

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.510
girl babies, if you please--
and teach them to fly.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.380
Your daughters
will be brilliant.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.500
'Was I that bad?'

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.470
I asked.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.590
'No, you dumb ass,
you're adequate.

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:11.101
A woman who flew like that
could get a test Fort Putnam

00:15:11.101 --> 00:15:11.600
tomorrow.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.640
And she'd be in
France by Christmas.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.700
If you were shorter, I'd suggest
a wig and a set of bosom pads,

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.710
but you'd never pass for a lady.

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:21.770
So for you, a man,
to join RNE, you're

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:23.570
going to have to fly perfect.

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:25.640
And that's a
miserable existence.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.100
I wouldn't wish it on you.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.480
Go and settle down instead.'

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.980
I had a brief
vision of Dar in me

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.600
with a brood of
daughters, all of them

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.090
with dark, wavy hair
and perpetual frowns,

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:36.635
scolding me on some
point of politics

00:15:36.635 --> 00:15:38.870
and then flying rings around me.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.750
I rather liked it,
but not just yet.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.550
'I came to fly,' I said.

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:46.190
Gertrude nodded, as if it would
have been impossible for me

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:49.780
to answer differently. 'Then fly
it again unladen at best speed,

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:53.100
and show me your hottest
landing.'" And I think

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.010
I'll stop it there.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:57.530
ERIN SODERBERG: Thank you.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.010
So, as we've just
heard, the novel

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:02.840
is set during World War I,
predominantly in Boston.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.590
And one aspect of this book that
I find particularly striking

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:10.220
is how it manages to both feel
very historically accurate,

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.410
like this this could
have actually been

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:15.470
the world during World
War I, but it also

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:17.150
feels really relevant today.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:20.390
There are a lot of
issues and themes

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:23.600
in the book that also feel
like this book could happen now

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.640
in the same way.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.650
So, as far as the
historical context goes,

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:30.920
how much historical
research did you do?

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.180
TOM MILLER: I think the
best answer to that is some,

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:37.910
or that would be my degree from
the University of Wikipedia

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.570
on that sort of thing.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:43.790
So, I've read some on both
on the First World War

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:46.610
and a couple of books on
the suffrage movement,

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.100
as well as sort of
letters home from women

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:53.810
who were in the Red Cross and
other things from that era--

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:56.430
so some research
into the era itself.

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.550
And then, the important
thing for me as well,

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:02.390
was sort of working out
that alternative timeline.

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.940
Because really, in
this world, women

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.579
have had the vote
for about 50 years.

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:11.030
So in some ways, that's
sort of more similar to

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:16.040
if you're doing it based
on actual history--

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.710
more like the 1960s,
in some ways--

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:22.670
women have had effective
widespread cheap

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:25.604
and readily available birth
control for about 50 years

00:17:25.604 --> 00:17:27.020
as well at this
point, which maybe

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:30.610
makes it something
closer to 2015

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:32.300
in some of the social mores.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.880
But in other ways, things
have not advanced that much.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.300
So trying to figure out
socially, politically,

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:43.050
and economically where are
we in terms of evolution,

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:45.080
were important questions.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.640
So some of it is set in a
world very close to 1917.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.705
And other parts of it are
much more contemporary.

00:17:51.705 --> 00:17:52.580
ERIN SODERBERG: Yeah.

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:57.170
So the parts of it that feel
really culturally relevant

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.096
today, those were
done on purpose.

00:18:00.096 --> 00:18:00.970
TOM MILLER: Somewhat.

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:04.850
And I started writing
it a long time ago.

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.920
If we say it was seven
years or so in the writing,

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:13.210
it was back in about 2010
that I started a lot of it.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:18.900
I didn't write it particularly
with the Me Too moment in mind

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:26.490
or with the idea of sort of
regressive sexual politics

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:28.425
in the executive branch.

00:18:28.425 --> 00:18:31.180
But those things
ended up happening.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:34.290
So it was sort of a
confluence of things.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:37.741
So it's a little bit on
purpose, but not quite.

00:18:37.741 --> 00:18:39.240
ERIN SODERBERG: One
of the many ways

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.940
in which this book feels
very current and timely

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:45.360
is this whole concept of
being other or being different

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.770
in the world that the
protagonist is in.

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:49.770
So, as you said
earlier, Robert is

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:53.280
one of only a few men at an
all girls school studying

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.350
a predominantly
female discipline.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.524
This all feels very
close to home for me.

00:18:57.524 --> 00:18:58.815
I'm a female software engineer.

00:18:58.815 --> 00:19:01.500
So sometimes, I also
feel the same way

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.290
that Robert must feel
from time to time.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:05.970
And philosophers,
in general, are

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:11.550
treated as outcasts and even
with violence by some people.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:14.140
And in the opening sentence of
the book, Robert's daughter--

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:18.870
this is in the future from
where the part that Tom read--

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:21.990
his daughter asks him,
why do so many people hate

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:23.970
empirical philosophers?

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:27.570
And this kind of question,
it feels like something

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:29.640
a kid would ask their
parents today, just

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.070
replace the word
philosopher with any

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:34.920
of a bunch of other words.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.820
Was this particular theme
of otherness purposeful?

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.130
And did you write with any
particular marginalized

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:44.354
communities in mind?

00:19:44.354 --> 00:19:46.020
TOM MILLER: I think,
what I wanted to do

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.460
was write, again,
specific to the world.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:53.250
So I didn't want to do a
one-to-one sort of comparison

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:59.160
with immigrants or people of
particular ethnic background

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.160
or sexual orientation.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.930
But to think a little bit
about incorporating widely

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:07.781
from each of those.

00:20:07.781 --> 00:20:09.780
To me, the important thing
as I was writing it--

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.960
because I did not want
this to be about a world--

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.530
gosh, what would it be like
if straight white males

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.230
were the ones who were
discriminated against?

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:23.580
It's a little bit of
boring question to ask.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:26.040
And the important thing
that happened as I wrote it

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.040
was more and more,
that insight into--

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.850
so, Robert's facing
a lot of opposition

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.980
to becoming an
empirical philosopher.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.609
Danielle, who's his best friend
and eventually, his girlfriend,

00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:37.150
is interested in
going the other way.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:40.590
And she's a war hero who
wants to get into politics.

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.930
And the opposition
she experiences--

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:47.160
which is probably much
closer to real-world 1917--

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.960
is much more intense.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.930
So, did I have a single
population in mind

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:51.580
as I wrote it?

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.900
No, but I hope that
there's enough in common

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:59.790
between sort of what's faced
by any particular marginalized

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:01.650
group--

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:05.580
be it, to some extent, a
midwesterner at Harvard,

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:09.840
somebody who is 10 years
older than his medical school

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:16.000
classmates, or one of the
first men at Radcliffe.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.410
Some of that this is
a little bit the same,

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:20.850
or some of those feelings
are a little bit the same,

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:22.184
regardless.

00:21:22.184 --> 00:21:23.100
ERIN SODERBERG: Great.

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.690
So you mentioned
Danielle, who's one

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:28.260
of the many female
characters in the book.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:31.300
And this is another aspect of
this book that I just love.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.840
So because Robert is
at an all girls school

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.270
and he was raised by
his mom and his sisters,

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:40.770
he is surrounded by
strong, powerful women

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:43.590
who are all uniquely capable.

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:46.280
They're all
intelligent and strong

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.010
but in vastly different ways.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:51.300
And I'm curious about where
you got the inspiration for so

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.550
many diverse female characters.

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:56.860
And are any of them based
on the women in your life?

00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:00.810
TOM MILLER: I would say, pretty
much no, autobiographically.

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:06.324
Maybe taking a little bit
composites of people I knew.

00:22:06.324 --> 00:22:07.740
Particularly, in
the sequel, which

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:10.950
is a much more military setting
when I wasn't sure what to do,

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:16.080
I just asked, what would
one of the female trauma

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.750
surgeons I've worked with
say in this situation?

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:22.680
It was often a useful exercise.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:27.070
But let's see, Gertrude who was
on today, if she were a man,

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:29.430
I think would be quite a sort
of boring, straightforward

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.930
character.

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:32.570
She's the R. Lee
Emery character--

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:34.532
I've got the name
slightly wrong.

00:22:34.532 --> 00:22:36.990
She's a drill instructor from
"Full Metal Jacket," she just

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:40.080
happens to be a grandmother, and
limited in what profanity she's

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.060
allowed to use.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.850
Likewise, Emaline,
I think, if she

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:48.450
were Robert's dad
would say, well, that's

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:49.890
something like
the Great Santini.

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:52.340
This is a retired
military officer.

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.690
He's kind of strict
in a discipline area.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:59.460
And this is the son who wants to
follow in those same footsteps.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.210
But in the simple
inversion of gender,

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:05.190
I don't know, something
becomes different

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:09.790
or slightly uncomfortable about
it, in a productive way to me.

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:13.320
ERIN SODERBERG: Yeah, there
are many fantasy novels

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.990
in the world, but
not many that feature

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:18.100
as many uniquely interesting
female characters as this one

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:18.910
does.

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:19.960
I appreciate that.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.679
TOM MILLER: Well, excellent.

00:23:21.679 --> 00:23:23.470
ERIN SODERBERG: So,
about another character

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:27.700
who I find particularly
interesting, Dean Murchison.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.050
Is he based on anyone
you actually knew?

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:31.400
A professor you had, maybe?

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.750
TOM MILLER: He is not.

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:36.100
The special assistant
Dean is based

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:41.200
on any number of very
efficient sort of assistance

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.140
to department chairs,
or things like

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:45.760
that I've met over the years.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.700
Dean Murchison himself is
one of the rare other male

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:50.040
philosophers.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:54.040
And he's quite powerful
in his own confused way.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.480
So he's a cartogromancer.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.900
He has sort of mapmaking magic.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:02.620
And that is driven to a
large extent by a really

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:05.650
exquisite sixth sense,
a sense of position

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:08.520
or distance between
things that he has.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.610
And that is so
overwhelming to him,

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:13.750
that that's sort of the only
thing he's aware of at times.

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:16.300
So somebody is asking him a
question from two feet away,

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:19.500
but he's like, let's see,
there's a stone under my floor.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.460
And that's 2 and 1/2 feet away.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.590
And it's 600 million years old.

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:28.100
And it's a piece of slate.

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.070
Like, hey, can you sign?

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:32.090
Can you sign the form, please?

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:33.610
What?

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:35.440
So that's him.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.802
No, not based on any one person.

00:24:37.802 --> 00:24:39.760
ERIN SODERBERG: And I
have a follow-up question

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.634
about Dean Murchison.

00:24:40.634 --> 00:24:42.190
So as you pointed
out, sometimes, he

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:45.670
seems to have difficulty being
pulled into the real world

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.400
that he's actually living in.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:51.760
And some of what he says strikes
true, gets right to the point.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.190
And other times, he seems
to be speaking in riddles.

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:56.110
Should I, as a
reader, spend time

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:59.870
trying to make meaning out
of those parts of his speech?

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:04.330
TOM MILLER: So, he's sort of the
opposite of the usual Cassandra

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:08.020
paradox, which, if I
remember the story right,

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:13.455
was a soothsayer prophet
in Greek mythology.

00:25:13.455 --> 00:25:14.830
She could see the
future, but she

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:17.740
was cursed when she got
the gift of foresight,

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.690
that no one would
believe what she said.

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:22.840
Everybody knows that
Murchison's predictions

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.680
are pretty accurate.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.640
But he's sort of cursed
with talking so obliquely,

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.880
that even though they know
what he's saying is important,

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:35.750
or even if Robert is eventually
able to get to that point.

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:39.100
So, yes, what he says
is important or accurate

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:41.900
or with foreknowledge.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:45.100
But I don't know I would
spend too much time

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.797
trying to puzzle it out.

00:25:46.797 --> 00:25:48.130
It will become clear in the end.

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:50.350
ERIN SODERBERG: OK,
that's good to know.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:53.410
So, one of the parts
of your history

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:55.150
is that you studied at Harvard.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:57.430
And the novel takes
place in Boston.

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:59.560
And I'm wondering
how much of what

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:03.230
you wrote here was influenced
by your own experiences there?

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:07.900
TOM MILLER: So, I
started there at in 1999.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.113
And so, one of the interesting
historical curiosities

00:26:10.113 --> 00:26:15.100
is, I believe, up until
1972, Harvard was all men.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:19.960
So they did not become co-ed
until probably about 27 years

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.790
or so before I started there.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.920
There were still
faculty who remembered

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.320
that time and sort
of remembered how

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.870
badly a lot of the women
at that time were treated.

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:32.110
And sort of in a
counter revealing way,

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:35.300
there were certain
of my classmates

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.620
whose fathers and
grandfathers had gone there.

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:41.410
I didn't know anybody who'd
gone there before I went there.

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:46.630
But within a generation or
two, my classmates sort of

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:50.080
had this nostalgia for
a time when it was--

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.060
not that they'd ever
been there at the time.

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:55.090
But the sort of familial
nostalgia for it

00:26:55.090 --> 00:27:00.070
in a way that it felt
was really strange.

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:03.910
It's not 1979, It's 1999.

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:08.120
How can we possibly still
be having that conversation?

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:11.726
ERIN SODERBERG: So, a follow-up
question about Harvard.

00:27:11.726 --> 00:27:13.100
Are the Cocks and
Hens-- which is

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:17.410
a secret society in this novel--
based on a real secret society

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:18.550
at Harvard?

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:22.120
And did you participate in one?

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.480
TOM MILLER: I was not a
secret society sort of guy.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.430
I was in an improv
comedy group who--

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:31.250
when I sort of auditioned
and was successful--

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:35.920
they came to my dorm
room sort of dressed

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.930
in dark coats and
sunglasses like they

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:39.950
were the mafia or something.

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:42.619
And then, we went
out and had pizza.

00:27:42.619 --> 00:27:43.660
And it was a silly thing.

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.190
But there is this
split second where

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:47.650
I'm like, what have
I gotten myself--

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:49.460
it's a funny thing.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.780
So a tiny bit based on that.

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:55.590
My wife, who I also met
while I was in college--

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:59.370
was in the Radcliffe
choral society.

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:01.690
Harvard and Radcliffe
had merged by that point.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:04.000
But some of the old
names still remained.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.772
So they actually came and
very sweetly sang outside

00:28:07.772 --> 00:28:09.480
of the window, and
they gave you a flower

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.380
and went out for pizza.

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:16.757
So I'm somewhere, I guess,
on average between those.

00:28:16.757 --> 00:28:18.340
ERIN SODERBERG: Is
there anything else

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:22.180
from your personal history
that you drew from a lot

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:23.770
when writing?

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:26.320
TOM MILLER: So I would say
my time in EMS in particular.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.870
I was an EMT basic
in the Pittsburgh

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:30.400
area for about four years.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:34.270
So if you called 911
after about 150 hours

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:36.580
at the Community College
of Allegheny County,

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:39.100
I was the guy who pulled
up in the ambulance.

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.846
Particularly, that idea of not
knowing what you're going into,

00:28:41.846 --> 00:28:44.470
or having a pretty good idea of
what you're going into and then

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:47.530
being completely wrong.

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:50.680
So that informed sort
of the opening rescue

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.970
sequence a little bit.

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:55.540
Later on, as Robert is trying
to get into a burning building

00:28:55.540 --> 00:29:00.100
to save somebody, and
one thing goes wrong

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.340
and then things start
spiraling out of control,

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:06.400
I would say that is not
based on any one thing

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:10.420
that I did, but sort of
under those high stress

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:14.360
situations as things
begin going wrong,

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:17.380
or as you try to fix
a problem by creating

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.420
an even bigger problem.

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.522
Some of that has
filtered into it.

00:29:22.522 --> 00:29:23.980
ERIN SODERBERG: So
there's a mantra

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:26.410
in the book that gets
repeated several times, which

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:28.420
is try less hard.

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:29.770
Where did that come from?

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:33.070
And do you find it useful in
your own life as a writer,

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:33.872
or as a doctor?

00:29:33.872 --> 00:29:35.830
TOM MILLER: That's maybe
something I aspire to,

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:42.280
but I can't claim to put it into
use as much as I would like.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.620
That's in part
based on my college

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:47.450
roommate who was a rower, and
was a better rower than I was.

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:50.620
But our dorm had one of
the eight man crew shells

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:54.460
that we rowed on, like
intramural rowing.

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.240
So we rowed against
the other dorms.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.710
So he sat directly behind me.

00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:59.210
I was not a great rower.

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:02.350
I was accused of trying to
stroke the boat from the number

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:02.860
six seat.

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:05.420
You all have to move at
exactly the same time.

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:07.330
So if there's one
person who has sort

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:09.280
of independent ideas
about how fast he'd

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.810
like to be rowing, that is out
of sync with everybody else,

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:13.960
that's a big problem.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.630
So he would be sitting
behind me going,

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:20.140
relax, relax, in sort
of the same fashion.

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:24.400
So I sort of thought of
him as I wrote that line.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:29.320
But sort of that idea of
making things look easy

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.810
or some of the greatest
competence being

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:34.954
able to do sort of high pressure
things in a relaxed way,

00:30:34.954 --> 00:30:36.370
certainly, is
applicable to what I

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:38.770
do in medicine, though
I am a long way off most

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:42.116
days, from getting there.

00:30:42.116 --> 00:30:43.990
ERIN SODERBERG: So many
of my fellow Googlers

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:47.734
also pursue various artistic
pursuits in their free time.

00:30:47.734 --> 00:30:49.150
What advice do you
have for people

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:50.890
whose full time
profession like yours

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:52.780
is something other than
writing, but who wish

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:54.250
to write a novel themselves?

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:57.070
TOM MILLER: So if taking two
years off from your main career

00:30:57.070 --> 00:31:00.730
is not an option, what I'd
done for a long time was

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:03.400
sort of block out space
every day to write.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.900
And that was the
one piece of advice

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:08.530
I'd probably gotten a dozen or
100 times in my life, which,

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:10.000
if you want to get
good at writing,

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.420
you have to do it every day.

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:14.530
If you want to finish a project,
you have to do it every day.

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:17.530
And it took me a really long
time to take that to heart.

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:19.330
Went to grad school
for creative writing.

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:23.095
I certainly was writing every
day when I had the time,

00:31:23.095 --> 00:31:26.080
or when that was
my full time job.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.540
But as things got
rolling in the book,

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:31.960
I hit a point where it was
sort of like a self-sustaining

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.320
reaction almost, where it
got easier instead of harder,

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.540
and were the habit of
writing every day--

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:42.190
even if it was just for 15
or 20 minutes before bed--

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:46.870
became easier to
do than not to do.

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:49.390
And the other
advice I've heard is

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:52.930
if you can write one page a
day, by the end of the year,

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:55.814
you'll have a novel's
worth of pages.

00:31:55.814 --> 00:31:57.730
Whether it's any good
or not, whether you then

00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:02.380
spend seven years revising
it, is a different question.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.620
But write every day if you're
trying to write a novel.

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.330
ERIN SODERBERG:
So, another thing

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:09.640
that definitely
strikes me as I read

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.260
this particular novel
is that it would

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:13.774
translate very well as a movie.

00:32:13.774 --> 00:32:15.190
Many of the scenes
are very visual

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:17.510
and you can picture
exactly what's happening.

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:19.180
So is that going to happen?

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:20.530
I hope it happens.

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:22.821
TOM MILLER: There's been a
little bit of talk about it,

00:32:22.821 --> 00:32:24.989
but nothing concrete.

00:32:24.989 --> 00:32:26.780
ERIN SODERBERG: And if
that were to happen,

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:28.750
do you have any
particular actors in mind

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:29.980
for any of the main roles?

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:31.480
TOM MILLER: So, none of
the characters in the book

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.860
are supposed to be very good--

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.860
maybe with the exception of Jake
and Mayweather-- none of them

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:37.630
are supposed to be
very good looking.

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:41.920
So I imagine Robert as
sort of a young less good

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.249
looking Vin Diesel with hair.

00:32:43.249 --> 00:32:44.290
ERIN SODERBERG: Oh, sure.

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:47.290
Yeah, I can picture that.

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:48.520
What about Danielle?

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:52.780
TOM MILLER: I have not yet
seen the right person for her.

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.140
I don't know.

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.540
Who do you see as Danielle?

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:57.165
ERIN SODERBERG: That's
a good question.

00:32:57.165 --> 00:32:58.990
I'm also not sure.

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:02.040
I'll have to think about
that and get back to you.

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.550
So that was the
last question I had.

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:05.008
I'm going to open
it up now and see

00:33:05.008 --> 00:33:07.890
if anyone else has any
questions they'd like to ask.

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:11.602
And if you ask, I can repeat
it so that you can hear.

00:33:11.602 --> 00:33:13.679
AUDIENCE: I have two questions.

00:33:13.679 --> 00:33:15.220
I think my first
question is, so when

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:19.720
I read the synopsis
of your book,

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.330
I decided to come to this.

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:24.300
Two of my favorite
trilogies-- like,

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.220
fantasy trilogies of all
time-- are "His Dark Materials"

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:30.860
by Philip Pullman, and
the Abhorsen trilogy,

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:32.695
which is like
"Sabriel," "Lirael".

00:33:32.695 --> 00:33:35.560
And the reason I bring that up
is because both of those books

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.106
are kind of set in these--

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:41.890
it's kind of this
historical setting,

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:44.470
but things went in a
different direction.

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:48.260
In the case of "Sabriel" and
"Lirael," it's like it's magic,

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.570
but they don't call it magic.

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:50.810
And they do different things.

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:53.790
And I guess I was wondering if
you had other books that you

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:57.670
kind of drew inspiration from
for such a creative scene.

00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:02.050
TOM MILLER: Yeah, I encountered
both of those series relatively

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:03.640
late in my life.

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.500
So Philip Pullman
probably was when

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.330
I was a junior or
senior in college

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:10.480
that I read those
for the first time.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.280
I've read "Sabriel",
which has bell ringing

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.449
magic, essentially, which
is not like anything I've

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:17.530
seen elsewhere.

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:19.840
It was really striking to me.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:23.409
And it was an instance to
me of a male writer writing

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:27.760
a teenage sort of late
teens, young woman

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.679
character in a pretty good way.

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:33.100
I thought Garth Nix, to my
eye, or to my ear, at least,

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.739
did a nice job with it.

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:38.320
The two books or two
series, I would say,

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.060
most directly
influenced this one.

00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:42.489
One would be "Jonathan
Strange and Mr. Norrell"

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:46.144
which was a historical fantasy
novel set in the Napoleonic

00:34:46.144 --> 00:34:46.644
Wars.

00:34:46.644 --> 00:34:50.710
It was written in about 2004,
I think, by Susannah Clark.

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:52.840
Much more high-minded,
much more sort

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.030
of literary in what it
tried to do, particularly

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:56.980
in terms of the
prose style, where

00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:59.830
I was trying to write something
a little bit planar, both

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:01.630
because I thought
it would be more

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:04.900
accessible, and ultimately,
because that was

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:07.780
the voice of that character
was a sort of plainspoken sort

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:10.600
of simple-spoken westerner.

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.006
The other series that
came to mind to me a lot

00:35:13.006 --> 00:35:15.130
as I was trying to figure
out how to write the book

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:17.110
and structure the
book was one that I

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:20.950
had read sort of probably
in my mid-teens, which

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:24.340
was the "Farseer"
trilogy by Robin Hobb.

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.130
Structurally, it used--
and I've seen it elsewhere.

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:28.400
It's in "Ender's Game."

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:33.280
It's in "Starship Troopers,"
but the idea of somebody

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.370
looking back from
middle age reflecting

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:39.520
on more youthful adventures,
so little bit of that narrative

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.950
distance which was
useful, and then starting

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:47.860
each of the chapters with
an epigram or a piece

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:50.650
of that world to help
with world building

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:53.290
in a way that doesn't
necessarily muck up the plot

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:55.260
or slow things down.

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.850
And people can read it or
puzzle over those things,

00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:01.949
or not, as they choose.

00:36:01.949 --> 00:36:04.490
AUDIENCE: And then, my second
question is sort of a follow-up

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:09.370
to your first question about
I've played around the idea

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:11.300
of writing a book for
a very long time--

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:12.640
very, very, very long time.

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.620
And I've written short stories.

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:17.630
But I'm not consistent.

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:19.660
I guess, one question
I have for you

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:22.256
is, did you have a
moment where you're

00:36:22.256 --> 00:36:23.380
doing all this other stuff.

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:25.338
You've clearly been to
grad school a few times.

00:36:25.338 --> 00:36:29.890
So have I. Did you ever
just wake up one day

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:31.944
and just decide,
I need to focus.

00:36:31.944 --> 00:36:32.735
I have a good idea.

00:36:32.735 --> 00:36:33.800
I need to focus on this.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.056
I really need to kind of start?

00:36:36.056 --> 00:36:38.980
TOM MILLER: It was my New Year's
resolution for 2010, was I

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:40.850
was going to write every day.

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:42.330
I think I kept it with--

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:46.100
I maybe missed two days
or so over the following

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:49.730
six or seven years.

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:50.844
So, yes, there was a day.

00:36:50.844 --> 00:36:52.760
And then, once I decided
I was going to do it,

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:53.820
but it was like--

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.490
I don't know-- October,
November of '09.

00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:58.400
I'm like, well, I might
as well start now.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.410
Part of that was
the time pressure

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:03.340
because I started
medical school in 2010.

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:05.840
I'm working I'm working a couple
of different jobs part time

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:06.339
right now.

00:37:06.339 --> 00:37:10.280
I have time, particularly, as
I sort of taper down and get

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.630
set to start school again.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.150
So this is the time to do it.

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:15.890
And if I don't
get a lot of pages

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:18.980
down, if I don't get a
rough draft together now,

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:21.510
it's probably never
going to happen.

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:22.820
So I may as well try.

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.472
AUDIENCE: And was it always
kind of this book in particular

00:37:25.472 --> 00:37:26.180
you were writing?

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:27.980
Or were you kind of playing
around with other ideas?

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.479
TOM MILLER: I played around
with many things over the years.

00:37:30.479 --> 00:37:33.052
But this is one of the
things I keep coming back to.

00:37:33.052 --> 00:37:34.760
And the first sketches
they did toward it

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:38.390
were probably as early as 2004.

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:40.710
I was a travel
writer at that time.

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:43.160
I was down in New
Zealand doing a couple

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:45.900
of the great walks, which
were these multi-day hikes.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.910
I was doing it quite
late in the year,

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:50.810
so there were not a lot of
other people out on the trails.

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:52.270
And I kept getting lost.

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:56.276
So that's sort of where the
mapmaking magic came from.

00:37:56.276 --> 00:37:57.900
But I found it a
really appealing world

00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.816
and an appealing idea.

00:37:58.816 --> 00:38:01.130
I kept coming back to it,
would write a few pages,

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:04.100
and then set it aside
for months or years.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:06.380
One danger of that
approach, I think,

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.210
is that you can
know too well what

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:12.140
you want to do or be too
unwilling to discard things.

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:16.440
So ultimately, in the revising,
which took the longest time,

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.320
it was trying to
streamline things

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.690
and trying to drop a
little bit of the things

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:23.194
that I've been doing,
just because, well, that's

00:38:23.194 --> 00:38:24.110
how I'd been doing it.

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:25.490
But does it make sense?

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:27.662
Or is it useful to the story?

00:38:27.662 --> 00:38:29.870
And that's something I had
to figure out in revising,

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:31.550
rather than primary writing.

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:37.150
ERIN SODERBERG:
All right, I think

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:38.621
that brings us to a conclusion.

00:38:38.621 --> 00:38:40.870
Thank you so much, Tom, for
visiting us and telling us

00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:42.470
all about "The
Philosopher's Flight."

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:44.594
TOM MILLER: Well, Erin,
thanks for having me today.

00:38:44.594 --> 00:38:50.110
And thanks to our tech crew too,
who were laboring quite a bit.

00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:51.882
When nice and smooth.

00:38:51.882 --> 00:38:52.840
ERIN SODERBERG: Thanks.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:56.190
