We've already seen a lot of logarithms used in this lesson and we're only going

00:00:03.405 --> 00:00:07.536
to keep using them more. So I think it's time that you learn how to use

00:00:07.536 --> 00:00:11.710
mathquill to write logs in a pretty way. Now they should be pretty similar to

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.030
some other functions you've seen written in mathquill. And of course you'll get

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.987
plenty of practice using this. Let's say for example that I want to write log

00:00:18.987 --> 00:00:23.805
base 4 of x. Well, in mathquill here is what I would type in, \ log, then the

00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:28.227
spacebar, then to get down into this subscript space where the four is written,

00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:35.340
need to press Shift and then hold it down while you type the Minus sign key.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.266
That's what's going to shift you down here. Then you can write a little four

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:43.640
just to the bottom right of the log. To get out of the space and get back to

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.760
where we're going to write the input for the log press the Arrow key to the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.088
right. You could also press Tab instead then take your input which in this case

00:00:52.088 --> 00:00:55.590
is x. Now since you've seen one example I think it would make sense for you to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.974
try one yourself. How would you type log base 3 of x plus 4 in mathquill. In

00:01:01.974 --> 00:01:05.926
the box that appears down here. Try it out. You should be able to tell based on

00:01:05.926 --> 00:01:10.235
how it looks, whether or not it's going to be right. You could also use the box

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:13.205
down here to try out writing some other log expressions, anything you can think

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:14.340
of.
