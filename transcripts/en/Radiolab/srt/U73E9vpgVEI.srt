1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,780
Hey, this is Radiolab. I'm Jad
Abumrad. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:08,050
The topic is totally tumor. Of course.
It's my line by the way. Oh No. Yeah,

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,170
yeah. We've been talking
about tumors. This,

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,550
our famous tumors and thus far they've
been really bad. Heritable tumor,

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,350
any bad Geary, horrible tumors.

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,700
But because we are fair-minded
about everything, even tumors,

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,720
let us consider the possibility
that sometimes tumors can be rich,

8
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,430
beautiful and desirable. For example.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,453
Well,

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,760
George Malley is an ordinary man who is
about to become extraordinary name as

11
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:39,180
many mammals as you can in 60 seconds.
How about Alphabetic r Brock, Batman,

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,440
Caribou, Dauphine, OHIP hip.

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,280
This what is going on in this 1996 movie,

14
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:48,120
John Travolta plays a guy. If it
gets a brain tumor and a tumor,

15
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:50,710
the performance makes him
into a genius are quests of

16
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,610
[inaudible] Portuguese language in 20
minutes. Not all of it. Phenomenon.

17
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:03,250
Learn the accent though too,
where it doesn't give accents,

18
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:07,950
but, but it does. It does raise a
feel question, which is like can't,

19
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,830
is it possible for a tumor
to create something good?

20
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,720
So we paid a visit to a guy,
a doctor named Orrin Devinsky.

21
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,270
I'm a neurologist at NYU
Langone school of Medicine

22
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:25,000
and Dr Divinsky has had a
lifelong interest in the
beneficial effects of certain

23
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,110
kinds of brain conditions. Right?

24
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,650
Yeah. I'll just tell you,

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,580
I think one of the most fascinating
cases in neurology very quickly,

26
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,790
and this one we were not prepared for.

27
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,810
A gentleman was described who ever since
he was a child would look at safety

28
00:01:38,811 --> 00:01:43,460
pins and have an orgasm at
safety pins at safety pins.

29
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,490
The more shiny and the more
numerous, the safety pin,

30
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:50,840
the stronger the sexual experience. And
this happened from his pubescent period.

31
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,790
He just safety pins and try them
on. Right. If you were pretty,

32
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:56,480
he made this association when you looked
at a safety pin, he had an orgasm,

33
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,320
so he got to have been embarrassed by
this. This is worse than being so yeah.

34
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:03,800
So he would go into pride. He realized
this is not something most people do.

35
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:08,510
He never talked about it and he did it
in private and then he got married after

36
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:08,901
the war.

37
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:13,250
He was honorably discharged and got
married and then started having less sex

38
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:16,370
with his wife because the safety pin
was much safety pins were much more

39
00:02:16,371 --> 00:02:18,650
enjoyable. Sometimes you just
had to think about a safety pin,

40
00:02:18,651 --> 00:02:20,090
not even hold it up.

41
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:21,930
So wait,

42
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,560
where are we seriously making the case
that this guy is getting a benefit from

43
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,240
furiously pin obsession.

44
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:30,900
But I think actually you could say that
the experiences that this guy was having

45
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:35,250
with those safety pins gave them a kind
of pleasure that maybe is unavailable to

46
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:38,550
the rest of us from an odd,
odd source, but you know,

47
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,430
pleasures pleasure until says Devinsky.

48
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,860
This fellow began to have seizures,

49
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,750
got admitted to a psychiatric
hospital in London, the Mozley,

50
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:49,810
one of the big psychiatric
units. They actually got an EEG.

51
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,960
And to make a long story short,
there was a benign tumor.

52
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,560
Oh, right in the part that's
called the temporal lobe,

53
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:57,660
sort of in the middle of your
head, right behind your eyes.

54
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,030
But they took it out. They
took it out, they took it out,

55
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,470
and they cured him of
his wonderful experience.

56
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,120
So he, uh, he never was able to, he
could look at safety pins all day long,

57
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:14,380
but he would never again enjoy them
the way he had for his whole life.

58
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,220
How did he feel about that? Um,

59
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,780
I think it was a mixed
blessing as you would imagine.

60
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,100
[inaudible]

61
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,250
well,

62
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,250
I've got blue jeans on sneakers and this
idea that from a tune where you can get

63
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:34,170
something in the not so good, but also
something good. This is an idea that has,

64
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,200
well, there has been a, a
novel written on this theme.

65
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,200
The title of the book is lying
awake by a friend of mine.

66
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:41,700
My name is Mark Salzman.

67
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,510
Mark is a writer who lives out
in California and he thought,

68
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,310
I'm going to imagine a nun, our main
characters, sister John of the cross.

69
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,520
This is a woman who had joined a nunnery
because she felt just lonely for a

70
00:03:56,911 --> 00:03:57,990
relationship with God.

71
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,330
Yes. It's just not enough for her
to tell herself. Yes, God is there.

72
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:07,310
What she longs for is a tangible
sense of God's presence,

73
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,620
a sense that she can really feel
God's presence in her life. And,

74
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,310
um, she,

75
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:19,100
she begins having what she thinks are
migraine headaches that the regular doctor

76
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:22,970
that the sisters see tells her that she
seems to be having migraine headaches.

77
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:27,971
They're coming more and more frequently
and there comes a point when one of

78
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:31,880
these headaches changes dramatically
and then everything is different.

79
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,320
Everything is different. What's different?
Well, what happens? Shall I read?

80
00:04:36,321 --> 00:04:41,210
Yeah, go ahead. Yeah. You kind of have
to imagine this scene taking place in,

81
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,460
uh, an environment of profound silence.

82
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:44,760
Okay.

83
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,180
She's in the cloister.
She and one other sister,

84
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,930
they're working on a sewing project.
They're sewing an altar cloth.

85
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,750
One of the pins slipped out of her hand

86
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,280
ringing like a miniature triangle
is it bounced off the floor.

87
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,210
She looked down to the floor and saw that
it looked impossibly distant when she

88
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:08,320
reached down for the pin,

89
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,220
her hand look strangest of all as
if it belonged to someone else.

90
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,460
The silence in the room came alive
like the words left out of a poem.

91
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:25,650
[inaudible]

92
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,450
something buried. So deep insider,

93
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,560
but she'd forgotten it was there
rose to the surface sister,

94
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,670
are you not feeling well?

95
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,220
God was present and sister and
his voice was present in her face.

96
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,930
Nothing was changed yet everything was
changed. God is here. She answered,

97
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,870
you were here all along.

98
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,890
Well this is a field goal isn't it?

99
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:56,930
For someone seeking a spiritual
connection. She has one.

100
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,400
That's right. She was. This is the moment
she's been waiting for all her life.

101
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:04,890
But there is a problem because
when these things come in,

102
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,610
sorry can we you she has a tumor.

103
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:11,240
Let's just get the non surprise out of
the way. The show is called totally tumor

104
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,300
famous tumors. Okay. Yes.
She has a meningioma,

105
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,290
a benign tumor,

106
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,160
small about the size of a raisin in
the temporal lobe area of her brain.

107
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,920
Right in the same spot where the
safety pin fellow had his tumor.

108
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:29,810
So the problem for her is
should I have the tumor removed,

109
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,990
give up the most satisfying and fulfilling
experience of my whole life or should

110
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:41,330
I sacrifice my health in order to share
with others the experiences that I'm

111
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:46,150
having. So we thought, well our
Devinsky the doctor we spoke with first.

112
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,850
I think every case is unique and
individual. See patients like this.

113
00:06:49,851 --> 00:06:52,700
This is what he does for that.
So we took the case to him.

114
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,570
Now here's the question.
If a person comes and says,

115
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,180
I'm having what I want

116
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,220
and you are suspicious that what
she also is having is a disease,

117
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,340
what do you do about the patient?

118
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:12,430
If I knew for sure that the tumor, let's
say was benign and would never grow,

119
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,570
and the only thing that person experienced
was this religious feeling that

120
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,670
they've found extremely enjoyable,

121
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,170
I would say let's do nothing but do
serial scans to make sure nothing grows in

122
00:07:23,171 --> 00:07:24,004
that you're safe.

123
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,880
But in the book, as it happens, the nun
got a little worse. She had a few more

124
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:31,850
headaches, the more severe,
and they took the tumor out,

125
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,650
the seizure activity stops

126
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:36,630
[inaudible]

127
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,100
these experiences stopped coming

128
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:40,640
[inaudible]

129
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,930
and she does feel
afterwards a sense of Blah

130
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,090
[inaudible]

131
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,980
she feels as if she sort of tumbled out
of a Himalayan mountain into a muddy

132
00:07:51,981 --> 00:07:52,814
village.

133
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:54,940
[inaudible]

134
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,880
this is common apparently in patients
after they've been treated. Right.

135
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,550
So my last question then
is really about the,

136
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,540
it seems to me the deepest question
though. All on this case is that, um,

137
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,560
if someone has a very important
and meaningful experience
and you have a sense,

138
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,650
it may be a abnormality, a physical
abnormality that is triggering them,

139
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,520
do you regard them as delusional?

140
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:26,440
Like there's just the possibility here
that maybe these people are having an

141
00:08:26,441 --> 00:08:27,760
actual conversation. So

142
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,090
yeah, there's no question. Are you
not even considered that? No, I mean,

143
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:35,110
so side I think the question you asked
and I think you're getting at is could it

144
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:39,570
truly be that this is God's
Evan knew to speak to us, um,

145
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,180
and people in the late 18 hundreds thought
it was through the right hemisphere.

146
00:08:43,181 --> 00:08:45,700
And that's often where these cases
occur in the right hemisphere.

147
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:48,100
So it may be that that's right.

148
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:52,690
It's the more emotional hemisphere and
when things are in a perturbed state,

149
00:08:52,691 --> 00:08:57,691
you may be more receptive to
experiencing spiritual things.

150
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:03,450
And I think there probably is some
physiologic basis that allows you to tune

151
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:08,451
into a broader world and maybe some
states of neurologic dysfunction allow you

152
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:12,780
to harmonize or tune in or receive
those messages so to speak.

153
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,840
In which case then your tumor or your
epilepsy would be the window or the

154
00:09:18,481 --> 00:09:22,440
conduit. Right. I do feel like I
need to place an asterix right here,

155
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,940
like we are talking about
a tumor in the end. Well,

156
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,270
but understand that every feeling,

157
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:31,920
every thought you have comes
from cells in your brain.

158
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,610
Yeah.

159
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,260
Any of those cells can produce a glorious
experience than the experienced stands

160
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,460
on its own and sometimes in
very well documented cases.

161
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,390
These are extraordinarily profound,

162
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,010
desirable thing. They're often hard to
put into words. Have you tried, I mean,

163
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,630
when you, I mean people,
you know Destro Yefsky,

164
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,600
he's probably the most articulate person
with epilepsy who's had a religious

165
00:09:57,601 --> 00:10:00,690
experience and who wrote
down what he experienced.

166
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,860
I don't have the quote in front of me,
but it's, you know, this Felicity, this,

167
00:10:04,861 --> 00:10:06,510
this a feeling I get

168
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,100
for several moments he was quoted to
say that I would experience such joy as

169
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:13,620
would be inconceivable in ordinary life.

170
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,330
I would feel the most complete harmony
in myself and in the whole world.

171
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,000
And this feeling was so strong and sweet

172
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,650
that for a few seconds of
such bliss, I would give

173
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,170
[inaudible]

174
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,330
10 or more years of my life

175
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:30,620
[inaudible]

176
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,030
even my whole life.

177
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:35,933
[inaudible]

178
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:40,910
hi.
