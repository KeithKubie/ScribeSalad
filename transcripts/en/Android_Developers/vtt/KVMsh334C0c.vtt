NATHAN MARTZ: I'm Nathan.

00:00:01.041 --> 00:00:03.590
I'm the lead product
manager for developers

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.062
on Tango and Daydream.

00:00:06.062 --> 00:00:08.020
And today, I get to talk
to you about something

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.530
that is super awesome--
at least I think it is--

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.460
and that is immersive computing.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.610
Immersive computing is a family
of very related technologies

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.190
that we believe is
going to revolutionize

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.530
how people interact
with information

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.510
and experience the world.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:29.500
With VR, we could actually
take people from the world

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.219
that they live in-- there we go.

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.510
We can actually take people
from the world they live in

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.070
into unfamiliar new worlds.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.430
We can make them feel physically
present in new places,

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.660
both real and imaginary.

00:00:45.971 --> 00:00:49.090
With AR, we can actually
bring the world of information

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.260
into our own.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.230
We can enhance with
information and interactivity

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.970
the actual objects
and environments

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.860
we find ourselves in.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.370
Both of these together are
incredibly powerful ways

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.050
of enhancing and
expanding the way

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.424
that we interact with the world.

00:01:03.424 --> 00:01:04.840
And of course, at
Google, we think

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.620
this is amazing, because our
mission is about interactivity

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.850
and about information.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.190
We think about our mission
statement-- organizing

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.950
the world's information,
making it universally

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.420
accessible and useful.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.570
And that's why when
we think about VR

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.400
and AR and immersive
computing, we

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.770
know that VR is going
to make our ability

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.340
to be surrounded by it, to
access information incredibly

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.587
more immersive.

00:01:28.587 --> 00:01:30.670
And AR is going to make
the information that we're

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.590
surrounded by--
sensors from our phones

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.220
and from the internet of things,
from the data sources that we

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.500
have about our
products and our users,

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.480
and the physical objects
that surround us--

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.130
and make all of that
dramatically more

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.390
useful and interactive.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.069
At Google, we also think a
lot, I think, about scale,

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.860
like all of you do.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.410
We want to maximize our
reach and our impact.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.210
And we believe
that fundamentally,

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.920
scale and immersive
computing is going

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.010
to come from mobile
computing form factors.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.150
So already today,
there's no surprise,

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.480
there's billions
more smartphones

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.160
in the world than PCs.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.490
People have spoken, and they
say the future is mobile.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.990
And so what you'll
see is everything

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.970
that we're doing around
immersive computing

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.000
will be built around
mobile form factors.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.590
So today, I'm going
to talk to you

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.290
about two platforms, two
products specifically,

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.260
the first of which is
Daydream, our platform

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.440
for mobile virtual
reality, and Tango

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.160
for mobile augmented reality.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.230
And I think this is a
great time, actually,

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.660
to be doing immersive
computing work,

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.000
because this stuff is
finally becoming real.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.286
Just a few weeks ago,
we launched the Pixel,

00:02:36.286 --> 00:02:37.660
which is the first
Daydream Ready

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.243
phone in the world,
the first one that

00:02:39.243 --> 00:02:43.510
embodies our vision for what's
possible in VR on your phone.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.980
And just a couple
of days ago, Lenovo

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.480
released the Phab 2 Pro,
which is the very first

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.850
Tango-ready phone in the world.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.890
So this technology
is not theoretical.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:54.970
It's not abstract.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.730
You can go to a Best
Buy or the Google store

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.890
and get these devices
now and actually

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.050
experience for yourself
virtual reality

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.230
and augmented reality
available on your phone.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.862
So we'll dive into both of
these platforms in a little more

00:03:07.862 --> 00:03:09.820
detail so that you can
understand the specifics

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.320
and the opportunities.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.010
With Daydream, we're talking
about virtual reality.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.900
And the challenge
with VR is you're

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.300
creating a sense of
presence for the user.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.590
That requires you to have
hardware and software that work

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.755
perfectly with one another.

00:03:24.755 --> 00:03:27.130
When somebody takes their
phone and puts it in the viewer

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.630
and straps it on
their head, you're

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.010
teleporting them somewhere else.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.770
You're creating a
synthetic sense of reality.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.560
And when it's flawless,
it's transformative.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.140
And when it's not, it's
often not that awesome.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.090
And so we've been
working very carefully

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.770
to design the hardware, the
Pixel phone, and the viewer,

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.660
and all the software,
like Android N,

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.330
to work well to
be perfect for VR.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.850
And for months and
months, my team

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.480
has been obsessing over the
details of these platforms,

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.790
making sure that the
phones are actually

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.402
ready to deliver amazing VR
experiences, that our viewer is

00:04:01.402 --> 00:04:03.610
lightweight and comfortable,
that it has a controller

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.590
that you can interact with.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.180
But for us, we think
it's honestly not

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.670
good enough to build
something that's great.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.230
We want as many
people in the world

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.247
to experience VR as possible.

00:04:13.247 --> 00:04:14.830
And so we've done
the really hard work

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.310
to actually make the viewer and
controller available for a very

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.959
affordable price point.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.519
And also, they're sold together.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.000
So as a developer, you can
know exactly what input

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.220
every single Daydream
user is going to have

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.609
when they launch your app.

00:04:28.609 --> 00:04:30.400
We know that fragmentation
is a big concern

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.870
for a lot of
developers, and we're

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.380
making sure that that's
not a problem on Daydream.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.600
Also, of course, like I
said, this stuff really

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.520
matters when it's real,
when you go to a store

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.520
and buy it and take it home
and experience it for yourself.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.044
And Daydream View
is actually going

00:04:44.044 --> 00:04:46.210
to be available in stores
in just a few days, a week

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.810
from today, on November 10,
which is also super, super

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.240
exciting.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.020
So the foundation of Daydream
is, of course, the phone.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.540
All the sensors are in the phone
that you use for the device.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.140
But Daydream is not about a
specific phone like the Pixel

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.946
or only phones made by Google.

00:05:05.946 --> 00:05:07.320
Like I said, we
believe in scale,

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.880
and scale is going
to mean the way

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.950
that Android does it, which is
do partnerships and other OEMs.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.210
And so it's actually a
standard called Daydream ready.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.830
And the Daydream-ready
certification

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.620
is something that we actually
work directly with OEMs

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.500
to make sure that every phone
that's tagged Daydream-ready

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.486
is actually going
to be great for VR.

00:05:24.486 --> 00:05:25.860
That means things
like certifying

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.210
that there's low persistence
displays, high compute SOCs,

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.240
and accurate low latency
sensors on the device.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.710
This way, as a
developer, you know

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.687
that every Daydream-ready phone
will run your app really well.

00:05:37.687 --> 00:05:39.270
And for consumers,
they know that when

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.820
they buy a Daydream-ready
phone, the entire catalog

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.800
is going to work great on it.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.600
Also, every
Daydream-ready phone is

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.330
running Android N, which is
our first version of Android

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.406
actually optimized
to be great at VR.

00:05:50.406 --> 00:05:52.530
And we've done some really
fundamental innovations.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.613
We've done things like
Sustained Performance Mode.

00:05:54.613 --> 00:05:58.050
So we actually manage
the SOC inside the phone.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.080
We basically have different
power management in VR

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.020
to balance performance
and run time.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.060
We've got very
sophisticated head tracking

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.940
that fuses all of the sensors
on the device to figure out

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.570
where you're looking
in space very,

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.990
very accurately and
at very low latency.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.000
But of course, it's
still your phone.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.980
And sometimes, you
get notifications.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.240
You get phone calls.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.740
And so we've taken core Android
System UI and made it VR aware.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.900
So if you get a call
while you're in VR,

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.840
you can actually stay in
VR and decide for yourself

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.180
whether you want to
answer that call or not.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.560
So the phone is great.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.600
But with just a
phone, it's not VR.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.530
It's a phone.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.410
And to be transformative,
we need a viewer

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.510
that lets you see
the world in 3D

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.790
and a controller that
lets you interact with it.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.820
And that's what Daydream
View is all about.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.560
On the viewer, it's
actually very simple.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.880
It's electronically inert, which
means that all of the smarts

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.380
are in the phone itself.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.410
And the job of the viewer is
to be as comfortable as humanly

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:56.430
possible.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.440
We've actually tried
to take a lot of cues

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.390
from apparel, from soft goods.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.210
If you look at a
lot of high tech VR,

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.360
they're inspired more by
gadgets, by DVD players

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.050
and consoles.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.170
But nobody wears
electronics on your body.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.840
Nobody wants to put a
DVD player on their face.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.270
So we try to think about
for a thing that you wear,

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.930
let's design it in the same
way, to be made of fabric,

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.660
soft and approachable.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.270
The controller looks
actually pretty simple,

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.030
but it's honestly
really expressive.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.920
And there's a
challenge in VR, which

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.117
is when you have
a controller, you

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:32.700
need to be able to
use it blindfolded.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.882
You're wearing a viewer.

00:07:33.882 --> 00:07:35.340
And so you need a
controller that's

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.020
both accessible for
users, that they

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.240
can operate without
looking at their hands,

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.280
but expressive for developers.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.230
And so we have a few
different surfaces.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.760
The key is a clickable touchpad.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.410
It's an analog touchpad that
supports touch and click

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:47.910
separately.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.620
There's an app button
that's up to you

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.627
to do whatever you want
with and a Home button

00:07:51.627 --> 00:07:53.460
that we reserve for key
actions, like taking

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.370
the user from your app
back to Daydream Home.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.760
Most critically, though,
this is a motion controller.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.060
It has a 9-axis IMU that can
give you very, very accurate 3D

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.290
orientation.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.745
And you can use that the way you
would a Wiimote on a console,

00:08:07.745 --> 00:08:09.870
actually give people a live
sense of hand presence.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.750
You can map virtual objects
to what the real controller is

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.810
doing, and people will feel
a very powerful connection

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.850
of how the virtual
world is connected

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.920
to their physical actions.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.930
So all of that is enough to
get you from the real world

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:26.310
into VR.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:29.870
But for us, the platform
is about-- it actually

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.100
has to extend past
that entry point.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.870
And we know that
for most of you,

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.570
you want to actually not
just make great software.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:37.690
You want to make a living.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:39.270
You have businesses to run.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.030
And so for us, we've been
very focused on both discovery

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.620
and monetization.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.380
The screen behind me here is
what's called Daydream Home.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.900
This is the first
place that every user

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.780
goes when they put their viewer
into the headset and step

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.040
into VR.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.160
The top three big tiles, they're
called discovery windows.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.550
They are surfaces where we
curate and expose the best

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.710
original content for Daydream.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.540
We know that early
adopters of VR

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.760
are going to be extremely
hungry for new content,

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.400
and we want to surface that
as often and as prominently

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.570
as possible.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.090
The cool thing is that we
actually can leverage deep

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.980
linking in these
discovery windows,

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.160
not just to promote new
apps, but new experiences

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.690
within existing apps.

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.700
So if you're building
a platform, a service,

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.950
and you have new content
coming in all the time,

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.800
we can actually service
that new content, not just

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.620
the launch of the
platform itself.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.550
So that's discovery.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.160
It helps get people
exposed to the best of what

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.390
we have to offer.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:35.520
But monetization is
really important as well.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.100
So we've brought, actually,
with the launch of Daydream,

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:42.360
the Play Store into VR so
users can browse for content,

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.750
check out collections,
buy apps, and install them

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:47.160
all without leaving VR.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.920
It's an incredibly
easy, low-friction way

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.240
for people to find new content.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.850
Of course, that's awesome,
but we know that many of you

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:58.590
have whole businesses
built on selling goods,

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.200
on transacting
within applications,

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.400
not selling premium
goods up front.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.250
And so we're actually
launching with in-app purchases

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:09.370
or in-app billing day and date
with the launch of Daydream.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:11.710
So whether you're a freemium
developer or a premium

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.420
developer or
somewhere in between,

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.910
you can bring your content
and your business model

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.430
into VR right out of the gate.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.740
And for me, this is
all super exciting.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.999
But nothing really speaks to
the power of the platform more

00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:27.040
than what developers are
already creating for it.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.110
So I think we'll check out a
video that shows exactly that.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.610
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:28.850
All right.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.309
Well, that gives you a sense
of what Daydream is all about.

00:11:31.309 --> 00:11:32.725
And now I'm going
to switch gears,

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:34.520
and I'm going to talk
about Tango, which is

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.280
our AR technology and platform.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.700
And where Daydream's core
technological challenge

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.500
and opportunity
for innovation is

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.360
about creating a
sense of presence,

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.760
taking people from
the real world

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.080
and helping them teleport
to somewhere else,

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.360
Tango is all about basically
taking the computers

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.190
that we have in our
pocket and teaching

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:58.660
them to see the world
the same way that we do.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.620
And if you think
about our phones,

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.630
we have them with us everywhere.

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.760
And they have some
amazing sensors in them.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.610
They have accelerometers and
gyro and GPS and cameras.

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:10.160
But they still
don't fundamentally

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.160
think of the world or see it and
understand it to the same level

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.480
that humans do.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.010
For example, if you take a
look at this coffee table here,

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.700
it's not just a bunch of pixels.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.650
As humans, we look
at it, and we know

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.600
that there's important
features, that there

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.360
are edges that are sharp
and corners that we

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.310
might bump into.

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.150
We know that some
sides are flat,

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.420
that it has a top and a bottom.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.819
We know that that object
doesn't just exist in isolation.

00:12:34.819 --> 00:12:36.860
We know that there are
other objects around that,

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.200
that that vase is on
top of the coffee table,

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.140
that the coffee table
is near the sofa.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.002
And in fact, we know
not just about objects

00:12:44.002 --> 00:12:44.960
and their relationship.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.430
We think about spaces.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:49.310
We think about how this
coffee table is in a room,

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.140
and that room has
many things in it.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.830
And as you start to think
about and understand a space,

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:57.290
you can actually consider not
just the physical objects,

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:58.760
but what might also be there.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.970
You can imagine that if
this family had a baby,

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:03.750
they might add some
additional objects.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.870
In fact, it's not just
about what might be there.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.850
It's about how the
objects behave,

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.734
that there are things like
door knobs and light switches

00:13:10.734 --> 00:13:12.650
that are interactive
that have special meaning

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:16.330
and special functionality in
the context of that space.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.060
And Tango is all
about enabling phones

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.920
to understand the world
exactly like we do,

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.820
in a structured
and deep fashion.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.540
And there's really
three technologies

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.710
that allow us to do that.

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:31.140
The first is motion tracking.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.040
There is depth perception
and area learning.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:37.610
And these are the pillars that
Tango has built on top of.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:39.620
So with motion
tracking, it's all

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.750
about helping the
phone understand where

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:44.900
it is in space, both its
position and orientation

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.460
as you move around.

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.260
And you might think,
well I have GPS.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.910
Doesn't that already
give me position?

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.800
I've got a gyro
and accelerometer.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.480
Doesn't that give
me orientation?

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.530
Well, they do, but
they're very coarse.

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.430
GPS is accurate to
centimeters or meters

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.020
and worse when you're indoors.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.290
The gyros have drift over time.

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:04.540
But Tango fuses all
of that and uses

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.640
a technology called
visual inertial odometry

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.330
to get very, very precise
estimates of exactly where it

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.770
is in space.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:16.790
And you can see examples of the
360, 3D movement all the time--

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.640
super precise,
super low latency.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.830
But we also want to
understand the world

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:24.790
that the device interacts in--
not just where it is in space,

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:26.755
but what the outside
world looks like.

00:14:26.755 --> 00:14:29.030
And that's where you
get to depth perception.

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:31.430
Depth perception allows
us to actually understand

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:33.530
the 3D nature of the world.

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:35.690
We can tell you that
some objects are close

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:36.850
and some objects are far.

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:39.680
We can tell you that walls
are flat and vertical

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.330
and floors are flat
and horizontal,

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.640
and some things are
not flat at all.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.710
And when you combine
depth perception

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.840
with motion tracking,
you can actually

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.300
build a very
detailed, accurate map

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.020
of the world, the phone's
sense of where it is in space

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.150
and where space is around it.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.780
But unfortunately, with
just those two things,

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:02.030
you've got to build a map,
and then you leave the app,

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:03.380
and we've lost it.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.240
So that's where area
learning comes in.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.580
Area earning allows us
to not just build up

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:11.050
a map of the world, but
to remember it over time,

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:14.350
and not just remember the world,
but to share maps across users.

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:17.000
So if somebody has mapped an
area and been there before,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.786
other users can benefit
from that information.

00:15:19.786 --> 00:15:22.160
And when you combine motion
tracking and depth perception

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.220
and area learning, you can
get some incredibly powerful

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.790
experiences.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:29.180
You can actually build
a very precise measuring

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.980
tape using your phone
and its touch screen.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.900
You never have to carry
a measuring tape again,

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.483
just like phones
have already replaced

00:15:34.483 --> 00:15:36.430
flashlights for most people.

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:38.180
If you're a commerce
app, you can actually

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.360
have people look
at a good and see

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.210
how it's going to look in
their real space, size, scale,

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.790
and lighting before they've
ever made the purchase.

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:48.456
And you're going to
hear more about that

00:15:48.456 --> 00:15:49.760
later this afternoon.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.040
Of course, for gaming,
augmented reality is awesome.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.430
You can have virtual pets that
inhabit the same world you do

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.290
or gaming that
actually interacts

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.900
with the physical objects
and dynamically responds

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:03.020
to the real world environment
you find yourself in.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.020
And last, you can explore
your world more fully.

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:09.200
There's everything from highly
precise indoor navigation

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.260
to enhanced learning, to
actually augmenting the objects

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.950
around us with additional
information and interactivity.

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.500
And for me, these are incredibly
exciting opportunities.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.090
And I hope that
together, I've given you

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:26.120
an idea of the opportunity in
immersive computing in both VR

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.820
through Daydream
and AR for Tango.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.290
And although these things may
sound very exotic and crazy,

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:35.000
the foundations are actually
incredibly familiar to you

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:35.840
as developers.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:40.490
Both Daydream and Tango are
built on top of Android.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:43.810
And Android is, of course, the
foundation for both of them.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:48.050
We have native C
NDKs and Java SDKs

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:49.610
for both Daydream and Tango.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.950
So actually, enhancing
your existing apps

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:54.890
with either AR or VR is going
to be super straightforward

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:57.050
if you're a native
Android developer today.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:59.290
And of course, with Android,
you get Google Play.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:01.310
And like you saw, we've
integrated everything

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:05.510
from the stores to IEP deeply
into both Tango and Daydream

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:08.089
so you can leverage all
of the transactions,

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:10.520
the payments in
dozens of countries,

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.730
all of the user analytics and
customer engagement features.

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:15.530
All of that familiar
and powerful toolset

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:19.130
is available for you
today in AR and VR.

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:21.680
We know that many of you,
if you're doing 3D already,

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.619
you're maybe using a game
engine like Unity or Unreal.

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:26.990
And we've built deep
partnerships with both Epic,

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:30.500
the maker of Unreal, and
with Unity for first class

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.549
native support for both
Tango and Daydream.

00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:34.840
And that means that if you're
using these game engines,

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.430
you'll get first class,
super easy to use,

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:41.240
very high performance AR and VR
with both of these world class

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.810
game engines.

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:47.180
I hope all of this has given
you a sense of the potential,

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.060
the vision, the
scale and the impact

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:50.979
that immersive computing
is going to have.

00:17:50.979 --> 00:17:52.520
If you want to know
more, if you want

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.879
to be a developer for Daydream
or Tango, or hopefully both,

00:17:55.879 --> 00:17:56.795
check them out online.

00:17:56.795 --> 00:17:58.790
There are developer
resources and tons more

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:00.752
information available for you.

00:18:00.752 --> 00:18:02.210
We can't wait to
see what you make.

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:03.740
Thank you so much for your time.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:07.090
