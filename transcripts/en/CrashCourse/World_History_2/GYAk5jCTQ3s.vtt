00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.960
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
World History and today we’re returning

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.080
to a subject that, could have an entire Crash Course
series all of its own: the Industrial Revolution.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.180
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, are you going to do
a whole series on the Industrial Revolution?

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.560
Because that actually sounds really boring.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.840
Yeah, Me From the Past, no. I’m a little bit
busy. I’ve got this movie that’s about

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.949
to film. So yeah, no. But, uh, we are going
to talk about like a specific and essential

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.840
slice of the Industrial Revolution, that also
like pleases my four year old self a lot: Railroads!

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.380
Choooga chooga choooga chooga choo choo! 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.220
We’re going to be talking about a small book by
Wolfgang Schivelbusch called "The Railway Journey."

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.520
So in this Crash Course World History series
we’re talking a lot about a lot of different

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.180
history books so that we can approach subjects
from a variety of angles.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.640
We want to try to introduce you to how exciting
history can be and also how unsettled it is.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.380
How many arguments there still are.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.480
So to be clear, I’m not saying I agree with
everything in this book - it’s one interpretation

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.470
of a series of events. But it contains a ton
of interesting ideas, and it’s one of those

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.270
books that makes you think differently about
the world.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.060
And it’s vitally important that we think
about the role technology plays in our lives

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.690
including the technology of railroads.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.540
So railroads were these big, loud machines
that people hadn’t seen before, which makes

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.149
them a pretty good metaphor for industrialization.

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.580
Also, since not everyone worked in factories,
railways were one of the few places that both

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.789
middle and upper class people came face to
face with industrial machinery.

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.289
You know, if you were a factory worker that
stuff was around you all day everyday slowly

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.909
killing your soul. But if you were, say, a
mortgage broker your work life hadn’t changed

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.130
- it’s not like you had a computer.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.369
But the presence of railroads reminded you
that you were in a different world from that

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.789
of your parents or grandparents. It wasn’t
just locomotion though, the railway itself

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.200
changed the idea of an industrial machine
to include its surrounding infrastructure, right?

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.620
You needed rails and these huge engines. You
needed timetables and organization. That

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.619
encompassed everything that industrialization was about.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.959
And since railways changed the lives of middle
and upper class people, who tend to write

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.020
a lot, we know a lot about them.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.060
And the change was definitely seen as radical.
For instance the phrase, “annihilation of

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.990
time and space” was a pretty popular one
when talking about railways.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.760
This wasn’t just a fancy way of talking
about how railways sped up travel, but also

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.530
the way that the railroad destroyed traditional
relationships with nature.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.920
I mean sometimes nature was literally annihilated
as when tunnels were cut through hills and

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.240
depressions were graded to make the railroad as
straight as possible, “as if drawn with a ruler."

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.080
But railroads also shaped space and time in
a manner totally unprecedented in human history

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.340
by, for instance, speeding up travel times
which shrunk the world.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.720
And then they expanded space by creating suburbs
and new towns.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.430
In a positive development for 99% of the population,
railroads changed space too by opening up

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.200
previously inaccessible like vacation spots
of the wealthy.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.500
Then the wealthy migrated further away to
places only accessible by air travel like,

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.000
I don’t know, Ibiza. But now Ibiza’s full
of Eurotrash because of inexpensive airlines.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.220
Where will the 1% vacation!

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.930
Poor rich people that have to go to the Hamptons
which aren’t even that nice, they’re just

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.730
really expensive.
And then there’s the fact that railroads

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.610
literally changed time, or at least created
the standardization of time. Like before railroads,

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.160
time in London was 4 minutes ahead of Reading,
and 14 minutes ahead of time in Bridgwater.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.190
Then in 1847 The Railway Clearing House – an
organization established to regulate rail

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.310
travel – established Greenwich mean time
as the standard time on all rail lines, and

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.850
in 1880 it became general standard time in
England.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.220
So to be clear, time as you know it is about as
old as the oldest living person in the world.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.290
But, the most obvious way that railroads changed
things was travel. Until railroads, all travel

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.980
was powered by muscles – either animal or
human – so we had a sense of distance as

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.640
defined by fatigue. Like when your horse died,
you had gone a long way.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.610
Or your horse like sprained a leg going down
a hill and you had to shoot it.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.510
Point being, for 250,000 years all power was
muscle power and unless you could like ride

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.650
a cheetah you weren’t going to go faster
than about 20 mph.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.300
So babies could go really fast because they
can ride cheetahs, but adults, there’s no

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.240
way, cheetahs weigh like 20 lbs. As Thomas
De Quincey put it:

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.260
“When we are travelling by stage-coach at
the rate of eight or ten miles an hour, we

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.130
can understand the nature of the force which
sets the vehicle in motion … and in the

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.090
course of a day’s journey we can appreciate
the enormous succession of efforts required

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.150
to transport a loaded vehicle from London
to a distant town.”

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.540
Although to be fair, De Quincey’s ideas
about enormous effort may have been a bit

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.520
skewed as he also wrote Confessions of an
Opium Eater

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.750
Anyway, People were so comfortable with horses
that some even argued that horsepower was

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.350
superior to mechanical locomotion because
horses relied more on renewable and easily

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.400
obtained fuel.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.280
By the way, as you may see in comments there
is still a debate about whether horse power

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.260
or railroads are more carbon efficient.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.620
Anyway, the romantics at the time saw railroad
travel as a “loss of a communicative relationship

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.320
between man and nature.” And some also saw
the old technology – horses – as having

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.700
like more soul.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.070
Mechanical travel was generally seen as a
definite economic win since it “rendered

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.930
all transportation calculable,” and economists
love to calculate. Railroads also changed

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.620
the way we looked at the world, like literally
through a window, with nature being this blur.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.130
And you can argue that like watching the world
go by through a static window kind of prepared

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.010
people for motion pictures and television
where we stare at a screen that doesn’t

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.000
move and watch a world that does.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.340
Now these noisy, coal powered trains affected
all the senses, but especially vision. As

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.710
Victor Hugo described it in 1837,

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:40.000
“the flowers by the side of the road are
no longer flowers but fleck, or rather streaks

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.250
of red and white; there are no longer any
points, everything becomes a streak.”

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.530
So many people experienced this landscape
as a monotonous blur, but for others it was

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.540
something new and exciting. For Benjamin Gastineau,
the constantly changing view was thrilling:

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.820
“in quick succession it presents the astonished
traveler with happy scenes, sad scenes, burlesque

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.520
interludes, brilliant fireworks, all visions
that disappear as soon as they are seen.”

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.580
That sounds like a great movie. All I see when I
look out the train window is the infinite abyss of 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.520
meaninglessness, and then I pull out my phone and
open Floppy Bird and everything is okay again.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.600
And railroad travel also changed human behavior.
Okay let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.560
Since looking at the landscape was no longer
the same experience, and, according to the

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.010
medical journal The Lancet, “The rapidity
and variety of the impressions necessarily

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:27.140
fatigue both the eye and the brain.” many
people turned to reading books on railroads.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.580
For starters, reading was a way for upper
class passengers to avoid having to talk with

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.050
each other. European first and second class
rail cars were designed to mimic stage coaches,

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.050
with passengers facing each other. Now, in
pre-railroad travel, you knew you were going

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.360
to be stuck with whoever else was in your
stagecoach, so it was important to try to

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.400
be nice and strike up a conversation. But
the short duration of railroad journeys discouraged

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.710
the formation of rapport between travellers,
changing our habits and turning reading on

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.560
the train into a necessity.
Rail travel also brought new fears, like when

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.500
travelling at the speed of a cannonball, it
was hard to overcome one’s terror of a possible

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.699
derailment. As Thomas Creevy put it:

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:07.160
“It is really flying, and it is impossible
to divest yourself of the notion of instant

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.980
death to all upon the least accident happening.”

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.960
So that’s why I’m afraid of flying. And
to be fair railway accidents were common enough

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.370
that physicians began to document cases of
“railway spine” a condition suffered by

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:24.169
people who had come through railway accidents
with complaints of pain, but few or no signs

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:28.419
of physical injury. By the end of the 1880s,
however, railway spine gave way as a diagnosis

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:33.460
to “traumatic neurosis” reflecting new
ideas in psychology. Eventually, pathological

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:39.140
explanations for what looks a lot like nervous shock
slipped away and only the psychological ones were left.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:44.010
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So new technologies
often bring new anxieties because change is

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:47.580
terrifying. Remember how the internet was
going to bring an end to reading books?

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.910
Remember how “e-learning” was going to
replace classrooms and there were going to

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.880
be all of these “e-teachers” who would
replace your real teachers?

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.580
But yeah, no, it turns out that real life
teachers are pretty great.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.380
Like Heinrich Heins wrote that railroads produced

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:03.400
“tremendous foreboding such as we always
feel when there comes an enormous, an unheard-of

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.100
event whose consequences are imponderable
an incalculable.”

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:11.960
Fortunately, our new industrial world view
associated change with progress.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.380
Like this notion that humans move forward,
that children will have a better life than

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.350
their parents did - that’s new.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.830
As… oh it’s time for the Open letter!

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.580
But first let’s see what’s in the globe
today - oh no, it’s change. I hate change.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:29.310
An Open Letter to Progress: One of the reasons,
I think, we’re afraid of change is that change

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.480
doesn’t really mean progress.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.540
For the vast majority of human history the
lives of children could be much worse than

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:41.200
the lives of their parents. It depended on disease and
weather and kings - mostly on disease and weather.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.370
There was no idea that moving forward also
meant moving up.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.640
And I would argue that certainly innovation
has given us much to be grateful for, but

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.830
there’s something to a reluctance to change.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:54.250
I love you progress and you have given me
much to be grateful for, but a gentle reminder:

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.810
change doesn’t always mean progress.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:58.430
Best wishes, John Green.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:03.180
So as Schivelbusch puts it “new modes of
behavior and perception enabled the traveler

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.080
to lose the fear that he formerly felt towards
the new conveyance.”

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:12.000
“The sinister aspect of the machinery that
first was so evident and frightening gradually

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.310
disappeared, and with this disappearance,
fear waned and was replaced by a feeling of

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:18.650
security based on familiarity.”

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:23.280
Huh, that sounds precisely like my relationship
with a phone that always knows where I am.

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:27.430
New technologies often change the way people
live and perceive the world. Like one example

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:32.270
would be the printing press. It made knowledge
and information available as never before.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:36.330
But it only really affected a small segment
of the population, at least initially.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:41.260
Industrialization was different in that it
had a profound effect on large numbers of

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:46.130
people in a very short time. And since the
dawn of industrialization, the pace of this

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:52.260
change and the enormity of its impact has only
increased like, well, like a speeding train I guess.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.100
Except it’s like a speeding train that gets
faster and faster until it reaches the speed

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:58.250
of light - oh my gosh what a wonderful idea.
Somebody call Elon Musk.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:03.380
So for most of us the Internet is a technology
very much like the railroad. Like the railroad,

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:08.620
the Internet in its earliest stages was both frightening
to detractors and exhilarating to its boosters.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.500
And like railroads it has both shrunk the
world, enabling me to communicate with you

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.959
via, you know, the tubes - I don’t really
know how the Internet works.

00:10:15.959 --> 00:10:18.270
And it's also changed our perception of time.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:23.510
Think about how much sooner you expect a response
to an email or text message vs a letter or

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.890
even a phone call.
Think about the fact that you can order a

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:32.360
phone from China and have it arrive at your door in a
week and that still feels like kind of a long time.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.830
In the age of the railroads to get a phone,
which didn’t exist, from China to Indianapolis

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:41.140
would’ve taken months. To get that same
nonexistent phone from China to Indianapolis

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:45.560
in 1700 would’ve taken more than a year.
And then you turn it on and there’s not

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.130
even a cell network. And you’re like “This
is essentially just a brick. I waited more

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:52.100
than a year and I can’t do anything with
it!” And once the battery dies you’re

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.630
going to go to plug it in and oh right there’s
no freaking electricity!

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.930
So yeah, the world is different. Now like
railroads there’s plenty of nostalgia about

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:05.370
the time before the Internet when people supposedly
consumed less and talked to each other more

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.440
because they weren’t constantly on their phones.

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:11.500
But if railroad reading is any indication
we’ve been looking for ways to use technology

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.399
to avoid interacting with each other in real
life for a long time.

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:19.810
And we shouldn’t forget that railroads made
travel easier and opened up new vistas and

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:23.190
made goods less expensive and brought people
closer together.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:28.380
And they also helped create the idea of nostalgia.
I mean without industrial production the nostalgia

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:32.500
for pre-industrial methods of travel and manufacture
couldn’t exist.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.500
One of the best things about books like “The
Railway Journey,” is that they help us to

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:40.350
draw parallels between the past and the present
and get us to focus on overlooked aspects

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:44.010
of history, like what it meant for people
to ride on trains for the first time.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:47.610
Now our study of history shouldn’t be focused
too much on what we in the present can learn

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:52.490
from the past, but trying to glimpse innovation
and change as those who lived through it saw

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:57.080
it, well I think that can be very useful to those of us
living through a new technological revolution.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.940
Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:03.110
Crash Course is filmed here in the Chad and
Stacey Emigholz studio in Indianapolis, it’s

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:07.610
possible because of all these nice people
who make it, and because of our Subbable subscribers.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:10.670
Subbable is a voluntary subscription service
that allows you to support Crash Course directly

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:15.210
so we can keep it free for everyone forever.
Also you can get like, I don’t know, Mongol

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:18.070
t-shirts, posters, DVD’s if you want to
support us.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:22.320
Regardless, thanks for watching and as we
say in my hometown, “thanks for being awesome.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.461
Wait, no, we say, “don’t forget to be
awesome.”
