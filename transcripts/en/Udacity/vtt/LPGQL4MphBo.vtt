00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.870
Okay, let's suppose you live in
Seattle and you want to make an order.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.700
You look at the prices on your computer.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.650
You see what you think looks like
the prices are going to go up.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.010
So you enter a buy order.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.950
Now your order travels all
the way across the country.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.500
And because you use ETrade
it stops in Atlanta, and

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.260
then it hops to New York City.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.920
Let's now zoom in and

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.330
see what's happening at
the Exchange in New York City.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.040
So, we've zoomed into the New York Stock
Exchange, and the order book there is

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.310
visible to you over in Seattle, but
also to computers that are colocated.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.810
So, let's suppose our hedge
fund has a colocated computer.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.540
And it's observing
the order book as well.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.770
Now here's the advantage that
this colocated hedge fund has.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.579
It's computer is located maybe a 100
meters away from the main exchange

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.959
computer that holds the order book.

00:00:57.959 --> 00:01:02.065
So that 100 meters amounts to 0.3
microseconds in terms of how long

00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:07.440
it takes information about the order
book to reach that hedge fund computer.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.163
You, on the other hand,
are located at least 2500 miles away.

00:01:12.163 --> 00:01:14.920
And that means when this
order book changes,

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.349
it takes 12 milliseconds at least for
that information to get to you and

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:23.360
12 milliseconds at least for
your order to reach the exchange.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.340
So, here's how what I call
the order book exploit works.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.950
The hedge fund is continually
observing the order book.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.000
And remember, it takes only 0.3
microsceconds for it to do that.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.650
Based on what it sees at the order book,
it thinks the price is going to go up.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.770
The hedge fund buys some of that
stock based on what it sees.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.290
You're thinking the same thing,
so you've entered buy.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.700
And your order starts making
its way across the country.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.680
While your order is coming
across the country, indeed,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.740
the price is going up, because other
orders are coming in from other places.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.630
Eventually, your order makes it to
the New York Stock Exchange and

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.330
is executed there.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.960
And, in fact,
the hedge fund sells it to you.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.410
And over this few fractions of a second,

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.420
the hedge fund has bought some stock,
watched it go up and sold it.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.550
It might have held this 100 shares of
stock for only a few milliseconds and

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.180
made a profit.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.460
And the hedge fund is
exploiting essentially

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.080
all these people remotely located around
the country observing the order book,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.240
essentially late sending in orders
that it can take advantage of because

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.330
it can act much earlier before those
orders from around the country arrive.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.450
There's certainly many sorts of
ways to exploit market mechanics.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.597
Here's one more.

00:02:43.597 --> 00:02:47.650
I call this one the geographic
arbitrage exploit.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.470
Suppose we have exchanges
located some distance away and

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.500
because they're located distantly prices
may drift a little bit up or down.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.370
Now a hedge fund might place their own
servers at each of these Exchanges and

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.170
connect them with an ultra high
speed dedicated connection.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.460
And they're observing the order book,

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.130
the prices at both these locations
all the time and comparing notes.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.680
Let's suppose a difference
emerges that in New York

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.760
the price is a little bit lower,
in London price is a little bit higher.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.750
The fund will immediately buy
in New York, and sell in London.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.890
They're not necessarily even
transferring those same shares.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.960
They might buy some set of
shares in New York City, and

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.110
sell a different set in London.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.460
But they're getting that difference
in price advantage immediately.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.450
Now, because hedge funds do this,
because they're monitoring the prices

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.610
that exchanges all over the world, these
sorts of differences rarely arise and

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.250
when they do it's just
by fractions of a cent.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.530
But those differences do arise because
there are inefficiencies in the markets

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.640
and there are hedge funds there to
pick those pennies up off the ground.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.020
Again, this is geographic arbitrage.
