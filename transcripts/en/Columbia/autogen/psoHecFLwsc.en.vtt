well I was gave that for lung cancer
 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:56.049
well I was gave that for lung cancer
rates actually on it is higher than all

00:06:56.049 --> 00:06:56.059
rates actually on it is higher than all

Koreans Filipinos and Chinese that is
 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.709
Koreans Filipinos and Chinese that is
very much smoking related and as we know

00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:05.719
very much smoking related and as we know
 

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:08.079
very much smoking related and as we know
oftentimes if you look at the national

00:07:08.079 --> 00:07:08.089
oftentimes if you look at the national
 

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:10.779
oftentimes if you look at the national
data and the smoking race is not very

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:10.789
data and the smoking race is not very
 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:14.379
data and the smoking race is not very
high there is actually some issues

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:14.389
high there is actually some issues
 

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:16.689
high there is actually some issues
related to the national data collection

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:16.699
related to the national data collection
 

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:20.050
related to the national data collection
because most of the time these studies

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:20.060
because most of the time these studies
 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:24.029
because most of the time these studies
national studies which english speaking

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:24.039
national studies which english speaking
 

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:26.679
national studies which english speaking
asian populations so the non-english

higher smoking rates this is one of our

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:32.360
higher smoking rates this is one of our
 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.839
higher smoking rates this is one of our
recent studies have trying to look at on

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:34.849
recent studies have trying to look at on
 

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:38.499
recent studies have trying to look at on
the early detection in different type of

00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:38.509
the early detection in different type of
 

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:40.899
the early detection in different type of
cancers among various Asian ethnic

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:40.909
cancers among various Asian ethnic
 

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:45.510
cancers among various Asian ethnic
populations and also health checkup and

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520
populations and also health checkup and
 

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.860
populations and also health checkup and
especially among Chinese Korean

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:47.870
especially among Chinese Korean
 

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.049
especially among Chinese Korean
Vietnamese and a Cambodian population

00:07:50.049 --> 00:07:50.059
Vietnamese and a Cambodian population
 

00:07:50.059 --> 00:07:53.079
Vietnamese and a Cambodian population
and if we take a look at just on these

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:53.089
and if we take a look at just on these
 

00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:56.709
and if we take a look at just on these
few cancer early detection and you can

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:56.719
few cancer early detection and you can
 

00:07:56.719 --> 00:07:59.180
few cancer early detection and you can
see even among the Korean pop

00:07:59.180 --> 00:07:59.190
see even among the Korean pop
 

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:04.230
see even among the Korean pop
about 60 or 50 cent or fifty five

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.240
about 60 or 50 cent or fifty five
 

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.830
about 60 or 50 cent or fifty five

ago I never had and if you take a look

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:13.780
ago I never had and if you take a look
 

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.840
ago I never had and if you take a look
at further of breast cancer cervical

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:15.850
at further of breast cancer cervical
 

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:19.440

five years ago ahem down swinging is

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:23.320
five years ago ahem down swinging is
 

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.130
five years ago ahem down swinging is
also very high this there is a variation

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:26.140
also very high this there is a variation
 

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.920
also very high this there is a variation
among various groups if you look at a

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:28.930
among various groups if you look at a
 

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.470
among various groups if you look at a
rectal cancer a never screening rate is

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:31.480
rectal cancer a never screening rate is
 

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.680
rectal cancer a never screening rate is
high among all of these groups so this

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:34.690
high among all of these groups so this
 

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.230
high among all of these groups so this
gave us a sort of a baseline of where we

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:37.240
gave us a sort of a baseline of where we
 

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:53.700
gave us a sort of a baseline of where we
take in in terms of cancer detection

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:53.710
 

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.680
alright because you can't move on next

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:56.690
alright because you can't move on next

it's crazy

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:23.790
 

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.640
alright this is the example of our

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:26.650
alright this is the example of our
 

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:30.030
alright this is the example of our
patient navigation where as I mentioned

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:30.040
patient navigation where as I mentioned
 

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.620
patient navigation where as I mentioned
the healthcare system it is not ready to

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:33.630
the healthcare system it is not ready to
 

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:36.440
the healthcare system it is not ready to
really serve the Asian population

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:36.450
really serve the Asian population
 

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:41.010
really serve the Asian population
oftentimes the translation line is not a

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:41.020
oftentimes the translation line is not a
 

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:42.930
oftentimes the translation line is not a
really very effective so

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:42.940
really very effective so
 

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.690
really very effective so
person-to-person navigation is very

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:45.700
person-to-person navigation is very
 

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.810
person-to-person navigation is very
critical to overcome the barriers to

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:48.820
critical to overcome the barriers to
 

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.870
critical to overcome the barriers to
provide a clinical support and this

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:51.880
provide a clinical support and this
 

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.960
provide a clinical support and this
become one of the critical component in

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:54.970
become one of the critical component in
 

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:57.780
become one of the critical component in
our intervention and often times this

00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:57.790
our intervention and often times this
 

00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:00.300
our intervention and often times this
will increase the effectiveness of the

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:00.310
will increase the effectiveness of the
 

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:02.430
will increase the effectiveness of the
program this is the example of our

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:02.440
program this is the example of our
 

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.100
program this is the example of our
patient navigator or is helping the

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:05.110
patient navigator or is helping the
 

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:08.040
patient navigator or is helping the
patients conducting the mammogram and

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:08.050
patients conducting the mammogram and
 

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:12.050
patients conducting the mammogram and
also if there's a normal cases of

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:12.060
also if there's a normal cases of
 

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:15.570
also if there's a normal cases of
navigators also help them getting

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:15.580
navigators also help them getting
 

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:18.090
navigators also help them getting
further evaluation for the diagnostic

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:18.100
further evaluation for the diagnostic
 

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:21.390
further evaluation for the diagnostic
testing as well as as well as follow-up

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:21.400
testing as well as as well as follow-up
 

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.640
testing as well as as well as follow-up
treatment so these are the components

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:23.650
treatment so these are the components
 

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:26.250
treatment so these are the components
were look at not only an individual

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:26.260
were look at not only an individual
 

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.160
were look at not only an individual
level but also at a system level family

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:29.170
level but also at a system level family
 

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:32.150
level but also at a system level family
support so it's a lot more as a

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:32.160
support so it's a lot more as a
 

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:36.030
support so it's a lot more as a
ecological approach to incorporate into

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:36.040
ecological approach to incorporate into
 

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:43.860
ecological approach to incorporate into

the things that often times and as
 

00:34:56.530 --> 00:35:00.060
the things that often times and as
direct implementation we do ask our

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:00.070
direct implementation we do ask our
 

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:03.960
direct implementation we do ask our
clients and also the smokers and coming

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:03.970
clients and also the smokers and coming
 

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:06.660
clients and also the smokers and coming
in to see if these are the culture

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:06.670
in to see if these are the culture
 

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:09.240
in to see if these are the culture
issues that they would feel is its

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:09.250
issues that they would feel is its
 

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:13.050
issues that they would feel is its
effective as a sort of consumer and and

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:13.060
effective as a sort of consumer and and
 

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:15.810
effective as a sort of consumer and and
this this is a part of that we have been

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:15.820
this this is a part of that we have been
 

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.240
this this is a part of that we have been
keep on changing and testing and

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:18.250
keep on changing and testing and
 

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:22.710
keep on changing and testing and
oftentimes we do use the measurements

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720
oftentimes we do use the measurements
 

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.170
oftentimes we do use the measurements
and variables are being already proved

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:25.180
and variables are being already proved
 

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:27.540
and variables are being already proved
the validating and validated in other

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:27.550
the validating and validated in other
 

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:29.790
the validating and validated in other
ethnic groups or we were in it to the

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:29.800
ethnic groups or we were in it to the
 

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.980
ethnic groups or we were in it to the
asian populations the question doesn't

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:31.990
asian populations the question doesn't
 

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:34.470
asian populations the question doesn't
mean anything to them so we have to

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480
mean anything to them so we have to
 

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:37.680
mean anything to them so we have to
change the questions in the sort of the

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:37.690
change the questions in the sort of the
 

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:41.550
change the questions in the sort of the
cultural context in in the situation

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:41.560
cultural context in in the situation
 

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.220
cultural context in in the situation
culture that they are familiar with for

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:44.230
culture that they are familiar with for
 

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:46.830
culture that they are familiar with for
example where we talked about the cost

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:46.840
example where we talked about the cost
 

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:50.100
example where we talked about the cost
of smoking and we will now use examples

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:50.110
of smoking and we will now use examples
 

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:54.030
of smoking and we will now use examples
about the tax or we have to talk about

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:54.040
about the tax or we have to talk about
 

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.730
about the tax or we have to talk about
you you too now smoke you can save a

00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:56.740
you you too now smoke you can save a
 

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:59.730
you you too now smoke you can save a
ticket for go to Korea go to China so

00:35:59.730 --> 00:35:59.740
ticket for go to Korea go to China so
 

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.980
ticket for go to Korea go to China so
you put in the context that they can

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:01.990
you put in the context that they can
 

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:04.980
you put in the context that they can
relate and they can so sit with and the

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:04.990
relate and they can so sit with and the
 

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:09.210
relate and they can so sit with and the
in terms of when we have any data to

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:09.220
in terms of when we have any data to
 

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:11.700
in terms of when we have any data to
support I think we do have some

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:11.710
support I think we do have some
 

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:14.040
support I think we do have some
intervention publications already

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:14.050
intervention publications already
 

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:18.090
intervention publications already
demonstrated the outcome effectiveness

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:18.100
demonstrated the outcome effectiveness
 

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:20.850
demonstrated the outcome effectiveness
and which we're trying to look at the

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:20.860
and which we're trying to look at the
 

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:22.010
and which we're trying to look at the
variables and

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:22.020
variables and
 

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.020
variables and
where the knowledge that woman also

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:24.030
where the knowledge that woman also
 

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:27.560
where the knowledge that woman also
believe attitudes and behavior changes

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:27.570
believe attitudes and behavior changes
 

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:30.920
believe attitudes and behavior changes
at the different stages and you know not

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:30.930
at the different stages and you know not
 

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:35.450
at the different stages and you know not
only at the post-test but also three

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:35.460
only at the post-test but also three
 

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.780
only at the post-test but also three
months six months and twelve months and

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:37.790
months six months and twelve months and
 

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:42.230
months six months and twelve months and
this are sort of giving us a some

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240
this are sort of giving us a some
 

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.220
this are sort of giving us a some
promising impact but the culture

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:45.230
promising impact but the culture
 

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:48.650
promising impact but the culture
adaptation as i mentioned each time and

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:48.660
adaptation as i mentioned each time and
 

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:50.840
adaptation as i mentioned each time and
each study and we have to sort of

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:50.850
each study and we have to sort of
 

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:53.540
each study and we have to sort of
continue to modify to tailor toward a

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:53.550
continue to modify to tailor toward a
 

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:56.990
continue to modify to tailor toward a
population we work with and in the

00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.000
population we work with and in the
 

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.720
population we work with and in the
incense that we're trying to use the

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:01.730
 

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:04.760
evidence-based intervention not only

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:04.770
evidence-based intervention not only
 

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:07.190
evidence-based intervention not only
tested in other population but also

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200
tested in other population but also
 

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.950
tested in other population but also
tested in our population for example

00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:09.960
tested in our population for example
 

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:14.210
tested in our population for example
those are ones we got the received from

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:14.220
those are ones we got the received from
 

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:17.150
those are ones we got the received from
an age we have adapted the health belief

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160
an age we have adapted the health belief
 

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.880
an age we have adapted the health belief
model of social cognitive model but a

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:19.890
model of social cognitive model but a
 

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:21.560
model of social cognitive model but a
lot of times these measurements are

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:21.570
lot of times these measurements are
 

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:24.680
lot of times these measurements are
already changed and it's way over how to

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:24.690
already changed and it's way over how to
 

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:29.240
already changed and it's way over how to
ask patients and the intervention

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:29.250
ask patients and the intervention
 

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:32.750
ask patients and the intervention
contents are have changed however the

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760
contents are have changed however the
 

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.420
contents are have changed however the
framework is there major principles are

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:35.430
framework is there major principles are
 

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:37.970
framework is there major principles are
still there so that's where how we do

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:37.980
still there so that's where how we do
 

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:40.730
still there so that's where how we do
the dap tation and so is still very

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:40.740
the dap tation and so is still very
 

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:43.640
the dap tation and so is still very
challenging and it takes time to really

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:43.650
challenging and it takes time to really
 

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:46.520
challenging and it takes time to really
prove it works for the population and

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:46.530
prove it works for the population and
 

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:49.370
prove it works for the population and
i'm sure we have a long way to go and I

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:49.380
i'm sure we have a long way to go and I
 

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:52.550
i'm sure we have a long way to go and I
really see this as a beginning and of

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560
really see this as a beginning and of
 

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.680
really see this as a beginning and of
our journey in working with the asian

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:54.690
our journey in working with the asian
 

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:56.930
our journey in working with the asian
population this is a such an your hair

00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:56.940
population this is a such an your hair
 

00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:00.980
population this is a such an your hair
it has not been focused on at different

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:00.990
it has not been focused on at different
 

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:08.390
it has not been focused on at different
level yeah excellent and do another

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400
level yeah excellent and do another
 

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.630
level yeah excellent and do another
question too

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:09.640
question too
 

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:21.040
question too
it's too than happen it socially yes

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:21.050
 

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:23.620
hi back thank you for your presentation

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:23.630
hi back thank you for your presentation
 

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:27.910
hi back thank you for your presentation
I have a general question where you

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920
I have a general question where you
 

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:30.430
I have a general question where you
cited by beautiful gaze up the ninety

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:30.440
cited by beautiful gaze up the ninety
 

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.490
cited by beautiful gaze up the ninety
percent on most recent immigrants and

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:33.500
percent on most recent immigrants and
 

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:36.730
percent on most recent immigrants and
I'm particularly curious about the

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:36.740
I'm particularly curious about the
 

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:39.210
I'm particularly curious about the
different generations looking back

00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:39.220
different generations looking back
 

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:42.460
different generations looking back
specifically for the Chinese American

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:42.470
specifically for the Chinese American
 

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:44.110
specifically for the Chinese American
community communities that have been

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:44.120
community communities that have been
 

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:47.020
community communities that have been
here and have a longer history back five

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:47.030
here and have a longer history back five
 

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:49.960
here and have a longer history back five
generations which generations going down

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:49.970
generations which generations going down
 

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:52.270
generations which generations going down
to Louisiana to Filipino masher and

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:52.280
to Louisiana to Filipino masher and
 

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.640
to Louisiana to Filipino masher and
we're looking at that the health

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:54.650
we're looking at that the health
 

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:56.500
we're looking at that the health
implications that go along for those

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:56.510
implications that go along for those
 

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:58.360
implications that go along for those
generations had there been any studies

00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:58.370
generations had there been any studies
 

00:38:58.370 --> 00:39:00.580
generations had there been any studies
are there any plans for your Center to

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:00.590
are there any plans for your Center to
 

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:04.030
are there any plans for your Center to
really look at that and just try it and

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:04.040
really look at that and just try it and
 

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.580
really look at that and just try it and
try it out and map that right pattern

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:06.590
try it out and map that right pattern
 

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:09.760
try it out and map that right pattern
and incorporating this question about

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:09.770
and incorporating this question about
 

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:11.920
and incorporating this question about
acculturation and how it's different I

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:11.930
acculturation and how it's different I
 

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:13.990
acculturation and how it's different I
think that's a very good question we

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000
think that's a very good question we
 

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.150
think that's a very good question we
have done some baseline studies trying

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160
have done some baseline studies trying
 

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.250
have done some baseline studies trying
to look at you know the smoking

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:18.260
to look at you know the smoking
 

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.980
to look at you know the smoking
behaviors and cancer early detection

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:19.990
behaviors and cancer early detection
 

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:23.410
behaviors and cancer early detection
behaviors how the culture cultivation

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:23.420
behaviors how the culture cultivation
 

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:26.920
behaviors how the culture cultivation
factors would impact on these behaviors

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:26.930
factors would impact on these behaviors
 

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:29.080
factors would impact on these behaviors
but in terms of the intervention we have

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:29.090
but in terms of the intervention we have
 

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:31.990
but in terms of the intervention we have
not focus on that because one of the

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:32.000
not focus on that because one of the
 

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.750
not focus on that because one of the
reasons is we're looking at majority of

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:34.760
reasons is we're looking at majority of
 

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.670
reasons is we're looking at majority of
the Asian populations are foreign-born

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:36.680
the Asian populations are foreign-born
 

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:40.090
