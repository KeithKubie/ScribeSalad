00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:09.164
Where does bread get its fluffiness?

00:00:09.164 --> 00:00:11.063
Swiss cheese its holes?

00:00:11.063 --> 00:00:13.670
And what makes vinegar so sour?

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.116
These foods may taste 
completely different,

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:21.299
but all of these phenomena come from
tiny organisms chowing down on sugar

00:00:21.299 --> 00:00:24.453
and belching up some culinary byproducts.

00:00:24.453 --> 00:00:26.960
Let's start with yeast.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.241
Yeast are single-celled fungi 
used to make bread, beer, and wine,

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:33.875
among other products.

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:36.425
Yeast break down carbohydrates,
like sugar,

00:00:36.425 --> 00:00:39.741
to get energy 
and the molecules they need to function.

00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:41.673
They have two different ways to do this:

00:00:41.673 --> 00:00:44.799
the oxygen-dependent, or aerobic, pathway,

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:48.238
and the oxygen-independent, 
anaerobic pathway,

00:00:48.238 --> 00:00:50.843
which is also called fermentation.

00:00:50.843 --> 00:00:53.805
When you bake bread,
yeast can use both pathways,

00:00:53.805 --> 00:00:58.873
but they normally prefer to start with
the anaerobic process of fermentation.

00:00:58.873 --> 00:01:03.303
In this process, ethanol is produced
in addition to CO2.

00:01:03.303 --> 00:01:05.268
No, bread isn't alcoholic.

00:01:05.268 --> 00:01:09.775
Small amounts of alcohol that are secreted
evaporate during baking.

00:01:09.775 --> 00:01:12.768
In the aerobic, 
or oxygen-dependent pathway,

00:01:12.768 --> 00:01:14.638
the yeast consume some of the sugar

00:01:14.638 --> 00:01:19.658
and produce carbon dioxide gas,
or CO2, and water.

00:01:19.658 --> 00:01:24.750
In both processes, the CO2 accumulates
and creates tiny bubbles.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.085
These bubbles get trapped by gluten
and create a sponge-like structure

00:01:29.085 --> 00:01:32.302
that gives the bread its soft texture.

00:01:32.302 --> 00:01:34.426
Wine also relies on yeast.

00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:37.712
But a wine-making set-up 
keeps the oxygen levels low

00:01:37.712 --> 00:01:40.672
so that yeast consume sugar 
using fermentation,

00:01:40.672 --> 00:01:42.867
the anaerobic pathway.

00:01:42.867 --> 00:01:48.204
The process often starts with wild yeasts
already hanging out on the grapes.

00:01:48.204 --> 00:01:49.937
But to get consistent results,

00:01:49.937 --> 00:01:54.092
most winemakers also add 
carefully selected strains of yeast

00:01:54.092 --> 00:01:57.084
that can tolerate high levels of alcohol.

00:01:57.084 --> 00:01:59.630
The yeast consume the sugar
in the grape juice,

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.048
and as the sugar level drops,

00:02:01.048 --> 00:02:03.557
the alcohol level rises.

00:02:03.557 --> 00:02:07.032
This doesn't necessarily mean 
that sweeter wines have less alcohol.

00:02:07.032 --> 00:02:10.183
Different types of grapes start with
different amounts of sugar,

00:02:10.183 --> 00:02:12.120
and sugar can also be added.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.210
What happens to the carbon dioxide?

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.370
It just bubbles away through a vent.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.751
In carbonated alcoholic beverages,
like champagne and beer,

00:02:19.751 --> 00:02:23.929
sealed containers are used in primary
or secondary fermentation

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:27.183
to keep the carbon dioxide in the bottle.

00:02:27.183 --> 00:02:32.146
Wine also introduces us to our second
type of food-producing microorganism:

00:02:32.146 --> 00:02:33.386
bacteria.

00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:34.841
A special strain of bacteria

00:02:34.841 --> 00:02:39.675
turns a tart compound in grape juice
into softer tasting ones

00:02:39.675 --> 00:02:44.567
that are responsible for some of
the flavors in red wines and chardonnays.

00:02:44.567 --> 00:02:47.682
Another type of bacteria,
called acetic acid bacteria,

00:02:47.682 --> 00:02:49.809
isn't so desirable in wine,

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:51.771
but they have their function, too.

00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:53.349
If there's oxygen around,

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.548
these bacteria convert the ethanol in wine
into, well, acetic acid.

00:02:58.548 --> 00:03:02.780
Let this process continue
and you'll eventually get vinegar.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.190
Bacteria are the key for cheese, too.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.641
To make cheese, 
milk is inoculated with bacteria.

00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:13.084
The bacteria gobble up the lactose,
a kind of sugar,

00:03:13.084 --> 00:03:16.981
and produce lactic acid,
along with many other chemicals.

00:03:16.981 --> 00:03:19.998
As the milk gets more and more acidic,

00:03:19.998 --> 00:03:22.875
its proteins start to aggregate 
and curdle.

00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:26.604
That's why spoiled milk is clumpy.

00:03:26.604 --> 00:03:29.240
Cheesemakers usually add an enzyme
called rennet,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.423
naturally found inside of cows, goats,
and some other mammals

00:03:33.423 --> 00:03:35.519
to help this process along.

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.865
Eventually, those little curdles turn into
bigger curds,

00:03:38.865 --> 00:03:41.565
which are pressed 
to squeeze out the water,

00:03:41.565 --> 00:03:43.911
and create a firm cheese.

00:03:43.911 --> 00:03:47.108
Different strains of bacteria
make different kinds of cheese.

00:03:47.108 --> 00:03:51.163
For example, a species of bacteria
that emits carbon dioxide

00:03:51.163 --> 00:03:55.122
is what gives swiss cheese
its characteristic holes.

00:03:55.122 --> 00:04:00.204
Some cheeses, brie and camembert,
use another kind of microorganism, too:

00:04:00.204 --> 00:04:01.745
mold.

00:04:01.745 --> 00:04:05.961
So your kitchen functions as a sort of
biotechnology lab

00:04:05.961 --> 00:04:10.219
manned by microorganisms 
that culture your cuisine.

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:13.883
Yogurt, soy sauce, sour cream, sauerkraut,

00:04:13.883 --> 00:04:19.907
kefir, kimchi, kombucha, 
cheddar, challah, pita, and naan.

00:04:19.907 --> 00:04:22.472
But maybe not all at the same dinner.
