00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.150
I have asked you to have a look at, at Harel's original paper. In there,

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:10.030
he has several abstract diagrams laying out the various features of the state

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.430
chart notation. On the left, there is a a state machine that has three states.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.510
Notice the default state is the top one and,

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.500
with the line coming into it, and there are transitions among the states.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.590
Totally, there are six transitions there.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.340
The version on the right labeled b, okay, is a nested state transition diagram.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.980
A new state called D in the roundtangle, surrounds states A and B.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:49.160
A is still the default state for the the state machine as a whole.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.620
But notice that some of the lines come out of D

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.450
rather than coming out of either A or C. Going back to the one on the left,

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.980
notice there are two transitions labeled f, one coming out from A and

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.020
going to B, one coming out of C and going to B. On the right,

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.850
they're coming out of D. That is, there's there's a an abstraction,

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.910
saying when you leave any state in D under transition f,

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.394
you go to B. So in that case, we reduce two transitions labeled f to one.

00:01:23.394 --> 00:01:26.976
There's still the transition from A to C.

00:01:26.976 --> 00:01:32.080
There's still the transition from B to A.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.760
Notice also though that there's a transition from B to D labeled h.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.450
In this case, where does it go? Well, notice that we've added a new

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.140
default state and its transition for C. That is,

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.680
if a transition comes into D, to the border of D,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.200
where is it going to go? It's going to go to the default state, which is C.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.120
Well, this is identical to what's happening on the left where there's

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.870
a direct line from B to C. In this case the line's a little shorter, saving just

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.440
a little bit of complexity. We could also have the nesting go further.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.610
That is A or C or B could themselves have substate machines in them
