00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.190
Hey everybody thanks for tuning in to Dnews

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.200
today I'm Trace

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.530
I'm here at Lands End at the very edge of

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.040
San Francisco and it's a beautiful place

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.460
to come and see whales breaching or watch

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.180
seals but if you want to see wildlife up

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.270
close you have to go a hundred and

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.080
twenty miles south to the Monterey Bay

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.110
Aquarium so that's where we're headed

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.110
and we're going to show you some

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.150
incredible things. The California coast

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.869
is one of the most vibrant locations in

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.390
the world for marine research and

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.399
conservation efforts spanning 840 miles

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:35.840
this stretch of the coast facing the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.610
Pacific Ocean has become home to

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.030
numerous ocean research institutions

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.310
such as the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.820
researchers inside are constantly

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.929
looking forward utilizing technology and

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:48.410
new research techniques to study and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.239
protect the ocean and the people that depend on it.

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:53.140
The aquarium is located along cannery

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.399
row in Monterey California named for the

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.210
numerous sardine canneries which

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.870
operated hear from the mid eighteen

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:59.870
hundreds until the 1970s.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.090
A portal to the local wildlife and ecosystems its world acclaimed live exhibits

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.290
have a mission to inspire

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.550
ocean conservation.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.620
You are standing next to the world's first ever live kelp forest

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.970
exhibit which moves constantly to allow

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.070
the kelp survive inside the aquarium we

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.950
got a rare view of how they do this.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.000
Now you're standing above the kelp forest

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.510
exhibit just your left you'll notice a

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.870
pendulum-like of device that device is

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.150
actually forcing water up and down along

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.950
a chamber sending pulses into the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.930
exhibits to simulate the ebb and flow of

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.210
the ocean. It's one thing to see it from

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.020
the surface but underwater you get a

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.280
real feel for the movement of the ocean.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.630
Look around and you'll notice leopard

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.610
sharks, rockfish, giant kelp, and maybe even

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.210
spot a juvenile giant sea bass.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.200
Across the aquarium is the open sea exhibit its 1.2 million gallons of water

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.280
is home to marine species that are more common

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.920
beyond our coastline in the featureless open ocean.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.940
Each species in the open sea requires a specific diet and higher

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.360
temperature waters to replicate their natural environment.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.339
This exhibit houses yellowfin tuna, bonito, scalloped hammerheads,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.460
pelagic rays, and more than 30,000 sardines -- a nod to the Cannery's past.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.100
If you look down, you'll see a massive green sea turtle weighing around 300 lbs!

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.810
Smaller fish such as these look downs

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.970
thrive in a much smaller exhibit

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:46.959
These fish swim

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.939
all day and night because they don't

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.470
sleep like land animals. Instead they lower

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.540
their metabolism to rest rather

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.269
than slipping into a dormant state like

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:56.980
you and me. Another reason they

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.860
never stop is they need to move to breathe

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.420
you may even catch a quick glimpse of

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.370
one of the lookdowns gills as they zip

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.290
past you. Their gills gather oxygen collected

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.810
from all the sea water flowing through

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.110
their mouths allowing them to breathe.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.680
You are now surrounded by sea nettle jellyfish

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.040
normally if you were this close you'd feel a slight stingy sensation. The stingers are on the tentacles

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.739
trailing behind the jellyfish and

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.560
would feel painful if touched but not nearly as much

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.310
as say a bee sting. As the bell of the

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.549
jellyfish's pulses it could move slowly through the water

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.209
creating water currents that help it gather

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.169
passing food. As large plankton, jellies actually rely heavily

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.449
on ocean currents to move them for longer distances.

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.319
All of these exhibits are made possible by

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.580
marine researchers, animal caregivers,

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.419
expert divers and enthusiastic

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:52.889
volunteers who like millions of humans

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.549
before them have fallen in love with the sea.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.200
Guys this place is incredible I've

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.750
never been able to go behind the scenes

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.209
and exhibits like that I hope you all

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.840
enjoyed it as much as I obviously did

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.400
but now let's head back up to San

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.400
Francisco

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.080
The Monterey Bay Aquarium, like other aquarium and marine research institutions around the world

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.080
are constantly tinkering with methods and technology

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.080
to study and protect marine wildlife.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.380
In fact, the future of ocean conservation is propelled forward with technological innovations.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:32.360
From autonomous ships, which will limit ocean pollution to the automation and sustainable practice of fish farming,

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.720
each step along the way will benefit from marine researchers considering the new possible.
