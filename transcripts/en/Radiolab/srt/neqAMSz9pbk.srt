1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,040
Hey I'm Jad Abumrad, I am Robert
Kobish this is Radiolab and today

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,340
things, and I just, I wanted to check
in. This is the usual radio lab style,

3
00:00:09,341 --> 00:00:12,220
which means that I can
basically natter on forever.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,150
All right, so this is Alison Gopnik.

5
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:18,690
She's a professor of psychology and
philosophy at the University of California

6
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:21,930
at Berkeley and the author
of the philosophical baby.

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,850
And the reason we called
her up is that, you know,

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,440
truthfully after the egg situation,
we broken egg to make this program.

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,340
And if you're just joining us, we
weren't planning to, it just happened.

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,110
We feel really crappy
about it frankly. But, um,

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,340
you got us thinking about the fragility
of objects and for me that call to mind,

12
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,780
um, an idea that I've always been
thinking about, uh, you know,

13
00:00:41,781 --> 00:00:44,870
being the father of two young
kids about object permanence,

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,240
which is this whole idea in a child's
psychology that when babies are really

15
00:00:50,241 --> 00:00:54,110
young, when an object
disappears from their view,

16
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,670
they think it's gone forever. So
that's the peekaboo game. Exactly.

17
00:00:58,671 --> 00:01:01,610
It's what makes it fun because like
from their perspective thought is you're

18
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:06,200
gone forever and then you're back and
you're gone forever and then you're back.

19
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,890
So, uh, I thought this would be a
cool idea for us to explore about how,

20
00:01:09,891 --> 00:01:10,940
like from the very beginning,

21
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,000
we're born with no concept that
objects should stick around.

22
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:18,350
But when we talked with Alison Gopnik,
the first thing she told us was that, uh,

23
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,620
well, it's, it's a little
more complicated than that.

24
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,580
Of course, right? It's science.

25
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,850
And so we got into a conversation
that went in some strange directions,

26
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:32,030
but she began by telling
us about some new research,

27
00:01:32,031 --> 00:01:35,870
which shows that actually babies do
have an idea that objects stick around.

28
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:36,980
You know,

29
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,680
if you do these experiments where you
show them an object behind a screen and

30
00:01:39,681 --> 00:01:44,450
then you make disappear, they think,
Whoa, where did it go? It should be there.

31
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,860
Exactly. Whoa. You know,

32
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:50,790
the wo because babies look much longer
at things that they don't expect it or

33
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:55,700
surprising. It's as if they're sitting
there saying, you know, what's the, um,

34
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,990
they very rarely finish,
right? So I was wrong,

35
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:03,180
fine. But here's the
really surprising thing.

36
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,560
Now suppose what happens is a yellow duck
goes behind the screen moving left to

37
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:10,530
right and then out the other
side instead of the yellow duck,

38
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,200
there's a little blue
bunny. No, most adults,

39
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:15,510
if they saw this would be like what the,

40
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,300
but the babies are totally
blahzay about that.

41
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,880
What if a yellow duck goes in one side
of the screen and then magically the blue

42
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,840
doc appears on the other side of the
screen until they're about a year old.

43
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,930
Babies don't seem to be fazed by that.

44
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,340
And she suspects that the reason for that
is that the most important thing about

45
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:39,270
the duck to the babies is not that
it is yellow or round or duck.

46
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:44,010
Like in any way it was its trajectory,
its story, what it did in the past,

47
00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:45,390
what its history is like.

48
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,570
This is an object that was moving left
to right and when it emerged from the

49
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:51,300
screen it was still an
object moving left to right.

50
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,160
And there are experiments with
adults that are kind of amazing,

51
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,050
where you sort of see the same thing.

52
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,720
You take a room full of divide
them in half. You say, okay,

53
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,160
everybody on the left, half of the
room is now going to get a, you know,

54
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,210
university kept California at Berkeley
Mug and then you say to them, all right,

55
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,510
all of you guys who have a Mug, how
much would you sell your monk for?

56
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,330
And then you ask the people on
the other side of the class,

57
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,400
how much would you pay to buy that Mug?

58
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:21,190
And you get people to write it
down on a piece of paper. Well,

59
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:25,600
it turns out the people who actually
already have the Mug on their desk think

60
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:28,990
that it's much more valuable than the
people on the other side. So they,

61
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,770
they would demand much more for their mug.

62
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,280
Keep in mind they've only
spent one minute with this Mug,

63
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,390
but somehow over that minute she says
the Mug gets imbued with something,

64
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,710
some kind of essence.

65
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,670
There's something, and again, you
can see this even with children,

66
00:03:44,671 --> 00:03:47,730
there's something about mindness,
there's something about possession.

67
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,720
About the relationship that I have to
the objects that I care about that goes

68
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:55,440
beyond just what their
superficial features are.

69
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,990
Oh, I think that makes such
deeply obvious sense to me.

70
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,240
I'm surprised that it
was even in discovery.

71
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,720
If I have a relationship
with the thing like, ah,

72
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,990
I'm going to see my girlfriend and the
railroad man gives me the ticket and it

73
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:12,370
turns out to be a fabulous date.

74
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,600
Then I put the ticket in my pocket
and I saved the ticket for 40 years.

75
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,340
Anytime I want to go back to the
day that I had the great date,

76
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,720
I just touched the ticket.

77
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,780
Yeah. I don't have that at all. You
don't have that at all? Well, no.

78
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,710
I have it a little bit, but I
just know I s I throw it I, yeah,

79
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,490
you throw them away. Hey, throw them
away. You got a purge man. You know,

80
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:38,470
some of us are more sentimental about
the past and about objects than than

81
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:42,220
others are, and she says,
ah. Interestingly, that
for those Weirdos like you,

82
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:45,760
Robert who gets super
romantic about there's things,

83
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,640
there might be a deep
evolutionary reason for it.

84
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,580
Now you always have to take these
evolutionary reasons with a grain of salt.

85
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:56,050
But she says if you look
at patterns of passion,

86
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:58,360
for example, is what it's
called in biology. You know,

87
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,390
like the squirrel who hides is nuts. Um,

88
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,180
the squirrels keep really good track
of which nuts they have and what their

89
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:05,014
histories are.

90
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,550
And one possibility is that some of our
relationship about at least physical

91
00:05:09,551 --> 00:05:14,551
objects stems from this history of the
history of being mammals who keep track

92
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:19,630
of what we've got and what we don't
have. It's my inner squirrel. Right?

93
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,720
You know, we do talk about
people squirreling things away.

94
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,860
Is there something that's got this kind
of deeper evolutionary background and I

95
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:28,520
think there is some evidence that,

96
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,820
but isn't there also like a
counter squirrel instinct?

97
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:35,290
I mean like there's that famous thing
with observation that young male baboons

98
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:38,830
when they get to a certain age will
get gripped by wanderlust and then just

99
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:43,150
wander away from the troop. And which
is good because it prevents inbreeding.

100
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:43,810
Yeah.

101
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,490
I think there is actually reason to
think that we all live on this kind of

102
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,270
emotional, bungee cord, you know, boiling
between the Squirrel and the baboon.

103
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,440
And she says it's interesting to think
about like what's gonna Happen to our bun

104
00:05:56,441 --> 00:06:00,950
genus now that we're entering a
world where objects are becoming just

105
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:01,784
information.

106
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,960
What will happen when we have three d
printers that are going to be like the

107
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:10,850
replicators on Star Trek that can,
uh, just keep producing replicas of,

108
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,330
of objects might actually mess with
some of our most basic instincts.

109
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:18,800
Philosophers, philosophers are always
great about having wonderful, crazy, um,

110
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,140
thought experiments to
try to demonstrate this.

111
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:25,780
So one of them is the swamp man.
It's a famous thought experiment,

112
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,560
not exactly clear why it's a swamp
man and not some other kind of man.

113
00:06:29,561 --> 00:06:32,830
But here's how it goes. Here's
the story of the swamp, man.

114
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,420
Magine you're standing next to a swamp,

115
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:39,130
you're you and in the swamp it's a bunch
of bubbling gases, chemical reactions,

116
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,040
bubbling and interacting
in some weird organic way.

117
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,930
But whatever you just
standing there, but then,

118
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:46,210
okay,

119
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,400
a bolt of lightning comes out of
the sky and kills you and that,

120
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,320
oh, the other one comes out
of the sky, hits the swamp,

121
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,830
catalyzing all that chemistry into
overdrive and somehow miraculously,

122
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,100
for just a moment, the reactions come
together and just the right way to form.

123
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,740
Hi, I'm Robert. Oh Man.
Completely identical to you,

124
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:08,900
Robert, Robert, and brand new you.

125
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,100
If you took every single
molecule in the swamp man's body,

126
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,330
it would be exactly like yours at this
very moment. So here's the question.

127
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,360
Does swamp Robert Remember that date or
does swamp Robert Care about the ticket?

128
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,520
You're saying that swamp gas rubber
is molecule for molecule Adam for Adam

129
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,330
molecule for molecule. This Robert
Right here. Exactly. So you're saying,

130
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:36,620
are the memories and experiences of his
life suddenly contained in that facts?

131
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:41,540
Emily, that's the question. And
most people's intuition is no, no,

132
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,550
absolutely not. Absolutely not. I'm
not even hesitated. Why? Why not?

133
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Why didn't I believe that my date and
the ticket that took me to that date,

134
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,680
they belong to me and not to Adams and,

135
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:58,160
but I don't have you asked me what's
the difference between me and my Adams?

136
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,130
I don't know, but I know
it's there. Right? Well,

137
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:05,510
because the atoms have you sitting
right there actually went on that date.

138
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,810
Where's the atoms of swamp gas?
Robert weren't there. Right?

139
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,720
You think you got it? Exactly right.
Yet it's something about the history.

140
00:08:11,721 --> 00:08:15,380
It's the fact that, you know, Robert's
Adam's really were in that place.

141
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:19,550
They really were there with that
person. And, um, although I could,

142
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,360
I could tell a version of the swamp
gas Robert that would, I think,

143
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:25,600
solve this problem if Robert, this
Robert instead of the lightning,

144
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:28,600
he just got into the
swamp, submerged himself,

145
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,070
commingled his Adams with the swamp
gas Adams, and then he got out,

146
00:08:33,071 --> 00:08:37,390
went on his way. If then later,
even like years later, the swamp,

147
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,990
I'm Robert spat out of copy.

148
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,760
The fact that the real Robert was there
to begin with and that the copy somehow

149
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,640
touched on almost like a baton passing.

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,010
I could see that the date
would be in the copy.

151
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,940
I think you might be [inaudible] or
do you get with me? I think I'm right.

152
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,580
I've always it to myself

153
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,250
with you list a sense of touch that is,

154
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,410
my wife has a very different
view of this to me,

155
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:04,440
but I one day was sitting
around in the office,

156
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,820
get a letter unbidden from the first
man on the moon from Neil Armstrong.

157
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,670
Just write something about I written,

158
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,870
he sort of who you got to do it and it
says commander Neil Armstrong and it's

159
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:17,100
very flattering. And if it
had come in any other form,

160
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:19,800
but by email I would've framed it.

161
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,830
I would've given it a
special place of honor.

162
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:28,070
But since it arrived from a machine to
my machine and then out of a machine to

163
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:32,820
another machine to a flat piece of
paper, you can't give it to thank here.

164
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,440
Give it to the ticket to the deep
thing. Huh? Can't, that's weird.

165
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,820
Why? Because Neil Armstrong
never touched it. [inaudible]

166
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,160
yeah, but you and I are old
Roberts, so maybe that's

167
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:49,110
no, well, yeah. So, so Chad, you
don't have that feeling? Well, no.

168
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,060
The moment you said it, I thought I was,

169
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,960
I was constructing an image in my mind
of Neil Armstrong at a computer touching

170
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:59,961
the keyboard and there is an unbridgeable
gulf between his fingers and that

171
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:05,700
paper you're holding, they never
actually touched each other.

172
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,890
I mean if you think about it as
touch, then you're right. I guess he,

173
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:12,810
he's now dead. And I think if
just touching the paper, he would,

174
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,290
he would just be a little, I don't know,

175
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:20,010
a closer somehow.

176
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,750
It's a funny tension I
think because you know what?

177
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:29,260
Both science and at least
some philosophical and even
religious traditions tell

178
00:10:29,451 --> 00:10:33,750
us is that the world is impermanent.
Nothing in it stays the same. Our, our,

179
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,260
we don't stay the same. Our
bodies don't stay the same.

180
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,780
The people that we love and the
things we love don't stay the same.

181
00:10:38,781 --> 00:10:41,840
That's just the truth of the matter is
that there's this constant impermanence

182
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,310
and this constant flux and some
philosophers have argued over the years,

183
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,790
we should just embrace that we
would be freer if we didn't,

184
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,140
if we didn't try to hold
that flux for a moment.

185
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,450
I have to say my feeling about it is
part of what makes everything so precious

186
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:03,200
to us is exactly the fact that
we know it's going to disappear.

187
00:11:03,201 --> 00:11:05,390
We know it's impermanent,
we know it won't last,

188
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:09,860
but what we love is this thing
now. We love our I. For me,

189
00:11:09,861 --> 00:11:13,510
the most dramatic example of this is our
relationship to our children. So yeah,

190
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,920
we know they're going to go. We know
that in 20 years from now, if we,

191
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,100
they treat us with affectionate
contempt will be doing really well,

192
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:25,490
but that doesn't change the fact that
right now it's this child and not any

193
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:30,910
other child in the universe just
do this one. And I think that's,

194
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,170
there's something really deep and profound
about our human lives that the fact

195
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:37,870
that we can do both of those things.
We recognize the impermanence,

196
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:42,871
but that we feel the attachments that
that seems to me to give our life its its

197
00:11:43,211 --> 00:11:44,620
very special texture.

198
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,080
Wow. That's exactly, I could
just put that whole thing.

199
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:50,170
You just hit it in the frame,
right. Just bow down. Yeah.

200
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,980
People don't bow too soon friend, because

201
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,820
the next segment, uh, is going to hurt.

202
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,720
It's going to hurt and it's a Tamar
wind is blowing. That's all I'll say.

203
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:09,620
[inaudible].
