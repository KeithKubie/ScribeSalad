1
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.740
Listening to radiolab radio from W. N y.

2
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.040
S. T. E. N. D. O. N. P. R. Okay.

3
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.960
I want to start the show today with a truly remarkable story,

4
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.270
which begins with this girl right here. Hello. I, I'm her Buxton.

5
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.620
Laura Buxton is her name. Remember that name sometime of hip hop and Laura,

6
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.650
let's do this like a movie. Okay. I can move it. Yeah. Okay.

7
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.840
Okay. It's June, 2001 yeah. Where are we? Oh,

8
00:00:31.841 --> 00:00:35.740
we're in a little town in northern England called Daikon Tran Stoke on Trent.

9
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.380
There is Laura Buxton standing in her front yard. She is 10 years old,

10
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.290
well almost 10 whatever. She's a tall girl,

11
00:00:44.291 --> 00:00:49.291
pretty tall for my age pigtails and in her hand she's holding a balloon.

12
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.580
A red balloon. You with me so far? Yup. She has written her name on the balloon.

13
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.560
Please return to Laura books then and then on the other side it had my address.

14
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.280
So there she is standing in the front yard with their balloon was very Wendy and

15
00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:09.100
she holds her balloon up to the sky, to the heavens.

16
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.490
And I just let it go with the wind too.

17
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.470
Laughing and joking because we just thought it got stuck in a tree a bit further

18
00:01:19.471 --> 00:01:22.860
down the road somewhere. That's not what happened. The balloon kept going.

19
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.690
All right, now I'm looking at a map here of England and stuff on transit.

20
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.640
The tops of the balloon would have had to go south,

21
00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:34.290
like pound down down past Stratford. Yeah, past while sail past Wolverhampton,

22
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.303
then pass

23
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.800
Birmingham Pass Kidderminster Porchester pass millions of people shutting him.

24
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.400
People with different lives, different names, glove, Chester, Gloucester,

25
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.680
Gluster and all in all the red balloon goes about 140 miles south.

26
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.170
Exactly against the pervading wind, which is the southwest.

27
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.170
Finally, when this balloon is all the way on the other side of the country,

28
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.980
it begins to descend down, down, down,

29
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.110
and of all the places that could have landed, you know, in a river in effect,

30
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.480
three parking lot in the sea.

31
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.870
Instead the balloon touches down in the yard of this girl I live,

32
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.050
I live in the countryside in a little village called Melton little bone.

33
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.730
Just so you're not confused. This is a different girl than the first one.

34
00:02:21.731 --> 00:02:24.610
They do sound the same, but they live on opposite ends of the country.

35
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.310
The building got stuck in our hedge,

36
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.980
but our next door neighbor found it and he thought it was just a bit of rubbish

37
00:02:29.981 --> 00:02:31.030
and he collected it up.

38
00:02:31.031 --> 00:02:34.390
Say the cows wouldn't eat it because he didn't want the cows to like choke on

39
00:02:34.391 --> 00:02:37.750
the rubbish. And he was about to put in the bin like literally.

40
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.440
And then he saw the label thing, please send back to Nora Buxton.

41
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.270
And he was like, oh my God, why did he say,

42
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.220
Oh my God. Okay, so check this out.

43
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.910
Remember I told you how the first girl who sent the balloon was 10 the second

44
00:02:51.911 --> 00:02:56.830
girl who received it in 10 years old. She's 10. Okay. Okay. No, wait,

45
00:02:56.831 --> 00:03:00.940
there's more. Remember how I told her the first name was Laura Buxton?

46
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.650
Yeah. Well girl number two. Can you introduce yourself? Okay. Um, hi,

47
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:09.190
I'm Laura Buxton. What girl number one.

48
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.790
[inaudible]. They're both Fluoro Buxton. Yeah, no, both named Laura Buxton.

49
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.720
Yes. You heard me right?

50
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.570
A 10 year old girl named Laura Buxton. Let's go have a balloon.

51
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.320
That balloon floats 140 miles and lands in the yard of another 10 year old girl

52
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.060
named Laura Buxton. Is this for real? Yes.

53
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.020
I think it might be the strangest thing I've ever heard in my life.

54
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.200
It's pretty weird. So weird. We had to get them both into a studio.

55
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.430
So like we're going to hear Americans through these.

56
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.920
This balloon thing happened about eight years ago,

57
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:48.670
so both Loras are now 18 and they've actually become really good friends.

58
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.590
Anyhow, back to the story. I got the balloon. That's Lauren number two.

59
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.080
What did you think at that point? Um, well I,

60
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.240
I was quite young so I didn't really know what to think. I was just like,

61
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.250
I better write the letter because you know, there's someone else out like, oh,

62
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:05.740
Laura Bucks and I must see them.

63
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.540
So Laura number two wrote a letter to learn number one. Laura,

64
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.553
I think I put,

65
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.730
I'm 10 years old and I live in Welch and I found here prolene and thing is that

66
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.890
my name is Laura Buxton as well.

67
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.220
So lots of love from Lauren Buxton learn number one,

68
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.840
you get the notes through the post

69
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.070
opened up while I was in the kitchen and it was really quite confusing actually.

70
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.790
Okay. A short while later, the two Laura's meeting.

71
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.890
Then at that moment things get even weirder.

72
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.880
They realize when they see each other for the first time, oh my God.

73
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.020
Not only do we have the same name and are the same age, but we look the same,

74
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.320
same height, any and tall and same color hair on his hair.

75
00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:51.340
And I remember the weirdest thing was that we were wearing really similar clays,

76
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.000
which I was taught. It was just so weird. What were you wearing?

77
00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:57.060
Do you remember? Paint John Person.

78
00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.070
Jean both had on pink jumpers and jeans and as they started to talk it just kept

79
00:05:02.681 --> 00:05:05.200
getting weird. They've got a three year old black Labrador.

80
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.460
We both got a gray rabbit.

81
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.840
We both got Guinea pigs and they both brought their Guinea pigs with them that

82
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.900
day.

83
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.250
I remember lower t cause out of its cage and I had mind on my lap and we were

84
00:05:15.251 --> 00:05:16.690
like, oh my God.

85
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.670
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

86
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.330
<v 2>they were identical. They look Brown,</v>

87
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.600
but this sort of Beigey orange patch on the bottom,

88
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.400
like completely the same. I was just like,

89
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.050
oh my gosh, how is this happening?

90
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.340
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

91
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.200
<v 2>do you believe miracles either of you as a name? Would you call this miracle?</v>

92
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.460
I'm not sure. I mean I guess it could be, but I think it's more of a case fee.

93
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.670
Yeah, I'd say it's more faith than American,

94
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.760
so you don't think that when the blue, the balloon was just went well.

95
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.480
If it was just wind, it was a very, very lucky wind.

96
00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.050
The trans is just so likely. There be some kind of reason.

97
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.680
What kind of reason maybe we were meant to meet, I dunno,

98
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.620
but meant by who or what.

99
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.540
I mean, only time will tell.

100
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:14.810
It could actually be like preparedness for something else later in life.

101
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.360
Two days in Maryland. Grannies right out.

102
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.660
Just young and renters didn't drink ted.

103
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.823
I mean,

104
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.540
<v 0>okay, what are you? Look what your, your you know what you are, what?</v>

105
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.870
You're a destiny bully if you don't like cause like what do you bear?

106
00:06:30.871 --> 00:06:34.800
You call me a Destiny's bully. Yes, because power band or something. No,

107
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.360
it's what you're doing to those girls.

108
00:06:36.361 --> 00:06:40.650
You want them to act like they are somehow the subject of a miracle. No,

109
00:06:40.651 --> 00:06:43.200
I wasn't trying to force God on them. If that's what you mean. Yes you are.

110
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.280
You're the one who says, oh who's behind? No.

111
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:50.010
The question I was trying to get at is like how should we think about that

112
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:50.850
story?

113
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:55.850
Do we live in a world where there's magic and meaning or is it all just chance?

114
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:59.370
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

115
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.570
<v 0>in fact, that's what we're going to do with this whole hour and radio.</v>

116
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.070
Everything you've discussed, the role that chance plays in so many things.

117
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.980
Things like lottery tickets, sports coin flips,

118
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:12.210
even the cells inside our own body. You know what,

119
00:07:12.211 --> 00:07:15.630
actually we could upgrade the whole thing and give the show a fancier name.

120
00:07:15.631 --> 00:07:19.880
I've got a five syllable word that means randomness. Bring it three Latin name.

121
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:25.160
[inaudible] stochasticity skip this city.

122
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.790
I'm Jabbing Ron. I am Robert Krulwich. Stay with us.

123
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.213
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

124
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.560
<v 0>so let's start with a very basic question.</v>

125
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:38.150
Let's a random sounds like it means random. That is,

126
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.120
anything can happen at the next turn of the wheel.

127
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.140
Like your phone ringing for example. Random. Sorry.

128
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:47.000
Although it happened so many times, they just no longer ran.

129
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.820
<v 4>Yeah, it's completely predictable,</v>

130
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:51.900
but it does have a very nice kind of built to it though.

131
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.740
Do you think I'm going to sing with it now

132
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.320
<v 0>and now back to our regularly scheduled program.</v>

133
00:08:11.321 --> 00:08:16.140
So let me say that something remarkable happens like Dolores, like Dolores.

134
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:20.140
Can you tell whether this is just a random act of a,

135
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:25.270
of an indifferent universe or is there something truly miraculous and wonderful

136
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.310
about it? Excellent question. Thank you very much.

137
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.010
And it's a question that took us to Berkeley, California.

138
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:35.920
I'm Devin Nolan. I'm a professor of statistics at the University of California,

139
00:08:35.921 --> 00:08:36.470
Berkeley,

140
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.460
and the reason we'd come to see Deb Nolan at Berkeley is because we'd heard that

141
00:08:39.461 --> 00:08:40.450
she plays this game.

142
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.080
I like to incorporate lots of classroom activities and demos,

143
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:47.290
one in particular that has to do with a randomness to game that helps your

144
00:08:47.291 --> 00:08:51.100
students understand what real randomness actually looks like.

145
00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.950
That doesn't look like what you would think we call this. In any case,

146
00:08:56.030 --> 00:09:00.750
it takes us into your classroom in a few stints and she sits us down.

147
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:05.970
We all sit down. We sit in there in a semicircle and then she explains,

148
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.820
okay, I'm going to divide the group up into two.

149
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.170
I'm going to divide it right here.

150
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.320
She splits us up to the group one and three of her students, Joe Chang,

151
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.320
Richard Liang, Margaret Taub group two Jad Abumrad,

152
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.220
Robert Krulwich is that spend in the group here. She's pointing it up.

153
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:25.250
I'm going to give you a penny and I'm going to ask you to flip the coin a

154
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:29.520
hundred times and the three of you, she points to her students.

155
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.490
Your job is to pretend to flip a coin,

156
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.380
meaning they just have to flip the coin in their heads.

157
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.750
How do you think that coin might land?

158
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:41.780
Produce a hundred fake coin flips and then Deb leaves the room.

159
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.700
So where students start whipping through their imaginary fake flips, sails,

160
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:56.010
tails, heads, tails, Wiley.

161
00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:02.460
<v 5>They actually flipped a hundred times. Heads,</v>

162
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:09.230
<v 0>tails, tails, tails, tails,</v>

163
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.050
tails, heads.

164
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:18.430
But eventually we did finish it and both groups then put our strings of ancient

165
00:10:18.431 --> 00:10:20.230
keys right there on blackboard.

166
00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:27.010
And then Deb came back. Hello. Here they are. Huh?

167
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.393
<v 5>Look,</v>

168
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.760
<v 0>okay. So on the board you've got two sets of H's and t's,</v>

169
00:10:34.761 --> 00:10:39.710
which looked pretty much the same to us. But she looked at their list,

170
00:10:39.711 --> 00:10:43.730
the fakers, and then she looked at our list and right away she says,

171
00:10:43.731 --> 00:10:48.260
pointing at our list. This is the real one. We were like, ah,

172
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:51.200
what? How did she do that? Well,

173
00:10:51.201 --> 00:10:55.650
amazingly the way she knew had to do with one particular moment. Right.

174
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.350
Roll the tape back to a moment. Right at the beginning of it,

175
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.263
<v 5>our coin,</v>

176
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.173
three in a row,

177
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.880
we have way too many details.

178
00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:25.903
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

179
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:35.120
Seven days in a row. It was really spooky.

180
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:38.480
Completely. Like at any moment a unicorn was going to come Gallup again.

181
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.370
That's how weird it was, but has magical and unbranded as it felt to us.

182
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.770
That's how she knew that we were the real flippers.

183
00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:50.860
As soon as I saw the seven tails and then I looked over to the other board and

184
00:11:50.931 --> 00:11:53.000
there weren't any longer than,

185
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.560
I think that's how she knew when we asked one of the guys on the other team,

186
00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:01.000
why didn't you put more streaks in your flips? Um, well he said, well,

187
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.460
I think we'd all say, I was thinking if we did that too much,

188
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.580
maybe it should recognize that we were actually doing that on purpose.

189
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.700
In other words, those streaks just feel wrong.

190
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.510
And that's the thing about randomness. Real randomness.

191
00:12:13.511 --> 00:12:16.270
When you see it just doesn't feel random enough.

192
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:19.140
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

193
00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:23.370
<v 0>Bob says that the truth is strange things do happen by chance.</v>

194
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:30.640
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

195
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.880
<v 0>why is this hard for us to emotionally accept this? Well,</v>

196
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:37.300
it finally made sense was when we spoke to this guy, Chad, I Robert,

197
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:38.650
that's Jake Koehler.

198
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.160
I'm a professor of finance and professor of law at Arizona State University.

199
00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.300
So here's how the epiphany happened.

200
00:12:43.301 --> 00:12:46.820
We were explaining to Jay the Unicorn experience at Deb's classroom.

201
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.780
We've got one tail and we've got a second, then we've got a third,

202
00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:53.170
then we got to seven in somewhere in the conversation we started to do the math.

203
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.530
Okay, what actually are the odds? Let me see. It was it heads in a row,

204
00:12:56.531 --> 00:12:59.080
tails in a row, pale seven tails in a row.

205
00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.930
That's one half raised to the seventh power.

206
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:06.040
So we started to do the calculations and at first look pretty good,

207
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.200
chip 0.0 the little more than 1% just over 1% chance. Yeah.

208
00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:15.220
So it seemed to first that what had had happened in Deb's class was super

209
00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:16.330
unlikely. Right?

210
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:21.360
But then Soren producers had to go and say this,

211
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.970
to be fair, you should tell him that you actually flip the coin a hundred times.

212
00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:30.100
Oh, now wait, wait. Did you, you were holding back on me. Wait, wait,

213
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.160
no. That's why we have sorn here.

214
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.040
Are you saying that somewhere in the a hundred flips you've gotta run up seven?

215
00:13:36.041 --> 00:13:38.950
That's what we're saying. That's not a particularly good coincidence.

216
00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:42.490
I'm sorry to burst the bucket, you mean? And then Jay explained it to us.

217
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:47.730
Uh, if you're just doing seven flips, then yeah,

218
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.790
getting seven in a row is really unlikely.

219
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.600
But if you're doing multiple sets of seven, 14 of those sets of seven,

220
00:13:54.601 --> 00:13:55.260
which we work,

221
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.680
we were doing a hundred then the profitability starts to add up and start small

222
00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:02.040
like 1% if not one becomes two, which should become score,

223
00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:04.140
which becomes eight until when it's all said and done,

224
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:09.410
the chances of getting seven tales neuro somewhere in a set of a hundred is

225
00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:15.710
don't hold your breath about one in six chance, one in six.

226
00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.100
That's it. That you would have gotten a string of seven.

227
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:24.440
So what felt spooky and almost twilight zone ish in the moment is actually

228
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.520
probable. Oh, see, that's why you don't want to know it.

229
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:31.670
It doesn't confirm your goosebumps. No, I think the goosebumps are dead now.

230
00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:35.240
Oh, I'm sorry to do that. I still enjoy life.

231
00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:41.000
The problem says that we were so focused on those seven flips in a row.

232
00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.200
We'd forgotten about the other 93 that weren't seven in a row.

233
00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:50.150
We'd forgotten about what he calls the background. We were too zoomed in.

234
00:14:50.151 --> 00:14:54.530
So you've got to back the camera up and pan around and look at the complete

235
00:14:54.531 --> 00:14:56.690
sample space. And when you do that, he says,

236
00:14:56.691 --> 00:15:00.110
what you will realize is that the thing that felt so special,

237
00:15:00.111 --> 00:15:03.560
suddenly you see that it's not so odd and it's real context.

238
00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:08.330
And this sad lesson goes way beyond coins. He gave us this example,

239
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:13.360
1985 and 1986 Evelyn Adams of New Jersey wins the lottery twice back to back of

240
00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:19.280
years. Crazily improbable, right? So if you zoom in all the way in,

241
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:20.683
there she is.

242
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.990
Evelyn Adams standing outside of a convenience store somewhere in New Jersey.

243
00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.173
<v 5>Hi.</v>

244
00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:30.280
<v 0>She is completely blown away for good reason.</v>

245
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.980
The opposite that those two particular tickets would become winning lottery

246
00:15:33.981 --> 00:15:36.680
tickets are one in 17 point 3 trillion out,

247
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:41.270
but Jay would say if you pan the camera back way from Madeline,

248
00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:47.510
if you look at the old world of people buying lottery tickets at this vantage

249
00:15:47.511 --> 00:15:50.300
point, you can begin to ask a different question.

250
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.280
What are the odds that somebody somewhere,

251
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:56.360
somebody somewhere win a lottery twice and in fact,

252
00:15:56.361 --> 00:15:59.870
the answer to that is it would be very surprising if it didn't happen repeatedly

253
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:03.440
and it has happened repeatedly really. For instance, in Connecticut,

254
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.190
employees have a place called the shuttle meadow country club.

255
00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:08.960
They won twice a man in Pennsylvania.

256
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.300
He won twice a few years later in California,

257
00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:16.910
retiree on a fantasy five and the super lotto in the same day

258
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.500
that were calculated one in 23 point 5 trillion

259
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.630
that's trillion with a t one way I think to to think about this whole thing.

260
00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:28.730
I think one example that sort of brings it all home,

261
00:16:28.731 --> 00:16:32.510
at least it did for me when I thought about the blade in the grass paradox.

262
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:37.940
The Golfer hits the ball down the fairway and the ball lands on a particular

263
00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:42.270
blade of grass. If the blade of grass could talk, you know, the,

264
00:16:42.271 --> 00:16:45.200
the blade of grass would say, wow God,

265
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:50.230
what are the odds that that ball out of all the billions of blades of grass and

266
00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:55.280
me, it lands on me? How did it come to be? That just landed on me? I don't know.

267
00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:59.270
It's sort of like a miracle and it is sort of miraculous,

268
00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:02.780
but what we know is that it was going to land on some blade of grass somewhere.

269
00:17:02.781 --> 00:17:06.170
So it's nearly a hundred percent chance that some blade of grass was going to

270
00:17:06.171 --> 00:17:08.690
say, wow, what are the odds that that ball was going to land on me?

271
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:13.040
And if I were that blade of grass, I'd feel so special and chosen and crushed

272
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.650
soar. The real lesson here,

273
00:17:17.651 --> 00:17:21.010
according to Jay Kohler and also Deb Nolan before him,

274
00:17:21.011 --> 00:17:24.340
is that if you don't see past yourself,

275
00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:29.200
you fall prey to, you know, superstition or magical thinking.

276
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.950
You have to be careful that you're not finding meaning here. When,

277
00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:36.370
when it's just coincidence as coincidence, just coincidence.

278
00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:41.720
But there are some things like the Loras that will never feel like just

279
00:17:42.161 --> 00:17:46.210
coincidence. It was just wind. It was a very, very lucky wind.

280
00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:52.290
So we had the ask. I asked you sir, is this a miracle?

281
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.470
This is not a miracle. It's a good story. But you know,

282
00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.870
there are lots of little things I could pick at in the store, you know. Exactly.

283
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.490
Pick away. Well, I mean, you know, Laura Buxton didn't find the balloons.

284
00:18:02.491 --> 00:18:06.810
Somebody else who knew a Laura Buxton found the below you selected out the

285
00:18:06.811 --> 00:18:08.310
features that match and trust me,

286
00:18:08.311 --> 00:18:10.860
somebody checked to see if she wasn't identical twin. It's a no, no,

287
00:18:10.861 --> 00:18:13.320
that's not a good one. Skip the twin. Okay. How many brothers and sisters? Oh,

288
00:18:13.321 --> 00:18:16.140
not the same number, bro. Skip that. Ah, they both have a rabbit.

289
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:21.090
Let's put that one in the story to be totally honest. He's, he's right. Well,

290
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.970
I uh, when I was interviewing Dolores, I asked him a bunch of questions,

291
00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:28.200
kinda scouting for similarities. It's your favorite color, both of you pink.

292
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:31.260
Scrap that. And what do you guys study in school? Biology, chemistry,

293
00:18:31.261 --> 00:18:31.890
and geography.

294
00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:36.180
Whereas I'm doing English and history and classical civilization scrap that.

295
00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:39.930
What people do is they try to make the story better by showing more

296
00:18:39.931 --> 00:18:40.711
similarities.

297
00:18:40.711 --> 00:18:45.060
So you're saying that somebody could imagine who doctored the story,

298
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.750
by the way, I don't want to spoil anything and this is a trivial comment,

299
00:18:48.751 --> 00:18:52.470
but I believe that one of the girls was actually nine and the other one was 10.

300
00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:00.160
Oh, well that's the story through it. Never mind.

301
00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.210
I'm sorry to be your most depressing guess. Nonetheless,

302
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:08.030
I will continue to tell the larger story every chance I get on the air at

303
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.930
parties, wherever, because you know,

304
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.950
damn the statistics just makes me feel good. I think Jay would agree with you.

305
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:18.690
Well, it first of all, we love stories that connects us. It makes,

306
00:19:18.691 --> 00:19:21.010
it gives us insight into our own lives. Um,

307
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.270
and I think it also gives us a feeling that life is magical

308
00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:30.310
<v 2>and maybe we don't have to call it magic to enjoy the experience. In fact,</v>

309
00:19:30.311 --> 00:19:31.750
I was talking to the Laura's and I asked them,

310
00:19:31.751 --> 00:19:35.110
what if a statistician would walk in the room right now and say to you,

311
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.450
this was bound to happen? Statistically,

312
00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:42.610
this was going to happen sometime to someone. Fair enough. Really,

313
00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.300
because it just happens to be us in those statistics though. I mean,

314
00:19:46.301 --> 00:19:50.530
if that's what the statistician thinks, I mean, yeah, I game to him.

315
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:53.890
They don't really care where they see it. Whatever was in that wind,

316
00:19:53.891 --> 00:19:57.100
whether it was fate or just wind, doesn't matter.

317
00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.680
We brought them together and now.
