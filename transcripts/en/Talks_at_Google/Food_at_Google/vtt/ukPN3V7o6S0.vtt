FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi, everybody.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.080
So thank you so
much for being here.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.710
Today we are absolutely
delighted to welcome Chef Alain

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.380
Ducasse, one of the
most renowned chefs

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.920
of his generation.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.480
And he's here to talk to us
about his book "J'aime London,"

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.670
which he's recently launched.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.180
Chef Ducasse is a
restaurant creator,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.130
a contemporary innkeeper, an
educator, and a publisher.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.470
And over the past
30 years, he has

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.510
developed a unique
savoir-faire which

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.230
has helped to shape the
contemporary art of living

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.610
and eating.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.590
And he is joined by his
old friend and fellow

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.880
chef, Michel Roux
Jr, who has kindly

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.070
written the forward to
the book "J'aime London."

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.440
And he will be conducting
the conversation.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.170
And he's also almost fresh from
the London Marathon on Sunday.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.550
So if he hobbles onto the stage,
then you'll know why that is.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.856
So welcome to Chef
Ducasse and Chef Roux.

00:01:12.856 --> 00:01:16.328

ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:01:29.446 --> 00:01:30.820
MICHEL ROUX JR:
Hello, everybody.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.590
Thankfully there were
no steps to climb up.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.930
A nice easy, easy up
onto the stage here,

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.470
and a nice, comfy chair.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.360
Good.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.870
Thank you.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.050
Thank you for coming here today.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.970
Thank you for having us.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.140
My friend Alain and fellow chef,
god to a lot of young chefs,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.810
and someone that is
highly, highly respected.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.830
An all time great.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.080
An all time great.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.670
So we're going to get to know
a little bit more about Alain--

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.220
about his philosophy.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.861
And although he
understands English,

00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:12.360
he says his English
isn't that good.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.445
But he can say a
few words, so we're

00:02:14.445 --> 00:02:16.820
going to try and coax a little
bit of English out of him.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.210
But I'm here to translate and
to ask him a few questions.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.462
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:02:24.462 --> 00:02:25.420
MICHEL ROUX JR: I will.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.020
I will do my best.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.353
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:02:27.353 --> 00:02:28.850
MICHEL ROUX JR: I
will do my best.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.500
So Alain, first of all,
I want to find out--

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.560
or we would like to
find out-- a little bit

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.380
about you, how you started.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.800
It's well documented about me.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.367
I was nearly born in a kitchen.

00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:43.200
But I would like to
know, and everybody here

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.380
would like to know,
how you started.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.430
How Alain Ducasse, a little
boy, got into cooking.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.820
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:02:51.820 --> 00:03:04.000
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.150
MICHEL ROUX JR: So Alain said,
like a lot of French kids,

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.480
their grandmother
was cooking at home.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.307
Grandma's cooking.

00:03:11.307 --> 00:03:12.640
I remember my grandma's cooking.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.010
It was beautiful.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.000
Beautiful.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.510
And that is what inspired him.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.580
He was born on a farm in
the southwest of France.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.330
He has the accent.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.414
I don't know if you clocked
that one, the accent

00:03:22.414 --> 00:03:24.080
of the southwest of
France, probably one

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.060
of the most beautiful
regions in France.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.880
Very rich.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.350
[FRENCH]

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:48.210
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:53.920
MICHEL ROUX JR: A real idyllic
childhood in a village.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:01.120
Being able to go to your local
farm or shop to buy the goods.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.940
[FRENCH] as we call it
in France-- real land.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.800
And the beauty of
that part of France

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.250
is that it has great
sunshine, but it also

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.560
has the sea air, as well.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.339
So it has proper seasons
and it's very rich and lush.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:21.410
And the ingredients that
come there are beautiful.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:56.930
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.620
MICHEL ROUX JR: I
think that's where

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.840
his inspiration comes from.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.790
And it is from
those early years,

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.940
and being able to pick
up wonderful ingredients,

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.070
and then being inspired by them
to create beautiful dishes.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.330
But dishes that have a
meaning, that have an origin.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.027
[FRENCH]

00:05:14.027 --> 00:05:15.360

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.735

ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.630
MICHEL ROUX JR: So he's keen.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.230
He said he wasn't
learning enough so

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.730
he escaped the village
and went to a hotel

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.855
catering school, of which
there are many in France.

00:05:31.855 --> 00:05:32.550
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.716
MICHEL ROUX JR: In Bordeaux.

00:05:33.716 --> 00:05:35.110

ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:05:43.292 --> 00:05:44.750
MICHEL ROUX JR:
He's just mentioned

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.709
some of the greats of France
in passing, in passing.

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:51.250
Michel Guerard in
the southwest-- one

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.950
of the most beautiful places.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.260
If you haven't been to
Michel Guerard before,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.810
go and spend a week there.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.570
Eugenie-les-Bains--
it is outstanding.

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.830
I remember my best
ever dessert-- sorry,

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.980
but I'm going-- my
best ever dessert,

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.820
and it has yet to be
topped, was quite simply

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.120
a wild strawberry tart.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.400
That sounds just
banal, doesn't it?

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.510
[FRENCH]

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.957
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:06:19.957 --> 00:06:22.620
MICHEL ROUX JR: It
was extraordinary.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.570
So sorry.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.370
Eugenie-les-Bains--
worked there.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.420
And then you worked
for Alain Chapel.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.410
I just missed Alain.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.340
I think Alain finished in
August and I started work

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.050
in September.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.680
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.950
MICHEL ROUX JR: He's a
year or two older than me.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.730
We worked in the
same place for Alain

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.972
Chapel-- an extraordinary chef.

00:06:44.972 --> 00:06:45.930
What did Alain Chapel--

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.535
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]
was a perfect experience.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:07:08.500
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.030
MICHEL ROUX JR: The
experience at Alain Chapel

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.520
taught him rigor.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.500
But also the fact that
Alain Chapel was way ahead

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:21.490
of his years, and he was a
modern chef of that era-- quite

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:22.320
extraordinary.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.350
I learned well, I always
go back to Alain Chapel.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.005
For me he was my
strongest influence.

00:07:27.005 --> 00:07:27.390
ALAIN DUCASSE:
Yeah, for me, too.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.710
MICHEL ROUX JR: And I
think Alain, as well.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:30.260
A great man.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:53.690
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.690
MICHEL ROUX JR: Alain
Chapel was haute cuisine--

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.520
the true meaning of it-- in
the same way as haute couture

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.710
is now, and will always exist,
and should always exist.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:08.630
So he really was the
benchmark, Alain Chapel.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:12.300
Sadly no longer open, and
sadly no longer with us.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.130
[FRENCH] Monaco?

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:55.209
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:08:55.209 --> 00:08:56.750
MICHEL ROUX JR: It
was a huge gamble.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.830
The Prince Rainier, in Monaco,
got Alain as a young chef

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.090
and said, look,
this is what I want.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:07.280
I want three Michelin Stars and
you've got four years to do it,

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.980
and threw down the gauntlet.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.420
And Alain achieved the
three stars in 33 months.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.570
So he certainly
did achieve that.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:17.980
And it's still going strong.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.060
I was very fortunate
and honored to be there

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:26.060
for the birthday celebrations
two years ago, now, wasn't it?

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.750
It goes so quickly.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:29.800
Truly extraordinary.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.326
And it is, again, I
urge you-- this is

00:09:33.326 --> 00:09:34.700
one place where
you've got to go.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.730
It's got to be on
your bucket list.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:40.380
Go to Monaco, and go to Alain's
restaurant there, Le Louis XV.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.890
It is extraordinary,
extraordinary.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:47.800
And [INAUDIBLE] its
longevity, its consistency--

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.500
that is the hallmark
of a great man

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.620
and the hallmark of
a great restaurant,

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.640
is that it is consistent--
consistently good,

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.482
delivering the goods
time and time again.

00:09:59.482 --> 00:10:00.190
Monaco, [FRENCH].

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:53.006
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:10:53.006 --> 00:10:54.420
MICHEL ROUX JR:
So his philosophy

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.320
behind that cuisine--
Riviera Cuisine-- was

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:04.870
to take humble goods and very
classic, instantly recognizable

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:08.590
dishes-- such as bouillabaisse,
an aioli, or the dishes

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:12.230
that you would recognize on a
menu in the south of France,

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:16.680
in that area-- and to make
that into haute gastronomy--

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.580
something that is worthy
of three Michelin Stars.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.810
So using the great produce--
of which there are so many,

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.620
but you have to find
them-- and making them

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.400
into exquisite food,
exquisite dishes,

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.730
but still with that
philosophy of Riviera Cuisine.

MICHEL ROUX JR: The politics
of the Michelin guide--

I don't think we're
going to go into that.

00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:26.480
But Alain was explaining
that he got a phone call

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.517
from Joel Robuchon,
another amazing chef,

00:12:31.517 --> 00:12:33.850
to announce that he was
retiring and that if Alain would

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:36.320
be interested in taking his
place in a restaurant in Paris.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.360
And then he said, well,
just over the phone,

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.870
he couldn't believe that
Robuchon was phoning.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.078
He said, well, yeah, why not.

00:12:41.078 --> 00:12:42.530
So off he went to Paris.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.660
And the Michelin
Guide removed one star

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:49.170
from one of his
restaurants just because he

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.331
was moving as a chef.

00:12:51.331 --> 00:12:53.080
That's the politics
of the Michelin Guide,

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.310
and they do work
in mysterious ways.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:59.600
He got it back instantly,
which he deserved.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.870
And that was the beginning of
the Alain Ducasse adventure

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.890
and venturing out worldwide.

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:08.040
So many restaurants
in Paris, Monaco,

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.000
and all over the
world, including

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.710
London, of course, as well.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:17.720
A little bit about
Alain and going global--

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.870
or as you call it, glocal--

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:52.050
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.630
MICHEL ROUX JR: I think
this is fantastic.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:55.620
I love this.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.960
Glocal.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.880
It really does-- it's perfect.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:04.180
And I don't think it's
just for us in cooking.

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.330
I think it's in any business.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:12.290
Wherever you go, you may be a
global brand-- in his instance,

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:15.130
he is a global brand
in his own right--

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:21.670
but he will use local produce,
local workforce where possible,

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:30.110
and not forgetting he is
cooking for a local customer.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.640
So in America, he will
be cooking for Americans.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.610
In London, he's
cooking for Londoners,

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:35.650
or for British people.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.310
In Paris, for Parisians.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:39.740
And that is very important.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:43.000
And it's the key to
success in most businesses.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.130
If he were to force or ram
down the throat-- in New York,

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:49.864
for example-- typically French,
and have it all imported

00:14:49.864 --> 00:14:51.530
and all that, it
probably wouldn't work.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:53.670
Or it wouldn't be
as well-respected.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:58.010
And I think that is really the
key to the Alain Ducasse brand

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:02.350
and the strength--
his glocal vision.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:06.200
And I think he should be really
highly commended for that.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:30.259
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:15:30.259 --> 00:15:32.050
MICHEL ROUX JR: I think
what Alain has just

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:33.633
said there is very
important, as well.

00:15:33.633 --> 00:15:38.120
I think all great chefs are
teachers-- natural teachers--

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.030
and want to pass
on their knowledge.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:44.410
Alain has written many,
many books-- great books.

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:46.320
And it's all part of his psyche.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.610
It's part of him being
a very generous chef.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:52.530
He has cooking schools, as well.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:54.700
It's all part of his philosophy.

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.800
And my father and uncle-- the
Roux Scholarship, for example--

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.070
that's been going on for 31
years helping British chefs

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:02.370
to achieve their goals.

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:09.570
We all too often see young
chefs who are in the limelight

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:13.110
and trying to get the glory,
but don't think of the future.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:15.470
And the future is
passing on your knowledge

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:18.360
and being generous
with your time.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.220
And I think that
is something which

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.070
Alain is very generous with
his time, and very generous

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.970
with his staff, as well.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:47.797
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:16:47.797 --> 00:16:49.130
MICHEL ROUX JR: Yes, absolutely.

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:52.410
Cooking is happening
all over the world.

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:56.160
It doesn't matter where you're
from-- on what continent, what

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.110
the color of your skin
is-- everybody cooks,

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:00.850
and everybody has a heritage.

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:03.060
And that's certainly
very important.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.260
And it's so beautiful.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:11.430
But cooking evolves and
moves-- moves at a steady pace,

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.500
and moves with us.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:17.640
And it's up to us, as chefs,
to express that, as well.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.270
[FRENCH]

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.270
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:36.800
MICHEL ROUX JR: (LAUGHING)
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.930
When I was an apprentice
in Paris at the age of 16,

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:40.710
my French was absolutely pants.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:41.880
It was crap.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.150
And my boss there,
in Paris, used

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.190
to call me "le roast beef."

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.690
Roast beef.

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:53.120
So we've touched upon
your global vision.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.760
We've touched a little
bit upon your origins

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.172
and what makes Alain Ducasse
the great chef he is.

00:17:59.172 --> 00:18:03.470
But what about your new
and latest creation here?

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.400
"J'aime London."
"I Love London."

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:34.240
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.707
MICHEL ROUX JR: It was-- he's
done Paris, Monaco, New York--

00:18:37.707 --> 00:18:39.040
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.831
MICHEL ROUX JR: [FRENCH]
London, of course.

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:46.690
What Alain sees in London is
a great, vibrant city-- a city

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:50.790
that now has embraced food,
wine, and all the finer

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:54.560
things of life that we love.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.690
And he's excited, genuinely
excited, about London.

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:57.356
He loves London.

00:18:57.356 --> 00:19:01.420
And he knows London-- maybe not
as well as I do, but almost.

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.400
He spends quite a bit
of time in London.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.010
So this book is about that.

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:09.300
And it's about expressing the
vibrancy of this great city.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.500
It's not just restaurants.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.330
There are--

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:31.980
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:36.910
MICHEL ROUX JR: So every
place listed in the book

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:40.272
is usually led by a
personality, by somebody

00:19:40.272 --> 00:19:41.730
who has got character,
and somebody

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:44.370
who believes in what he does.

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:47.910
And that's very much
the strength of the-- it

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:48.830
might be just a cafe.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:49.890
It might be just a bar.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:51.350
It might be just a wine shop.

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:52.410
It could be a restaurant.

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:52.970
I'm in there.

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:54.530
It could be a high
end restaurant,

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:58.170
or it could be just a very, very
straightforward little Italian

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:00.510
shop that serves
the best espresso.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.590
But it's with love,
and it's good,

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:04.140
and it's got something there.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:05.500
It's got a heritage.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.010
So that is what the
book is all about.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:09.530
"I Love London."

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:11.160
I genuinely do love London.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.510
It's a great, great book.

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:14.010
And it's fun.

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.370
And I think what's great
about the book is that you've

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:20.430
captured, in the
photography, the real feel.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:26.880
It's not a staid cookbook
that you see dishes close up

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.530
and you think, oh
wow, and recipes.

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:30.150
No.

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:31.930
It tells a story.

ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:04.050
MICHEL ROUX JR:
It's exactly that.

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:06.320
London is a melting
pot, as we all know.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.950
And the question
I get often asked

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:14.300
is, what is the
greatest city to eat in?

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:15.110
Is it Paris?

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.860
Is it London?

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:16.646
Is it New York?

00:21:16.646 --> 00:21:17.520
ALAIN DUCASSE: Tokyo.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.436
MICHEL ROUX JR: Tokyo.

00:21:18.436 --> 00:21:20.050
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:23.880
MICHEL ROUX JR: To be honest,
I think every city is up there.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.950
Every city is different.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:28.980
I'm a little bit biased because
I consider myself a Londoner.

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:30.360
But I love going to Paris.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.570
I love going to New York.

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:33.770
And they have
individualities, and that's

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:35.290
what's so beautiful about it.

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.550
They are so different.

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:40.260
And you are here
because you're foodies,

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.801
because you love food and wine.

00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:44.550
And you all know what
we're talking about.

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:46.900
When you go to New York,
the first thing you look up

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.280
is, where am I going to
go to dinner tonight.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.060
And Paris, as well.

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:54.105
That's what's so exciting
about these great cities.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.620
Question time, maybe?

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:00.400
A few questions?

In the Bulgari

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.360

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.642
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
here in Google.

00:24:28.642 --> 00:24:30.350
And we're a wonderful
technology company.

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:32.760
I'm interested to know if
when you go to a new city,

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.125
what technology do you use
to find new restaurants?

00:24:38.037 --> 00:24:39.370
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:42.893
MICHEL ROUX JR:
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:24:42.893 --> 00:24:44.226
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:24:44.226 --> 00:24:44.710
MICHEL ROUX JR:
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:46.043
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:24:46.043 --> 00:24:47.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:53.725
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:24:53.725 --> 00:24:55.100
MICHEL ROUX JR:
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:24:55.100 --> 00:25:07.999
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:25:07.999 --> 00:25:10.040
MICHEL ROUX JR: I don't
know if you got all that,

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.080
but he's got offices
all over the world.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.660
And the people that
work for him seriously

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.880
like to eat and drink out, so--

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:31.157
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:25:31.157 --> 00:25:33.240
MICHEL ROUX JR: I think
that's the best, isn't it?

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:33.781
It really is.

00:25:33.781 --> 00:25:35.950
It's personal
recommendation, basically.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:37.937
And so the buzz, the
buzz of the atmosphere.

00:25:37.937 --> 00:25:39.270
This is the place to go and eat.

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:44.380
This is-- and Alain is
very much like all of us.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.650
We all do the same.

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:48.550
Yes, we may go on to various
websites, or whatever,

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:51.300
but personal recommendation
is always the best.

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.610
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:55.770
MICHEL ROUX JR:
Otherwise, Google.

00:25:55.770 --> 00:27:10.931
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:27:10.931 --> 00:27:12.930
MICHEL ROUX JR: It's very
true, what Alain says.

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:18.140
He says that in our industry,
we are very close-- very close

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.360
together.

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:22.985
And he trusts his
fellow chefs to give him

00:27:22.985 --> 00:27:28.480
the right information to go and
eat in such and such a place.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.870
Other than all the buzz
created by the media,

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:39.640
and by newspapers, and such
like about the industry--

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.100
about inter-fighting
or whatever,

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:45.660
or being the best restaurant,
this, and various lists

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:49.120
of top restaurant in the
world, or this restaurant--

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:52.500
above that, between
us we communicate.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:53.660
And it's very, very close.

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:57.980
He thinks that it's probably
one of the few crafts,

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:01.830
or industries, where
we are so close,

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:05.830
and communicate so closely,
and respect each other.

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:08.870
Maybe in medicine, he said,
there is such a feeling.

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:13.030
Another question?

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:14.090
Someone got another?

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:15.560
Yes, young lady over there.

00:28:20.015 --> 00:28:21.640
AUDIENCE: I was just
wondering how long

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:24.710
it took to find all the
places and restaurants,

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:26.560
and was there a
team working on it?

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:36.260
MICHEL ROUX JR:
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:28:36.260 --> 00:29:02.557
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:29:02.557 --> 00:29:03.890
MICHEL ROUX JR: About two years.

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:08.030
And I think that's an average
for books, about two years.

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:10.200
Two years from conception,
and then a year

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.910
to actually bring
it all together.

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:14.170
And like he said, it's
not easy because chefs

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.860
have got pretty unusual diaries.

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:20.200
And some chefs are
more or less organized.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.340
And so it's not always
easy, not always easy.

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.140
But about two years.

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:54.860
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.360
MICHEL ROUX JR:
Alain's very humble.

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:57.984
He said he didn't do
it all by himself.

00:29:57.984 --> 00:30:01.744
He's got a team there behind
him that obviously put forward

00:30:01.744 --> 00:30:02.910
lots of different addresses.

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:05.810
But he says, there could
be 100 more addresses

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:07.830
in this particular book.

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:12.350
But it's just to show the
diversity and the greatness

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:16.410
of London-- showing off what
London has got best to offer.

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:18.050
But it could be even
bigger, he says.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:22.080
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.070
You talked a little bit
about the personalities

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:26.620
and the venues you visited.

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.190
I'm really conscious we're
all in food together.

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:33.160
And there's the food, the
service, and the experience.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.650
And I'm really interested
in your thoughts on food

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:37.990
experience and how
that's changing

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:39.240
as you go around these venues.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.180
And how, in my
opinion, the experience

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:45.142
is becoming a lot more
important than it used to be.

00:30:45.142 --> 00:30:46.850
MICHEL ROUX JR: So
experience as a whole?

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:48.490
AUDIENCE: Well, yeah
the environment,

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:51.500
the service, as
well as the food.

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:58.410
MICHEL ROUX JR:
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:25.590
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:28.890
MICHEL ROUX JR:
[FRENCH] Alain thinks

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:35.200
that it should be majority
percentage of satisfaction

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:35.720
of the food.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:42.100
So the food, or whatever you're
eating, has to be memorable.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.920
And then the rest,
obviously, is the package,

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:50.540
is the environment-- so
the decor, the staff--

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:54.760
to make up that whole package
and that whole experience.

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.130
And it doesn't matter if
it's Michelin Starred--

00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:03.120
the high end-- or even
a little bar or a cafe.

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:08.220
It has to be that kind of mix,
and agreed that is a package.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.302
It's not just food led.

00:32:14.922 --> 00:32:17.820
AUDIENCE: You can't turn
the television on these days

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:21.530
without falling over, yes,
another cookery program.

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:23.120
Some of which are
better than others.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.240
MICHEL ROUX JR:
Where is this going?

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.680
AUDIENCE: But my
question is, is that

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.250
having an impact on
the quality of people

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:33.090
coming into the trade?

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:35.160
And a second,
supplementary question

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.450
is, do you think that's
changing the way-- particularly

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:40.620
in the UK-- British
consumers are

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.870
approaching going
to restaurants?

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:47.190
Are our expectations rising?

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:57.190
MICHEL ROUX JR:
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:58.890
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:02.590
MICHEL ROUX JR:
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:20.970
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:22.980
MICHEL ROUX JR:
[FRENCH] Alain says yes

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:26.840
because it creates
a buzz, creates

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.712
a certain want
from the people who

00:33:29.712 --> 00:33:31.880
are watching their television
to go to this place

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:35.640
or to be interested
more in food.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:38.897
The second part of your
question was, is it--

00:33:38.897 --> 00:33:39.730
AUDIENCE: Two parts.

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:41.370
One was, are you
seeing better quality

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:43.060
people coming into the industry.

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:45.300
And then the other one is
the customer expectation.

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:51.770
MICHEL ROUX JR:
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:55.560
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:58.080
MICHEL ROUX JR: I mean it does.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:01.550
The way I see it, it certainly
does bring in some youngsters

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:03.970
into our industry, which
can only be a good thing.

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:05.860
However, some of them
come into our industry

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:07.030
for the wrong reasons.

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:10.030
They think that they can
be the next Jamie Oliver,

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:12.179
Gordon Ramsay, me.

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:12.979
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:12.979 --> 00:34:14.270
MICHEL ROUX JR: Be the next me.

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:22.380
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.500
MICHEL ROUX JR: But
the problem with that

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:28.100
is, they don't realize
that Jamie Oliver, Gordon

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:31.760
Ramsay, Michel Roux
worked their ass off--

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:35.570
worked damn hard to
get to where we are.

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:37.580
Television came later.

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:40.739
So those youngsters that
come into the industry

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:42.870
on the false pretense--
on the pretense of being

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:45.469
the next television chef--
they normally get it wrong,

00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:47.699
and they go away
very, very, very soon.

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:51.790
Personally, I do think
that it's a good thing.

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:54.639
But not all programs.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:57.530
I don't know if you guys know
about my spat-- recent spat--

00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:58.210
with the BBC.

00:34:58.210 --> 00:34:59.210
I walked away from them.

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:00.470
But that's another story.

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:04.660
That's just editorial policy and
the BBC being very pig-headed.

00:35:07.285 --> 00:35:10.430
Just needed to get it
off my chest, sorry.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:11.700
But I will do something.

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.560
I will do something
else, maybe with Google.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.120
Who knows?

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:19.270
You do TV, or that
kind of stuff.

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:22.050
It's interesting.

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:25.180
But I do believe,
like Alain, that media

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:29.000
plays a very strong
part in our industry

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.630
for the stuff
coming in, but also

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:38.260
for the public because
there is an interest.

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:39.610
They see the food.

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:42.040
And I see this in
England, especially,

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.120
where if I take an example
of snails-- 20 years ago,

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.030
you put snails on
the menu in England,

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:48.660
and we just wouldn't sell it.

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:49.720
It wouldn't go.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.260
Or you would occasionally
get people who would buy it,

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.390
but it-- no.

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:56.650
And if you asked the
customer, why would

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:58.020
you not want to eat snails?

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:00.520
The answer was, I
don't like them.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.180
Have you tried them, sir?

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:04.740
No, I just don't like them.

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.470
Now it's totally different.

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:09.840
The British public
want to try them.

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.010
They are curious.

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:14.100
And that curiosity
has come through media

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:18.070
and through wanting to
learn and wanting to taste.

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:20.393
And that's been television
led and media led.

00:36:20.393 --> 00:36:21.726
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:36:21.726 --> 00:36:24.106
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:24.106 --> 00:36:26.486
FEMALE SPEAKER: One more
question. [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:26.486 --> 00:36:28.150
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks
for joining us.

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:30.470
Can you tell us about
a restaurant experience

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:32.650
that you've had recently
that you really enjoyed,

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:35.920
and what it was that
made it for you?

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:51.250
MICHEL ROUX JR:
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:53.867
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:36:53.867 --> 00:36:59.230
MICHEL ROUX JR:
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:21.900
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:25.000
MICHEL ROUX JR: It's a
slightly off the beat answer,

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.450
but Cecile-- Alain's
assistant-- said to him one day,

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:32.850
look, I've got this new
address, this new place,

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:35.030
that you've got to try
when you're in Kyoto.

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:39.600
And as it happened, two weeks
later, he was going to Kyoto.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:58.850
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:01.230
MICHEL ROUX JR: So he takes
the address on the card,

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:03.640
and comes by taxi,
and it just looks

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:04.800
like there's nothing there.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:29.060
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.465
MICHEL ROUX JR: So only when
he had pulled this door open

00:38:31.465 --> 00:38:32.910
that he saw a
table that was laid

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.410
and one chef standing to
attention that he realized

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:37.300
that actually, we were
in the right place.

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.310
This was the right address.

00:38:39.310 --> 00:39:18.870
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:20.370
MICHEL ROUX JR:
That's unbelievable.

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:23.960
It was a vegan restaurant
so absolutely no animal

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.910
protein whatsoever.

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:30.180
And this chef had studied
in this particular style

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:32.610
of Japanese food for 20 years.

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:36.360
And he said it was a
mind-blowing experience.

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:37.250
So there you have it.

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:38.832
Alain Ducasse eating vegan food.

00:39:38.832 --> 00:39:41.180
That's shock horror.

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:45.800
But I must say I had a similar
experience just outside Tokyo,

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.300
as well.

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:53.170
And it was in an old
Buddhist community.

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:56.190
And it was a vegetarian
tasting menu.

00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:57.870
And it was extraordinary.

00:39:57.870 --> 00:40:01.430
So this is probably one
step further, vegan.

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:03.990
But it goes to prove
that you don't actually

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:06.610
need to eat animal
protein every day.

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:09.480
We were talking about this
just before we came in here.

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:11.470
And this is another
passion of Alain's, and it

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:18.192
is the future-- what
the future holds

00:40:18.192 --> 00:40:20.150
not just for our industry,
but as a population,

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:23.000
a global population--
the fact that we really

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.680
should be looking at
what we're eating very,

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:28.850
very closely because we are
going to run out of food.

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:31.340
And the need to eat
animal protein--

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:34.130
do we really need to eat
chicken every day of the week?

00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:35.700
And no, we don't.

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.970
Let's eat chicken once a week.

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:41.770
But let's make it a
really good chicken.

00:40:41.770 --> 00:41:05.550
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:06.970
MICHEL ROUX JR: Wow.

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:09.720
So Alain, ever the
businessman, was intrigued.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.790
Because how can you run
a business like this?

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:13.730
How can you run a
successful restaurant?

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:17.580
And he asked the owner and
said, well, how do you survive?

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:19.360
How do you keep
this place going?

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:22.090
And he said, well, tonight
is my very last night.

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:24.160
Once you're finished,
I close the door.

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.730
Finished.

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:28.920
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:35.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.510
MICHEL ROUX JR: Isn't
that a lovely story?

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:38.750
That's a lovely story.

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:42.250
So for those of you who
didn't quite get it,

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:46.780
the chef closed the door
and to go full circle,

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:49.940
he will be working for Alain
Ducasse as from next week.

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:51.885
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:41:51.885 --> 00:41:53.567
MICHEL ROUX JR: He's
starting on Friday

00:41:53.567 --> 00:41:54.650
working for Alain Ducasse.

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:56.900
And I'm sure he will
be a huge success.

00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:23.124
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:42:23.124 --> 00:42:24.040
MICHEL ROUX JR: It is.

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.820
And that's just it.

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:27.820
This wouldn't have been
capable of-- we wouldn't

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:30.080
have been able to do
this 20 years ago.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.240
But now, how the
world has changed,

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:35.330
and how Japan has changed
very much, as well.

00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:38.070
They are no longer insular,
they have opened up to this.

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:45.880
And so now we can cross over--
France, England, and Japan,

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:49.980
and all these wonderful melting
pots-- and share our knowledge,

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:51.740
and share our cuisine together.

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:54.630
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:57.970
MICHEL ROUX JR:
Artisinal Google, yes.

00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:01.330
FEMALE SPEAKER: We're just going
to take one final question.

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:05.230
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm interested in
Alain's vision for the future,

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:06.370
actually.

00:43:06.370 --> 00:43:08.600
So what food will we
be eating and talking

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:10.627
about in five or 10 years time?

00:43:10.627 --> 00:43:11.960
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.560
MICHEL ROUX JR:
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:35.660
ALAIN DUCASSE: [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:37.410
MICHEL ROUX JR: It's
very, very important,

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:39.720
and I touched on it earlier.

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:45.320
Alain thinks that us, as
chefs, have a responsibility,

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:48.000
as well to get this
message across--

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.690
that we cannot carry
on eating as we do now.

00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:56.020
So we must cut back
on animal protein,

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:59.120
less salt, sugar,
fat, et cetera.

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.330
Because the world
will run out of food.

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:03.600
It's quite simple.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:05.310
So we have to re-educate.

00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:09.030
We have to re-educate everyone,
and to be less wasteful,

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:10.480
and to eat well.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.110
Because there is
famine about now,

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:14.360
but there could be a lot more.

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.670
Does that answer your--

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:20.394
AUDIENCE: Yes, thanks.

00:44:20.394 --> 00:44:21.810
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Thank you so much.

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:23.143
It was really, really wonderful.

00:44:23.143 --> 00:44:24.700
We have an expression
here in Google,

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:27.900
which is the Google 10 Pounds,
which is the weight that you

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:29.800
gain when you come to work here.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:46.650
[FRENCH] I think I gained
a few pounds just listening

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:49.000
to the chefs talk here.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.624
And so we'd like to
say, really, thank you.

00:44:51.624 --> 00:44:53.040
It was wonderful
to listen to you.

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:55.110
Thank you for coming to
spend the time with us.

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:57.857
Chef Ducasse is going to be
signing his book outside.

00:44:57.857 --> 00:44:59.440
So for those of you
who have bought it

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.330
or would like to
buy it, he's going

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:03.550
to spend a little bit of
time signing some books.

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:06.810
And also, we're just going
to finish with a video

00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:09.870
that Chef Ducasse would like
to share with you on chocolate

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:10.822
manufacturers.

00:45:10.822 --> 00:45:11.530
So cue the video.

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:13.050
And thank you so much.

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:17.026
