00:00:00.722 --> 00:00:02.180
Let's say I have
some object that's

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.050
traveling in a circular
path just like this.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.490
And what I've drawn here
is its velocity vector

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.140
at different points
along that path.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.080
And so this right over
here is going to be v1,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.320
velocity vector 1.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.960
This is going to be
velocity vector 2.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.410
And this right over here is
going to be velocity vector 3.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.610
And what we're going to
assume, in this video,

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.555
is that the magnitude of these
velocity vectors is constant.

00:00:28.555 --> 00:00:31.180
Or another way to think about it
is that the speed is constant.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.676
So I'll just say lowercase
v without the arrow on top--

00:00:34.676 --> 00:00:37.050
so this is going to be a scalar
quantity-- I'll call this

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.970
the speed.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.630
Or you could call this the
magnitude of these vectors.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.280
And this is going
to be constant.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.340
So this is going to be equal
to the magnitude of vector

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.580
1, which is equal to the
magnitude of vector 2.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.470
The direction is
clearly changing,

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.400
but the magnitude is going
to be the same, which

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.980
is equal to the
magnitude of vector 3.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.880
And we're going to assume
that it's traveling in a path,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.527
in a circle with radius r.

00:01:02.527 --> 00:01:04.110
And what I'm going
to do is, I'm going

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.960
to draw a position
vector at each point.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.280
So let's call r1-- actually I'll
just do it in pink-- let's call

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.790
r1 that right over there.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.430
That's position vector r1.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.010
That is position vector r2.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.830
So the position is
clearly changing.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.280
That's position vector r2.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.250
And that is position vector r3.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.220
But the magnitude of
our position vectors

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.876
are clearly the same.

00:01:32.876 --> 00:01:35.000
And I'm going to call the
magnitude of our position

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.592
vectors r.

00:01:35.592 --> 00:01:37.300
And that's just the
radius of the circle.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.350
It's this distance
right over here.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.500
So r is equal to
the magnitude of r1,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.000
which is equal to the
magnitude of r2, which

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.849
is equal to the magnitude of r3.

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:50.390
Now what I want to
do, in this video,

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.300
is prove to you visually,
that given this radius

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.720
and given this speed,
that the magnitude

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.270
of the centripetal
acceleration-- and I'll

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.860
just write that as a sub c,
I don't have an arrow on top,

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.600
so this is a scalar quantity.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.130
So the magnitude of the
centripetal acceleration

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.680
is going to be equal
to our speed squared,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.930
our constant speed
squared, divided

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.740
by the radius of the circle.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.870
I want you to feel good
that this is indeed

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.910
the case by the
end of this video.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.220
And to understand
that, what I want to do

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.240
is I want to re-plot
these velocity

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.870
vectors on another
circle and just

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.000
think about how the vectors
themselves are changing.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.780
So let's copy and paste this.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.000
So let me copy and paste v1.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.270
So copy and paste.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.210
So that is v-- actually I
want to do it from the center

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.910
--so that is v1.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.500
Then let me do the
same thing for v2.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.410
So let me copy and paste it.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.450
That is v2.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.460
And then let me
do it also for v3.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.300
I'll just get the vector part;
I don't have to get the label.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.120
So copy and paste it.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.460
And that right over
there is vector v3.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.670
And let me clean
this up a little bit.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.955
So that's clearly v2.

00:03:14.955 --> 00:03:16.580
I don't think we have
to label anymore.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.950
We know that v2 is in orange.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.150
And what is the
radius of this circle

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.450
going to be right over here?

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.880
Well, the radius
of this circle is

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.799
going to be the magnitude
of the velocity vectors.

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.840
And we already know the
magnitude of the velocity

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.350
vectors is this quantity
v, this scalar quantity.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.180
So the radius of this circle is
v. The radius of this circle,

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.470
we already know, is equal to r.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.480
And just as the
velocity vector is

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.250
what's giving us the
change in position

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.102
over time, the change in
position vector over time,

00:03:52.102 --> 00:03:53.810
what's the vector
that's going to give us

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.080
the change in our
velocity vector over time?

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.500
Well, that's going to be
our acceleration vectors.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.400
So you will have
some acceleration.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.880
We'll call this a1.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.750
We'll call this a2.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.550
And I'll call this a3.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.050
And I want to make
sure that you get

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.960
the analogy that's
going on here.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.450
As we go around in this
circle, the position

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.740
vectors first they point out
to the left, then the upper,

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.925
kind of in a maybe
11 o'clock position,

00:04:23.925 --> 00:04:27.380
or I guess the top left,
and then to the top.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.760
So it's pointing in these
different directions

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.280
like a hand in a clock.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.200
And what's moving it
along there is the change

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.170
in position vector
over time, which

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.030
are these velocity vectors.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.810
Over here, the velocity
vectors are moving around

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.960
like the hands of a clock.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.650
And what is doing
the moving around

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.260
are these acceleration vectors.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.340
And over here, the
velocity vectors

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.220
are tangential to the
path, which is a circle.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.070
They're perpendicular
to a radius.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.160
And you learned
that in geometry--

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.380
that a line that is
tangent to a circle

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.140
is perpendicular to a radius.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.007
And it's also going to be the
same thing right over here.

00:05:08.007 --> 00:05:09.590
And just going back
to what we learned

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.048
when we learned
about the intuition

00:05:11.048 --> 00:05:14.200
of centripetal acceleration, if
you look at a1 right over here,

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.520
and you translate this vector,
it'll be going just like that.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.240
It is going towards the center.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.910
a2, once again, is going
towards the center.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.920
a3, once again, if
you translate that,

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.060
that is going
towards the center.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.840
So all of these are actually
center-seeking vectors.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.630
And you see that
right over here.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.230
These are actually centripetal
acceleration vectors

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.160
right over here.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.279
Here we're talking about
just the magnitude of it.

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:40.070
And we're going to
assume that all of these

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.470
have the same magnitude.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.690
So we're going to
assume that they all

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.120
have a magnitude of
what we'll call a sub c.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.220
So that's the magnitude.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.700
And it's equal to
the magnitude of a1.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.600
That vector, it's equal
to the magnitude of a2.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.770
And it's equal to
the magnitude of a3.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.790
Now what I want to think
about is how long is it

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.670
going to take for
this thing to get

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.410
from this point on the circle
to that point on that circle

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.780
right over there?

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.640
So the way to think about it
is, what's the length of the arc

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.860
that it traveled?

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.790
The length of this arc that
it traveled right over there.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.750
That's 1/4 around the circle.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.670
It's going to be 1/4
of the circumference.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.420
The circumference is 2 pi r.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.060
It Is going to be 1/4 of that.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.376
So that is the
length of the arc.

00:06:30.376 --> 00:06:32.250
And then how long will
it take it to go that?

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.300
Well, you would
divide the length

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.500
of your path divided by the
actual speed, the actual thing

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.700
that's nudging it
along that path.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.090
So you want to divide that by
the magnitude of your velocity,

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:45.770
or your speed.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.770
This is the magnitude of
velocity, not velocity.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.220
This is not a vector right
over here, this is a scalar.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:55.280
So this is going to be the
time to travel along that path.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.867
Now the time to
travel along this path

00:06:56.867 --> 00:06:58.700
is going to be the exact
same amount of time

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.730
it takes to travel along this
path for the velocity vector.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.310
So this is for the position
vector to travel like that.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.590
This is for the velocity
vector to travel like that.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.940
So it's going to be
the exact same T.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.990
And what is the
length of this path?

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.749
And now think of it in the
purely geometrical sense.

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:16.040
We're looking at a circle here.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.030
The radius of the circle
is v. So the length

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.640
of this path right over
here is going to be 1/4.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.070
It is going to be-- I'll
do it in that same color

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.530
so you see the analogy--
it's equal to 1/4 times

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.180
the circumference of the circle.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.010
The circumference of
this circle is 2 pi times

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:35.730
the radius of the
circle, which is v.

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:39.200
Now what is nudging
it along this circle?

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.700
What is nudging it
along this path?

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.350
What is the analogy for
speed right over here?

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.710
Speed is what's nudging it
along the path over here.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:48.250
It is the magnitude of
the velocity vector.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.750
So what's nudging it along
this arc right over here

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.530
is the magnitude of the
acceleration vector.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:58.110
So it is going to be a sub c.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.400
And these times are going
to be the exact same thing.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.191
The amount of time it
takes for this vector

00:08:02.191 --> 00:08:04.060
to go like that, for
the position vector,

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.670
is the same amount of
time it takes the velocity

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:08.640
vector to go like that.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.310
So we can set these 2
things equal each other.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:19.030
So we get, on this side,
we get 1/4 2 pi r over v

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:28.730
is equal to 1/4 2 pi v over the
magnitude of our acceleration

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:29.900
vector.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.760
And now we can simplify
it a little bit.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.230
We can divide both sides by 1/4.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.150
Get rid of that.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.030
We can divide both sides
by 2 pi, get rid of that.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:37.960
Let me rewrite it.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.830
So then we get r/v
is equal to v over

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:43.510
the centripetal acceleration.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.370
And now you can cross multiply.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:50.020
And so you get v
times v. So I'm just

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.490
cross multiplying right
over here. v times v,

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.147
you get v squared, is
equal to a c times r.

00:08:56.147 --> 00:08:58.730
And cross multiplying, remember,
is really just the same thing

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.490
as multiplying both sides
by both denominators,

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.620
by multiplying both
sides times v and ac.

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:08.170
So it's not some magical thing.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:11.900
If you multiply both sides times
v and ac, these v's cancel out.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.700
These ac's cancel out.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:18.360
You get v times v is v squared,
is equal to a sub c times r.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.990
And now to solve
for the magnitude

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.300
of our centripetal
acceleration, you

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:30.290
just divide both sides by r.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.030
And you are left
with-- and I guess

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.740
we've earned a drum
roll now-- the magnitude

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.800
of our centripetal
acceleration is

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.470
equal to the magnitude,
our constant magnitude

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:41.410
of our velocity.

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:43.710
So this right here
is our speed, divided

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:46.370
by the radius of the circle.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:48.240
And we're done!
