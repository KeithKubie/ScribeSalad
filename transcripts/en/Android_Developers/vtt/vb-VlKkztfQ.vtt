00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.400
Framy  stimulates creativity

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.320
by allowing us to create animations and characters

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.840
using a wealth of real facial expressions

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.080
By clicking just few buttons

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.100
Framy can create movie-like effects

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.580
integrating and combining photos with video clips

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.800
However, Framy is not just a tool for producing videos

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.440
it is also a platform

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.620
to express yourself and your emotions

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.520
It’s a great channel to share your custom animations

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.300
and exchange stories from your imagination

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.020
with people all over the world.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.020
Google has a wealth of experience and tools

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.660
to help you build a successful app business

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.140
Google Play provided Framy

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.300
with a lot of useful ideas and advice.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.580
For example, Google Play recommends adopting Material Design

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.700
with enabled Framy to generate

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.780
a new design scheme

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.620
and a simple and unified workflow.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.140
In the creation of Framy

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.200
The developers also incorporated

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.420
Various services provided by Google

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.260
Such as Google stage rollout

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.040
Framy is an app that contained a lot of new innovative features

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.500
Through Google Staged Rollout.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.480
Framy can introduce new features

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.160
to a limited set of users

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.800
And according to their report

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.760
to revise the problem and improve

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.040
before releasing them to the public

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.720
Staged Rollouts is especially

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.400
useful for Framy in designing new experimental features

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.420
Framy also leveraged Google Cloud Test Lab.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.800
It enables Framy to test on multiple devices

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.900
which saves a lot of testing manpower and time.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.026
We can then make system adjustments according to device types

00:02:02.026 --> 00:02:05.420
therefore greatly improving user satisfaction

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.800
with our app performance

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.240
Amongst various Google features

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.580
Framy also adopted Google Translate

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.940
Which provided different language support

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.840
and minimal language barriers

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.000
on Framy’s social media platform.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.960
This resulted in a massive boost

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.700
to our user ratings

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.300
which increased from 3.5 to 4.1

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.040
and the number is still improving.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.640
In the future, Framy will continue to improve

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.180
and incorporate relevant Google services into its workflow

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.440
in order to make Framy

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.100
a unique, and user-friendly app that everyone can enjoy.
