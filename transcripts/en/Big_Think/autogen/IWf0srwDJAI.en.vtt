well you know obviously the public has a

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:10.990
well you know obviously the public has a
 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.090
well you know obviously the public has a
great interest when an earthquake

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.100
great interest when an earthquake
 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.369
great interest when an earthquake
happens and so we do our best best we

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:14.379
happens and so we do our best best we
 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:17.690
happens and so we do our best best we
can the questions tend to be repetitive

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:17.700
can the questions tend to be repetitive
 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.460
can the questions tend to be repetitive
almost always we get a question from

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470
almost always we get a question from
 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.310
almost always we get a question from
somebody about whether they can come see

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320
somebody about whether they can come see
 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.230
somebody about whether they can come see
the Richter scale do we have an example

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240
the Richter scale do we have an example
 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.660
the Richter scale do we have an example
of the Richter scale the Richter scale

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:27.670
of the Richter scale the Richter scale
 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.730
of the Richter scale the Richter scale
is of mathematical calculation in fact

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740
is of mathematical calculation in fact
 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.320
is of mathematical calculation in fact
seismologists don't use it anymore the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330
seismologists don't use it anymore the
 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.080
seismologists don't use it anymore the
only reason we give a Richter magnitude

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090
only reason we give a Richter magnitude
 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.040
only reason we give a Richter magnitude
frankly is for the press and the media

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050
frankly is for the press and the media
 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.570
frankly is for the press and the media
but we have much better ways of

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580
but we have much better ways of
 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.710
but we have much better ways of
measuring the energy of an earthquake

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720
measuring the energy of an earthquake
 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.170
measuring the energy of an earthquake
now but the second question that's

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180
now but the second question that's
 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.289
now but the second question that's
cropped up and it's fascinating in its

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:43.299
cropped up and it's fascinating in its
 

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:46.259
cropped up and it's fascinating in its
own right is that the first time I heard

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269
own right is that the first time I heard
 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.289
own right is that the first time I heard
it I thought it was a fluke but I've

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:49.299
it I thought it was a fluke but I've
 

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:51.600
it I thought it was a fluke but I've
heard it so many times since Haiti that

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610
heard it so many times since Haiti that
 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.729
heard it so many times since Haiti that
I wonder what's going on that is are

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739
I wonder what's going on that is are
 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.100
I wonder what's going on that is are
these earthquakes related to global

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110
these earthquakes related to global
 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.990
these earthquakes related to global
warming I'm serious about that I'd say

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000
warming I'm serious about that I'd say
 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.049
warming I'm serious about that I'd say
that most of the press and most of the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059
that most of the press and most of the
 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.270
that most of the press and most of the
public that have called in that that

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280
public that have called in that that
 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.149
public that have called in that that
didn't have specific domain knowledge

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159
didn't have specific domain knowledge
 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.880
didn't have specific domain knowledge
has asked us that question we also got

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890
has asked us that question we also got
 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.940
has asked us that question we also got
questions whether you know 2012 is

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950
questions whether you know 2012 is
 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.010
questions whether you know 2012 is
coming a couple years early we get that

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020
coming a couple years early we get that
 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.040
coming a couple years early we get that
sort of thing it's just the end of days

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050
sort of thing it's just the end of days
 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.390
sort of thing it's just the end of days
but I think it speaks to something more

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400
but I think it speaks to something more
 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.750
but I think it speaks to something more
interesting which is that earthquakes

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760
interesting which is that earthquakes
 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.030
interesting which is that earthquakes
and major disasters I have a certain

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040
and major disasters I have a certain
 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.460
and major disasters I have a certain
impact on the public consciousness and I

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470
impact on the public consciousness and I
 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.080
impact on the public consciousness and I
think earthquakes more so or even

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090
think earthquakes more so or even
 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.970
think earthquakes more so or even
volcanic eruptions more so than than

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980
volcanic eruptions more so than than
 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.520
volcanic eruptions more so than than
anything else you know we get a major

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530
anything else you know we get a major
 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.290
anything else you know we get a major
hurricane a few major hurricanes every

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300
hurricane a few major hurricanes every
 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.380
hurricane a few major hurricanes every
year we get floods every year there are

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390
year we get floods every year there are
 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.899
year we get floods every year there are
major disasters that caused an enormous

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909
major disasters that caused an enormous
 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.370
major disasters that caused an enormous
amount of economic damage and casualties

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380
amount of economic damage and casualties
 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.340
amount of economic damage and casualties
but yet we hear about them relatively

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350
but yet we hear about them relatively
 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.590
but yet we hear about them relatively
often and so we kind of think of that as

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600
often and so we kind of think of that as
 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.540
often and so we kind of think of that as
kind of background this is what the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550
kind of background this is what the
 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.660
kind of background this is what the
earth is doing to us but earthquakes

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670
earth is doing to us but earthquakes
 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.740
earth is doing to us but earthquakes
especially major ones are relatively

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750
especially major ones are relatively
 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.789
especially major ones are relatively
rare we get a few major ones a decade

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799
rare we get a few major ones a decade
 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.660
rare we get a few major ones a decade
particularly ones with huge numbers of

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670
particularly ones with huge numbers of
 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.229
particularly ones with huge numbers of
casualties and and the concept of an

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239
casualties and and the concept of an
 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.839
casualties and and the concept of an
earthquake that it shakes the firmament

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849
earthquake that it shakes the firmament
 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.660
earthquake that it shakes the firmament
that that that it removes your footing

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670
that that that it removes your footing
 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.360
that that that it removes your footing
that it could destroy everything in a

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370
that it could destroy everything in a
 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.710
that it could destroy everything in a
blink of an eye and that it is

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720
blink of an eye and that it is
 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.780
blink of an eye and that it is
unpredictable that it just

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790
unpredictable that it just
 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.789
unpredictable that it just
happens even if your rationale in a

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799
happens even if your rationale in a
 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.349
happens even if your rationale in a
scientific way even if you're rational

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359
scientific way even if you're rational
 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:32.819
scientific way even if you're rational
and even a theological sort of way you

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829
and even a theological sort of way you
 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:38.039
and even a theological sort of way you
get a it has to have some impact you

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049
get a it has to have some impact you
 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.660
get a it has to have some impact you
know the the response the scientific

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670
know the the response the scientific
 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.030
know the the response the scientific
response to the chile earthquake

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040
response to the chile earthquake
 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.530
response to the chile earthquake
although modulated a bit by the damage

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540
although modulated a bit by the damage
 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.849
although modulated a bit by the damage
and by the casualties still was this is

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859
and by the casualties still was this is
 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.379
and by the casualties still was this is
a major earthquake we've got to look at

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389
a major earthquake we've got to look at
 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.240
a major earthquake we've got to look at
this as well as we can because we only

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250
this as well as we can because we only
 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.129
this as well as we can because we only
get a couple of shots a decade to look

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139
get a couple of shots a decade to look
 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.339
get a couple of shots a decade to look
at this so now there are teams of

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349
at this so now there are teams of
 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.990
at this so now there are teams of
scientists and lots of instrumentation

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000
scientists and lots of instrumentation
 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.780
scientists and lots of instrumentation
going to Chile but when you get down to

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790
going to Chile but when you get down to
 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.159
going to Chile but when you get down to
Haiti or something like Haiti when you

Haiti or something like Haiti when you
 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:07.610
Haiti or something like Haiti when you
get a directed on a capital city when

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620
get a directed on a capital city when
 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.550
get a directed on a capital city when
the the bulk of the nation is affected

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560
the the bulk of the nation is affected
 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.750
the the bulk of the nation is affected
where you have damage that far exceeds

where you have damage that far exceeds
 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.960
where you have damage that far exceeds
their economic ability to to come back

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970
 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.149
coupled with the fact that an earthquake

coupled with the fact that an earthquake
 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.009
coupled with the fact that an earthquake
literally moves the ground on which your

sorts of questions I things have such a
big impact on the public that by

of course in a very quantitative

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049
of course in a very quantitative
 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.779
of course in a very quantitative
scientific way but how do you how do you

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789
scientific way but how do you how do you
 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.729
scientific way but how do you how do you
approach that person how do you assure

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739
approach that person how do you assure
 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.480
approach that person how do you assure
them that the situation has a rational

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490
them that the situation has a rational
 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.610
them that the situation has a rational
response now I don't think we have a

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620
response now I don't think we have a
 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.550
response now I don't think we have a
good way to deal with that so a lot of

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560
good way to deal with that so a lot of
 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.219
good way to deal with that so a lot of
the questions we were getting and a lot

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229
the questions we were getting and a lot
 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:33.850
the questions we were getting and a lot
of the

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860
of the
 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.689
of the
thinking that generated had to do with

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699
thinking that generated had to do with
 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.270
thinking that generated had to do with
these central questions of what does

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280
these central questions of what does
 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.339
these central questions of what does
this mean particularly for the future of

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:42.349
this mean particularly for the future of
 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:43.899
this mean particularly for the future of
Haiti but what does this mean when we

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:43.909
Haiti but what does this mean when we
 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:46.959
Haiti but what does this mean when we
talk about taking steps to mitigate

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:46.969
talk about taking steps to mitigate
 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:49.149
talk about taking steps to mitigate
against future tragedy future disasters

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:49.159
against future tragedy future disasters
 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:51.040
against future tragedy future disasters
not just for earthquakes what for the

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050
not just for earthquakes what for the
 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.689
not just for earthquakes what for the
other major natural disasters as well

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699
other major natural disasters as well
 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:57.850
other major natural disasters as well
and to me that and many of us i should

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860
and to me that and many of us i should
 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.879
and to me that and many of us i should
say it's not that we haven't thought

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889
say it's not that we haven't thought
 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.730
say it's not that we haven't thought
about this before but it seems to me to

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740
about this before but it seems to me to
 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.219
about this before but it seems to me to
be an area not just of research but of

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229
be an area not just of research but of
 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.629
be an area not just of research but of
so it's sort of a way to link directly

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639
so it's sort of a way to link directly
 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.409
so it's sort of a way to link directly
to the public directly to the people who

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419
to the public directly to the people who
 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:15.999
to the public directly to the people who
need to understand what it is we're

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:16.009
need to understand what it is we're
 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:20.350
need to understand what it is we're
doing as scientists and I could I can

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360
doing as scientists and I could I can
 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.339
doing as scientists and I could I can
make the same sort of argument about

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349
make the same sort of argument about
 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.529
make the same sort of argument about
climate change for example but the

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:23.539
climate change for example but the
 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:27.670
climate change for example but the
earthquakes serve I use a phrase and I

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680
earthquakes serve I use a phrase and I
 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.769
earthquakes serve I use a phrase and I
don't mean to use it lightly but

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:29.779
don't mean to use it lightly but
 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:32.980
don't mean to use it lightly but
earthquake service training days for the

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990
earthquake service training days for the
 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.200
earthquake service training days for the

faces and if we can begin to address how

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:41.779
faces and if we can begin to address how
 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:43.930
faces and if we can begin to address how
we relate to the public how we provide

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940
we relate to the public how we provide
 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.790
we relate to the public how we provide
assurance how we help the public to

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800
assurance how we help the public to
 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.409
assurance how we help the public to
understand what it is it happening them

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419
understand what it is it happening them
 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.480
understand what it is it happening them
if we can understand how to do that for

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490
if we can understand how to do that for
 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.559
if we can understand how to do that for
major earthquakes or major hurricanes

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:55.569
major earthquakes or major hurricanes
 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:57.670
major earthquakes or major hurricanes
then perhaps we can do something about

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680
then perhaps we can do something about
 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.369
then perhaps we can do something about
stuff that's even more merger the major

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:00.379
stuff that's even more merger the major
 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:04.240

to do something about it so what I've

admit it's not new to this earthquake

we've had it before with the Indonesian

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050
we've had it before with the Indonesian

we've seen it earthquakes going as far

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610
we've seen it earthquakes going as far
 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.839
we've seen it earthquakes going as far
back as the 80s and the 70s and places

what we've taken away from this is that
there's a conversation that scientists

00:06:40.269 --> 00:06:40.279
there's a conversation that scientists
 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:43.449
there's a conversation that scientists
have to have with the public that the

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:43.459
have to have with the public that the
 

00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:45.239
have to have with the public that the
public will regard as deep

00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:45.249
public will regard as deep

public will regard as deep
meaningful which means we can't just

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:48.729
meaningful which means we can't just
 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:50.369
meaningful which means we can't just
throw our results over the fence we

00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:50.379
throw our results over the fence we
 

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:52.679
throw our results over the fence we
can't just stick with our technical

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:52.689
can't just stick with our technical
 

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:54.899
can't just stick with our technical
journals there's got to be some other

00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:54.909
journals there's got to be some other
 

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:59.399
journals there's got to be some other
mechanism and in my view I think

00:06:59.399 --> 00:06:59.409
mechanism and in my view I think
 

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:03.959

to do it and i think the universities
have that kind of role to play beyond

have that kind of role to play beyond
