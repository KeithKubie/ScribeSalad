00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:04.604
As we go to our next game,
2 in the Walls, 8 in the Balls.

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:11.844
Etsy finally has found
a solution to all those times

00:00:11.877 --> 00:00:13.913
you've been shoving things
in your ass while wondering

00:00:13.946 --> 00:00:17.917
what lies ahead in your future,
a Magic 8-Ball plug.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.255
-Oh. "Reply hazy,
ass again later." -Hey!

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:23.790
This item is listed on Etsy

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:27.060
for a surprisingly
reasonable price of 30 bucks.

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:28.728
-30 U.S. dollars.
-That's not...

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:31.064
-You can't get a butt plug
that cheap, man. -No!

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:35.735
Like, it sucks that the future's
attached to it, but still.

00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:38.137
One has to wonder
what fortunes will be told

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.073
on the Magic 8-Ball
that powers your ass.

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:41.874
I would like you to come up
with as many Magic 8-Ball

00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:44.544
butt plug fortunes
as you can in 60 seconds.

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:46.546
Please begin. Matt Mira.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.047
Moist likely.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.049
Points. Brian Posehn.

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:52.385
Outlook foggy.
Nope, that's just (bleep).

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:54.587
Poi... Points.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.922
Points. Brian Posehn.

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:57.323
Your future stinks.

00:00:57.356 --> 00:01:00.560
Points. Brian Posehn again.

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:03.563
-It's a living!
-Points, yes.

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:05.832
-With the Flintstones, it would
be, like, a lizard -Yeah.

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:07.500
on the back of a stick.

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.435
Yeah. Points. Matt Mira.

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:11.971
If you're sliding into first
and you feel something burst...

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:13.973
it is certain.

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:15.374
Points.

00:01:15.407 --> 00:01:17.043
Well-well played. Kevin.

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:18.711
Can't see. Poo over.

00:01:18.744 --> 00:01:21.114
Points. Matt Mira.

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:22.280
My reply is yeah!
