Speaker 1:          00:00          Called the four hour work week, escape the nine to five live anywhere and join the new rich and enjoys this line this morning from New York. Good morning. Good morning. Catchy title. I gotta tell you this, but can anyone really have a successful career at a productive business on just four hours a week? Are the surprising answers? Yes. If you'd asked me in 2002, I would've said no. I put in the usual 8,200 hour, quite literally workweeks in Silicon Valley, first as an employee and then as a CEO, but a part of giving my guest lectures at Princeton University and high tech entrepreneurship led me to question a lot of those assumptions about career and work life balance. And after 20 countries and dozens of case studies, the conclusion was yes, it can be done. And it's really in a world where the average work week is now 70 hours. According to Forbes, the, the option is either up or down.

Speaker 1:          00:57          And I think a lot of people want to go down. A lot of people want to go down, goes according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Um, more Americans are working longer and longer than we ever have, or we have just as obsessed with the job that we are obsessed with getting ahead or do we not understand how to work more effectively and efficiently. I think that there are a number of issues. Um, we have a certain dedication in the u s to hyperactivity. So it's a real fixation on, on activity and being busy as opposed to being productive. And when you sit down and you look at how, let's say Richard Branson, the CEO version works, uh, or you look at, uh, the CEO of let's say Ikea, you notice that there are some distinct differences in how they operate. They and we all have the same 24 hours.

Speaker 1:          01:40          So when you break it down, you see that even someone like Branson says he can handle his business in the first 15 minutes of each day if you prioritize this properly. All right, but for most, go ahead. And I want to get to some of the examples because we, when you talk about, uh, cutting down a of the amount of time, we don't have that much time. So let's talk about this. You say Americans can't eliminate 50% of their work in the first 48 hours, 50% of their work in their, in just 48 hours. Tell us how that's possible too. So the first thing you need to do is define their work very clearly on, and Peter Drucker said this was the biggest challenge. So what, how is my performance being measured? Uh, once you do that, you wanted to do an 80 20 analysis and two ways.

Speaker 1:          02:20          So the first, as you look at the 20% of activities that are really contributing 80% of the desired outcomes. And then conversely, you look at the 20% of people and activities that are consuming 80% of your time and then work to minimize or eliminate those. And the effects can be quite dramatic, especially when we cut out a lot of the email distraction that people are addicted to your socio. You're saying focus, focus, focus. In the book you mentioned trading your boss to value a performance over presence mean let's look at the final product as opposed to the amount of time I spent at the desk in the cubicle or in the office. That's exactly exactly right, so moving from a a presence based model, where are you measuring ass and seat time so to speak, to a performance and results based model. And so when I've spoken to companies like Google and paypal and others, they're already moving in that direction.

Speaker 1:          03:10          But even as an employee you can help catalyze some of those changes on a personal level and really train your boss to look at your output as opposed to just the hours that you're putting in your eyes. So don't worry about how much time I spent at the office. We'll look at the final product in the book. You also say we should go to the media fast for one week and not be anything. Turn off the TV, magazines, newspapers, et Cetera, except focusing on your book is that seems a little dangerous to have people live in a vacuum. But are you saying this will help us to focus on our task? It's a no, you're exactly right. It's not so much operating in a vacuum, but recognizing that in a digital world you'll always have less attention than information that's imposed on you. So, uh, going on a low information diet and blocking out the things that are either irrelevant to your, your objectives or in actionable, which happens to be most things.

Speaker 1:          04:00          So really reestablishing those barriers and filters is key to a single tasking, so to speak. All right. And when you, I guess we were saying once you, once you accomplish this, but can you join the new rich, I mean, will you be able to find yourself getting the pay raises and the increases that you, that you, that you think you've earned and deserve? I absolutely envy the keyword being earned. So, uh, you'll find that as soon as you start living a lifestyle and a career by design, it's not only possible to increase your output while decreasing the input, but it's really mandatory because people will abuse your time to the extent that you let them. And time is really what makes your income valuable or not valuable. All right, Tim Ferriss, he's the author of the four hour work week and escape the nine to five live anywhere.
