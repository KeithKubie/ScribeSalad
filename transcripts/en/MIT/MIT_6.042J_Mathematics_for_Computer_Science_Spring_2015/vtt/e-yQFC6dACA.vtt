00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:02.450
PROFESSOR: One of the most
important applications

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.720
of conditional probability
is in analyzing

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.260
the results of diagnostic
tests of uncertain reliability.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.520
So let's look at a
fundamental example.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.082
Suppose that I have a diagnostic
test for tuberculosis.

00:00:19.082 --> 00:00:20.540
It really sounds
great because it's

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.710
going to be 99% accurate--
in fact, more than 99%

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.250
accurate, really,
because here are

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.050
the properties this test has.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.710
If you have TB, this test
is guaranteed to detect it

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.190
and say, yes, you have TB.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.660
If you don't have
TB, 99% of the time,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.550
the test says correctly
that you don't

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.390
have TB, and 1% of the
time, it gets it wrong.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.520
Now, suppose the doctor gives
you the test and the test

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.630
comes up saying
that you have TB.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.110
That's kind of scary
because TB is, in fact,

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.180
quite a serious disease.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.680
It's getting worse
because there are

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.250
all of these
antibiotic-resistant versions

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.030
of TB.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.110
Now in Asia, where all the
known antibiotics are not

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.410
very effective-- if effective
at all-- of curing it,

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.370
and this test that
was 99% accurate

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.090
says I have this disease,
it sounds really worrisome.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.652
But in fact, we can
ask more technically,

00:01:19.652 --> 00:01:20.860
should you really be worried?

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.930
What is the probability given
that this apparently highly

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.700
accurate test says you have TB?

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.800
What's the probability
that you actually have TB?

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.630
That's what we
want to calculate.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.220
What's the probability
that you have it?

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.900
So in other words, I want
the conditional probability

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.825
that I have TB given that
the test comes in positive.

00:01:39.825 --> 00:01:44.210
The test says, yes, you have TB.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.114
That test positive is a big
word that I won't have room

00:01:47.114 --> 00:01:48.530
for on other slides,
so let's just

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.380
abbreviate it by
[? plus. ?] Plus means,

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.470
in green, that the test said,
yes, positive-- you have TB.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.790
OK, so that's the
probability that we're

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.090
trying to calculate, this
conditional probability.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.440
What do we know about the test?

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.030
Let's translate
the information we

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.950
have about the test
into the language

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.400
of conditional probability.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.210
And the first thing we said
was that the test is guaranteed

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.980
to get it right if you have TB.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.560
So given that you have
TB, the probability

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.380
that the test will say so-- it
will return a positive result--

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.060
is 1.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.820
Given that you don't
have TB, the probability

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.370
that the test will say that you
do have TB is only 1 in 100.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.920
Because 99% of the
time, it correctly

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.030
says you don't have TB.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.530
And 1% of the time, it
says oops, you do have TB.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.800
So this is what's called
a false positive rate.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.510
It's falsely claiming that you
have TB when you really don't.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.430
And that rate, we're
hypothesizing, is only 1%.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.150
Now, what we're
trying to calculate,

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.870
again, is the probability
that you have TB

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.494
given that the test came in
positive and said you had TB.

00:02:56.494 --> 00:02:57.910
Well, let's look
at the definition

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.034
of conditional probability.

00:02:59.034 --> 00:03:02.260
The probability that you have
TB given that the test came

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.050
in positive, that said you
do, is simply the probability

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.220
that both the test
comes in positive

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.640
and you have TB divided
by the probability

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.330
that the test comes in positive.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.110
Well, using the definition of
conditional probability again,

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.580
this intersection, this AND
of having TB and the test

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.040
coming in positive, is
simply the probability

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.070
that the test comes
in positive given

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.680
that you have TB times the
probability that you have TB.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.330
Now, this one we know.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.390
It's 1 because the
test is perfect.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.980
If you have TB, the
test is definitely

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.200
going to say positive.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.600
So that lets me
simplify things nicely.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.220
What I've just figured
out is the probability

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.860
that you have TB given
that the test says

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.180
you do is simply the
quotient of the probability

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.570
that you have TB given no other
information and the probability

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.310
that the test comes in positive.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.490
Well, what is that
probability that the test

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:04.240
comes in positive?

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.698
How are we going
to calculate that?

00:04:05.698 --> 00:04:08.197
That's the key unknown here.

00:04:08.197 --> 00:04:10.030
And we're going to use
the probability rule,

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.730
the total probability rule.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.700
Total probability says that
you do or you don't have TB.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.240
So that the way to calculate the
probability that the test comes

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.700
in positive is to look
at the probability

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.110
that the test comes in positive
when you do and don't have TB.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.040
And we know those numbers.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.600
So let's look at the
total probability formula.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.900
The probability that the
test comes in positive

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.710
is simply the probability
that it comes in positive

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.020
if you have TB times the
probability you have TB,

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.470
plus the probability
it comes in positive

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.540
given that you don't have TB
times the probability you don't

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.690
have TB.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.570
Well, we know a
lot of these terms.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.005
Let's work them out.

00:04:50.005 --> 00:04:53.350
Well, the probability the
test comes in positive

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.110
given that you have TB is 1.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.830
And the probability
that the test

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.059
comes in positive given that
you don't have TB is 1/100.

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:02.350
That's the false positive rate.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.720
We figured that already.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.120
What about the probability
that you don't have TB?

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.560
Well, that's simply 1
minus the probability

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.560
that you do have TB.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.580
Now I have this nice
arithmetic formula

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.490
in the probability of TB.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.250
So I wind up with
the probability

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.450
of TB plus 1/100
minus [? 1/100 ?]

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.750
of the probability of TB.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.270
It leaves me with 1/100
plus the 99/100 of TB.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.360
So that's what
this simplifies to.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.040
The probability
that the test comes

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.100
in positive given
no other information

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.410
is 99/100 of the
probability that a person

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.960
has TB plus 1/100.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.740
We'll come back to this formula.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.820
Well, we were working
on the probability

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.932
that you have TB given
the test came in positive.

00:05:52.932 --> 00:05:54.640
We figured out that
it was this quotient.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.910
And now, I know what
the denominator is.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.850
The denominator is 99/100
times the probability

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.070
of TB plus 1/100.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.780
Multiply numerator and
denominator through by 100,

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.970
and you get that the
probability that you have TB

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.730
given that the test says you
do is 100 times the probability

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:16.450
that you have TB divided by 99
times the probability that you

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.580
have TB plus 1.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.870
So let's hold formula.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.320
Notice the key unknown
here is the probability

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.720
that you have TB independent
of the test, the probability

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.680
that a random person in
the population has TB.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.400
If we can figure that out
or if we can look that up,

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.470
then we know what
this unknown is,

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.550
the probability have TB given
that the test says you do.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:45.000
Well, what is the probability
that a random person has TB?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.840
Well, there were 11,000 cases of
TB reported in 2011, according

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.510
to the Center for Disease
Control in the United States.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.170
And you can assume
that there's going

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.200
to be a lot of unreported
cases if there are 11,000

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.940
reported ones, because
a lot of people

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.820
don't even know they
have the disease.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.930
So let's estimate, on that
basis given that the population

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:13.310
of the US is around 350 million,
that the probability of TB is

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.000
about 1/10,000.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.490
Let's plug that
into our formula.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.510
The probability that you have
TB given the test is positive

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:22.500
is this formula.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.510
When I plug in 1/10,000 for TB.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:31.760
I get 100/10,000 and
99/10,000 plus 1.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.200
Well now, I can see that the
denominator is essentially 1.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.800
It's 1.01.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.370
And the numerator is 1/100.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.530
And this is basically
about 1/100.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:46.370
In other words, it's not
very likely that you have TB.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.720
Because of the relatively
high false positive rate

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.930
that was relatively high of
1%, that false positive rate

00:07:53.930 --> 00:08:01.180
washed out the actual number of
TB cases, which the TB rate was

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:07.590
only 0.01%, so that almost
all of the reports of TB

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:10.390
were caused by the high
false positive rate.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:14.350
And that means that when you
have a report that you've

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:18.180
got TB, you still only have
a 1% chance that you actually

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.590
have the TB.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:23.860
So the 99% accurate
test was not very useful

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.725
here for you to figure out
what kind of action to take

00:08:26.725 --> 00:08:28.100
and what kind of
medicine to take

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.350
or treatment to take given
that the test came in positive.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.310
With 1 in 100
chance, the odds are

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:34.809
you won't do anything,
in which case

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:37.850
you can wonder why your
doctor gave you the test.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.330
Well, the 99% test sounds good.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:41.620
We figured out that it isn't.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:46.330
And a hint about why 99%
accurate isn't really so useful

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:50.290
is that there's an obvious
test that's 99.99% accurate.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:51.600
What's the test?

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.990
Always say no.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.390
After all, the probability
is only 1 in 10,000

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:57.890
that you're going to be wrong.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:02.150
And that's the 99.99% rate.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.530
So it sounds as though this
test is really worthless.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:06.600
But no, it's not.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.754
If you think about it a
little bit, it will be useful.

00:09:10.754 --> 00:09:12.170
And I'll explain
that in a minute.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:13.711
I forgot I'm getting
ahead of myself.

00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:17.050
Because the basic formula
that we used here was we

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:20.380
figured out what the
probability of TB

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:24.030
given that the test
said you had TB in terms

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.490
of the inverse probabilities
which we knew-- that is,

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.560
the probability that the
test came in positive given

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.710
that you had TB.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.085
This is an example of what's
a famous rule in probability

00:09:34.085 --> 00:09:34.585
theory.

00:09:34.585 --> 00:09:36.740
It's called Bayes'
rule, or Bayes' law.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:37.590
And this is it.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.270
It's just stated in terms
of arbitrary events A and B.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.200
It expresses the
probability of B

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.920
given A in terms of the
probability of A given

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.967
B and the probabilities
of A and B independently.

00:09:48.967 --> 00:09:50.800
Now, I can actually
never remember this law,

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.350
but I re-derive it
right every time

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:55.910
I need to do it as we've
done in the previous slides.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.760
It's really a quite
straightforward law

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.890
to derive and prove.

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:02.784
But let's go back to this
99% accurate test that

00:10:02.784 --> 00:10:04.950
seemed worthless since there
was a trivial test that

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.820
was 99.9% accurate.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.400
But in fact, it's really
helpful because it

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.590
did increase the
probability that you

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.770
had TB by a factor of 100.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:17.429
Before you took the test and
before you know anything,

00:10:17.429 --> 00:10:18.970
you thought that
your probability was

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.806
the same as everybody
elses-- about 1 in 10,000.

00:10:21.806 --> 00:10:23.180
Now the test says
the probability

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.566
that you have TB is 1 in 100.

00:10:25.566 --> 00:10:27.040
That's a hundred times larger.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.560
What's the value of that?

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.990
Well, suppose you only had
5 million doses of medicine

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:36.310
to treat this American
population of 350

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:37.990
million people.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:39.950
Who should you medicate?

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:43.910
Well, if you medicated a
random 5 million people

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.230
out of 350 million,
the likelihood

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.840
that you're going to get very
many of the real TB cases

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.860
is small.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.440
It's only going to
be about 1 in 30.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.050
You'll only get about
1/30 of the cases.

00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:00.710
But if you use your
5 million doses

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:05.620
to medicate the 3.5 million
people who would test positive

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:10.660
under this 99%
accurate test, then

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.760
when you test all
350 million people,

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.560
you're going to get about 3.5
million who test positive.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.940
You have enough medication
to treat all of them.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.470
And if you treat
all of them, you're

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:23.720
almost certain to get all of
the actual TB cases, all 10,000

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.730
of them.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:28.350
So the 99% accurate test
does have an important use

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.240
in this final
setting, a lot more

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:35.640
so then the 99.99% accurate
test that simply always said

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.530
no-- food for thought.
