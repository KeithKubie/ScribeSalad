00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.420
The Armenian Genocide was one of the

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.560
most heavily reported topics during

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.060
World War I in the United States.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.700
There's an attempt to crush and suppress

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.500
the story into oblivion.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.860
We were the beneficiaries of looking at other

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.320
projects and other attempts to make a

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.780
film about the Armenian Genocide.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.020
The combination of Eric's belief and I could

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.079
see it in him that he wanted to get this

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.750
movie made and the subject-matter itself

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.000
begged the question okay well how do you tell that story.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.980
The universality of these

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.540
human stories appeals to people

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.460
from all walks of life and from all faiths.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.020
It's a movie that that I knew was

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.660
going to resonate forever.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.680
I think as part of the Bruin family it's really

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.860
amazing to see the campus rally not just

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.690
about the project but around everything

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.330
that it touches such as human rights and

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.040
intolerance and the treatment of

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.930
refugees and the treatment of immigrants

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.990
it's an opportunity for us to use the

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.480
medium of film and storytelling to

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.580
remind people that they can actually be

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.960
active participants.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.240
We realize how we  have a responsibility to not

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.520
only raise awareness about the Armenian Genocide

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.720
but to then try to remind people that

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.400
these types of atrocities are occurring

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.780
in the world today.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.880
Doing this has become another kind of really

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.260
important moment in my life because it

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
tells me this is why I do this.
