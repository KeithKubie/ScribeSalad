00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.230
- Welcome back.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.660
This is the third panel.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.640
I'm Eve Blau, the moderator
of the third panel.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.350
And this panel is about the
planned and the unplanned.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.010
So the concern of
this panel is with

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.710
the complex and
intertwined relationship

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.010
between planned and
unplanned processes

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.500
of urban environments--

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.570
in urban environments, actually.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.190
And the central
question that will

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.590
be addressed by the panelists--

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.320
from different
disciplinary perspectives,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.130
from different geographies
and professional practices--

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.950
is basically, what
is that relationship,

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.730
and what should it be?

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.060
Now I want to say a few
words just about the topic,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.540
and frame the
session a little bit.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.940
It's very often the
case, as we all know,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.780
that official city plans are
not realized in their proposed

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.280
forms.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.170
Plans are, by definition,
projective and propositional.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.790
They tend to be
aspirational, no matter

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.350
their claims to pragmatism.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.400
And they are always political
and always contested,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.070
as we saw in the last panel.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.680
In order to be realized,
therefore, they

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.400
require some buy in
from stakeholders.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.180
But they also have to adapt
to realities on the ground,

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.040
including informal practices
and patterns of human behavior

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.820
that are deeply embedded in
the social and built fabric

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.980
of urban environments.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.370
As a result, plan
change inevitably

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.130
produces unanticipated outcomes.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.970
So what is the relationship
between the planned

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.920
and the unplanned?

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.610
In the early 20th century, when
planning, or town planning,

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.040
as it was called
at the time, first

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.190
became a professional practice
and administrative function

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.990
of government in Europe
and the US in particular,

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.070
the purpose of planning was
to control urban development

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.950
in the interests
of the common good,

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.700
by imposing a modest
amount of order,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.480
and providing infrastructural
support to direct and encourage

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.750
private and usually
speculative development

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.990
of the urban
terrain, and to do so

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.900
without challenging
the bourgeois sanctity

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.150
of private property.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.050
It was, planning,
and remains a system

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.000
that has always left
considerable wiggle

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.200
room for unregulated,
unplanned interventions.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.410
In fact, I would say that
even the most rigidly

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.790
prescriptive modernist plans,
with their rationalized grids,

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.730
their rigorously
zoned land uses,

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.890
and robust infrastructures, seem
to not only enable, but also

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.160
to accommodate
comfortably a great deal

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.630
of informal and unplanned
extralegal intervention

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.630
and activity.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.010
In other words, the relationship
between planned and unplanned

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.140
urban processes is neither
dichotomous nor oppositional.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.240
Instead, it is one
of entanglement

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.370
and interdependency.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.950
It is even symbiotic.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.260
Now in recent years,
and this is what

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.970
we will be looking
at in this panel,

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.020
that relationship has begun
to morph in ways that we

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.480
don't yet fully understand.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.820
The effects of
economic liberalization

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.830
and globalization and
new patterns of migration

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.250
are seriously challenging
normative planning methods

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.480
and destablizing the processes
by which they operate.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.420
In many parts of the
world, as we'll see,

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.670
urban processes
are predominantly

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.670
informal and unplanned.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.670
And in general, I would say,
in both the global South

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.160
and the global
North, one thing that

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.770
does seem clear that
is happening now

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.990
is that new actors
are determining

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.470
the economic and spatial
organization of cities.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.160
In particular,
multinational corporations

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.710
are assuming roles that
were previously played

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.350
by state and local governments.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.390
Together with
investment banks, they

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.810
are financing urban
development around the world.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.230
In the process, planning
is taking a backseat

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.360
to private development.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.490
One could call this
the informality

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.750
of the powerful, as opposed
to the informal practices

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.900
of subsistence and
survival of the powerless.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.200
As a result, the ways in which
cities are being organized,

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.860
managed, and built and
the political processes

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.560
by which their long term
social agendas are set

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.720
are being radically disrupted.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.660
These conditions give rise
to a series of questions that

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.850
are the subject of this panel.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.300
They include-- what are the
planned and unplanned dynamics

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.040
in cities today?

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.350
How do they structure
life and opportunities

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.330
for urban dwellers?

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.210
How can we act on
that knowledge?

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.800
And in particular, how can we
begin to think projectively

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.320
about restructuring that
relationship in ways that

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.370
might give increased agency
and opportunity to the less

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.270
powerful members of society?

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.630
Each of our panelists
will speak to these issues

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.850
from their own
disciplinary perspectives

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.710
and will draw on
their own practices

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.070
in a range of different urban
and geographical contexts.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.590
The first speaker, our first
speaker is Edgar Pieterse.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.170
Edgar Pieterse is an
urban scholar and writer

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.410
who holds the South African
Research chair in Urban Policy

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.560
at the University of
Cape Town in South Africa

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.650
and is the director of the
African Center for Cities.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.070
His research is rooted
in sub-Saharan Africa

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.160
and focuses on urban
development, politics,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.640
everyday culture, public's
responsive design,

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.890
and adaptive governance systems.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.920
These concerns in
sub-Saharan Africa

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.790
will be the focus
of his talk today.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.380
Ana Elvira Velez is an
architect based in Medellin,

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.510
Columbia and is a professor
of Urban and Environmental

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:37.000
Processes at [INAUDIBLE]
Universidad [INAUDIBLE] ah--

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.220
Columbia.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.060
I tried.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.130
In Medellin, she
has been involved

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.560
in the extraordinary
and much celebrated

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.390
regeneration of the
city, where she has also

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.860
designed collective housing and
public space, about which she

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.930
will talk today.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.380
And our third speaker
who is in the ether

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.910
is Ricky Burdett, who will be
actually joining us by video,

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:08.740
I believe, and various
other remote means.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.640
He unfortunately
had a conflict that

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.380
came up in the very
last minute and was

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.020
unable to be here today.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.850
Ricky Burdett is a professor
of Urban Studies at the London

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.800
School of Economics,
where he directs

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.990
the LSE Cities and the
Urban Age Program in London.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.150
In addition to teaching
and publishing,

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.110
he's involved in regeneration
projects across Europe,

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.290
and he was chief adviser on
architecture and urbanism

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:45.130
for the London 2012 Olympics
and architectural adviser

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.600
to the Mayor of London, who was
Ken Livingston at that time.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.020
And his presentation
today will focus on London

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.170
and will draw on
that experience.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:00.220
So please join me in
welcoming the panelists

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.490
and our first speaker,
Edgar Pieterse.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:12.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:13.950
- Thank you very much,
Eve, and thank you

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:17.250
to the Radcliffe Institute
for the invitation, hugely

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.170
exciting to be here.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:25.410
And I must confess, I'm
feeling a little out of sorts,

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.080
because today has
been incredible.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.890
My brain has been
absolutely blown away.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.860
And I kind of wish that the
talks were slightly less

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.360
interesting, so
that I could quickly

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.620
do another talk to kind of stay
within the spirit of the day

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.030
so far.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.860
So it sort of feels
a little bit odd

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.110
that I'm going to
be sort of more

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.190
on the practice and the
very concrete planning side.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:54.510
I'm totally seduced by the
humanities tenure of the talks

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:55.110
so far.

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.680
So thank you very much to
my fellow speakers today.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.790
It's been really wonderful.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.190
I need the gizmo, got the gizmo.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.850
Gizmo works, fantastic, as
everything else, by the way.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.920
Some people are so organized.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:16.840
So I'm going to try and cover
an impossibly complex and highly

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:21.680
nuanced topic in a very
short space of time.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.670
So I'm going to do it
in these three moves.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:28.390
And in some ways I'm going to
go over fairly familiar ground

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:31.450
for probably a lot of
people in the room in terms

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:34.360
of the informal
nature of urbanization

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.480
in the sub-Saharan
African continent.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.740
But in some ways, these trends
and patterns are so stark,

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.950
we have to continuously
revisit and re-inhabit

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:48.340
these trends to really
remind ourselves

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.800
that the informal
is in fact the norm,

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.790
and what we regard as modern
urbanization is something

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:57.430
of a distant mirage
for most urban dwellers

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.230
across the continent.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:03.190
I'll try and point
to what's at stake

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:07.060
in the question of the panel
by very briefly showing you

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:11.260
images of two cities, Cape
Town and Accra in Ghana.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:15.580
And then conclude my talk with
responding to the provocation

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.950
that Eve has put forward around
can we think propositionally

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.550
and what form might
that take, and how

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:24.850
do we re-imagine what
planning could become,

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:25.960
if we should do so.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.160
We've heard this
morning in Liz's opening

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.340
remarks of the scale and
the sort of dramatic nature

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.200
of urbanization.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.920
95% of all urban growth
over the next 35 years

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.130
will take place in
Asia and Africa.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.440
The important part
for the African story

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.510
is that it's not
just urban growth,

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:52.230
but rural areas are also
growing because of an incredibly

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.440
fertile demographic
transition that we are still

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.330
caught up in at the moment.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:02.190
So in some ways, it is always a
conceit and extremely dangerous

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:05.550
to speak about Africa as if it
is a geographical entity that

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:07.110
has coherence.

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:09.360
This is work that I did
with the African Development

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.820
Bank and the OACD
two years ago, where

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.670
we tried to build a typology
to try and at least begin

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:19.080
to help us think through
the incredible diversity

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.910
across the continent.

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.650
The detail of this
is not so important.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.240
The last row shows
you the number

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.550
of countries that fall
into each of the categories

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:27.990
of the typology.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:29.700
But if you look at
the fertility numbers,

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:33.180
that's really what I want
to draw your attention to.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.950
Except for the
five countries that

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:37.520
have got a highly
diversified economy,

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.270
you're still sitting
with a fertility rate

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:42.570
of about five children
per female in most

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:45.810
of these geographies, and
of course, very, very low

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.580
incomes per capita.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.047
The structural element
in the African story,

00:11:50.047 --> 00:11:52.380
and that drives a lot of the
informality we're concerned

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.040
with, is the labor force.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.230
So in 2010, after a decade
of average GDP growth

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:02.130
of around 6.5%,
we're still at 63%

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.380
of the labor force caught
up in what the ILO calls

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.110
vulnerable employment.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:11.790
This is, oddly enough, it's a
different statistical category

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.470
to the idea of
informal employment.

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.240
I can talk about it
in discussion time.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.970
But if we shift register
and look at informality,

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.030
you will see that, from the
selection of African cities

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:24.570
there, which is a gendered
breakdown, that it

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:29.970
is by far the predominant and
the normal condition for how

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:30.840
people--

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.850
adult citizens in urban areas--

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.940
access economic life
and livelihoods.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.370
However, it is not unique
to sub-Saharan Africa.

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:41.220
It is a condition that, in fact,
is more pronounced in Eastern

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.980
South Asia, as you can see
from the data, or South Asia,

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.140
from the data there,
but also Latin American

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.110
or other geographies
of the global South.

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:51.720
The point, though, that is
important to keep in mind,

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.480
because urban
living is expensive,

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:59.250
is that wages are both extremely
low and they're highly erratic.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.670
So it really complicates
the livelihood strategies

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:06.330
people need to deploy to
keep a toehold in the city.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.280
Now what's going on there?

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.280
Despite impressive
GDP growth, we're

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.040
seeing a very bizarre
phenomenon in Africa

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.190
where there's a disconnect
between what we've

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:21.840
come to expect as a kind
of conventional evolution

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.910
of economic incorporation.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:27.090
So there is no industrial
middle being built.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.820
We're going straight from
agricultural economies

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.900
into services
dominated economies.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.130
And so if you look at the decade
and a half of high growth,

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:38.770
it is only in the services
sector in sub-Saharan Africa

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:40.690
where any employment
creation happened.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.740
This is a disaster,
because we are

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.310
going to treble the labor
force in the next 35 years,

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:52.140
from $460 million people in
the labor force to 1.2 billion.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:57.510
On the back of a dynamic where
the African region is only 2.5%

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.930
of the global economy, so
it has no bargaining power

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:05.220
within the rules of the
game of how globalization

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.240
is impacting on the continent.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.590
So unsurprisingly, living in
formerly and living in slums

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:14.340
is a pre-dominant condition
for most urban dwellers

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:19.620
in sub-Saharan Africa,
with significant exceptions

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.440
being South Africa and
the North Africa region.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.740
So very briefly, if you
look at how people live,

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.130
if you look at how people
work, informality is

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.034
the predominant condition.

00:14:31.034 --> 00:14:33.450
What that means though, from
a planning and a policy point

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:37.140
of view, is that it translates
into a real fiscal problem,

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.120
because we've got a
very small tax base

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.100
as a result of this condition.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.200
So if you don't have
a revenue stream,

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.410
where do you amass
the resources to begin

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.620
to respond to the physical
manifestation of this?

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.870
And to give you just
a glimpse of what

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:55.110
this means in real terms, we
did, for another piece of work

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:58.890
we did, we tried to work up
what is the per capita spending

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:02.940
power of public authorities
in various African cities?

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.640
South Africa has a very
devolved fiscal system,

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.440
so you can see it's an
outlier in these comparisons.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.130
But the next city after
Johannesburg and Cape Town

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:16.810
is Addis Ababa, and it is
only $91 per capita per annum.

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:20.260
Right-- per annum-- and
you can see the comparative

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.420
to London or to
Seooul to give you

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.440
a sense of what the
order of magnitudes

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.400
are here in terms of how we
respond to these conditions.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.690
So in this kind of
context, of course,

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.010
master planning and
land-use control

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:36.850
take on a distortionary
role, because

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:39.880
of the predominance of informal
systems of livelihood, economy,

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:40.870
and settlement.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:44.950
And these plans tend to
be incapable of seeing

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:48.670
that in the way that Dilip
spoke about optics of perception

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:50.650
and what can be seen earlier.

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:52.960
Urban regulation is
comprised, of course,

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.440
of multiple systems of
control, rule, and mediation.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.830
And there is a very, very
dense and almost impenetrable

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:03.220
logic of coexistence,
symbiosis, and competition.

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.840
It is not kind of--

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.820
the word, the
notion of symbiosis

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:10.510
might purvey a certain
elegance, but it

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:14.260
is a rough business
of intense power

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.670
differentials and conflict.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:19.960
And it is pretty brutal
in a highly gendered way.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.720
This, of course, means
that in the larger context

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.660
of political and
governance reform,

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.780
there is this demand
on states to perform

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:32.650
the ritual of formal
systems of democratic rule,

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.630
whilst, of course,
the real mechanisms

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:36.860
of running the city, of
running neighborhoods,

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.860
is all about dealmaking.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.560
And that's really
beginning to understand

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.130
what those practices and
institutional manifestations

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:48.460
of routine dealmaking
is, that I would argue

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.620
is at the heart of what
this alternative reading

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:53.650
of planning's
potentialities might be.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:58.030
Now last year, we convened
everyone in Quito.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:01.720
And of course, everyone arrived,
and no one could get in.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:06.130
That's an inside joke for
people who attended the event.

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:07.960
The logistics wasn't
any where near

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.160
as efficient as Radcliffe's,
and as a result,

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.280
most people spent
half the day queuing

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.470
to get access to the event.

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:17.020
But this, of course, was
meant to be the moment where

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.950
we were going to confront the
real city as it is emerging

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:23.290
with all of its complexity
around the world

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:26.020
and begin to put forward
a proposition about how

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:26.980
to respond.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:30.440
The framework, unfortunately,
was kind of the same old,

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.660
same old.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.540
The developing story of
basic services and so forth

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.070
was seen to be the
ideal outcomes.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:40.180
The levers for change were
these institutional reforms

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:41.320
at the national level.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.210
Legislation was required.

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.280
And the means for
delivering this new vision

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.880
was all about territorial
planning and urban design.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.980
And that design question
I can come back to

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:51.970
in the discussion time.

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:57.310
But planning being elevated
as the critical intervention

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:02.350
point to deliver the urban
century, if you will.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:06.880
Now this wasn't particularly
helpful, because what it fails

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.710
to do is to confront this--

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:12.260
what I call the real city.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.500
But then, because
it fails to do that,

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:20.720
it still reduces these
emergent dynamics

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:25.040
in the city to simply being
an expression of dysfunction.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.780
And so, of course,
the remedy then

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.660
is political will, sustained
institutional reform,

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.300
credible fiscal policies, and
competent urban management,

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:32.800
right?

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.790
Who can argue with these things?

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:38.450
So to kind of maybe reflect
on the challenges of what

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.250
that might mean
in practice, allow

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:43.970
me to consider two
very quick examples.

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:49.280
So this is a beautiful public
art in performance in Accra.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.460
Unfortunately, I can't talk
about that, because as I said,

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:56.120
I'm rather on this end of
the spectrum this afternoon.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.620
So what we see across
most African cities

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:02.522
is this kind of deal
condition of public policy

00:19:02.522 --> 00:19:04.355
that takes on the form
of what I would argue

00:19:04.355 --> 00:19:07.280
is slum neglect as this
picture of [INAUDIBLE] shows,

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:12.200
in favor of an obsession with
these new enclave elite forms

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.810
of urbanism driven by
private real estate

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:19.310
capital and developers and
facilitated by public, very

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:22.230
scarce, public resources.

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:23.810
The International
New Town Institute

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:26.190
is mapping this phenomena
across the continent.

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.550
And this is kind of
the latest update

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:32.630
of the proliferation of these
ambitions and real plans.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:36.620
If we look at Accra, classic
example of the challenges

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:37.760
we face.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.980
This shows you the
dramatic expansion

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.830
in the footprint of the
city in just 25 years,

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:45.530
with very, very little
concomitant investment

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:47.970
in infrastructural capacity.

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:52.190
So in 1990, when you
saw the footprint

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:54.980
as the sort of deep
red area there,

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.820
the infrastructural
capacity was merely

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.990
for a third of the
population at that point.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:04.130
And there's been very little
additional expansion to keep up

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:06.770
with the land use encroachment.

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:11.450
So kind of a whole slew
of infrastructural crisis

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:12.210
is the norm.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:13.450
It's a permanent pattern.

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:15.410
Only a third of the
city's residents

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:18.290
have access to water
borne sanitation.

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:20.840
The three landfill waste
sites were closed down

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.840
in 2015 because of
political conflicts.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.430
And as a result,
the water system

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:28.700
got completely contaminated
because of the waste

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.580
systems having-- the waste
having no place to go.

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.350
And what has happened
in the last while

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:38.030
is a obsession with
delivering this--

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.490
[INAUDIBLE] habitat,
because it is

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.550
consistent with this vision
of anticipatory planning.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:46.519
You leave the meso city alone,
and you anticipate where

00:20:46.519 --> 00:20:47.810
all that growth is going to go.

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:51.550
And you try and get ready so
that you can, in fact, produce

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.000
this alternative urbanism.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.410
I don't have time to go into why
that is profoundly problematic,

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:00.530
but it is just to illustrate
that this is a phenomenon we

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.330
see across the continent.

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:04.220
Quickly, in South
Africa, we have

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.590
had one of the most ambitious
public housing programs

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:07.960
in the world outside of China.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.370
It's a similar model to
Chile and to Colombia

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:13.790
to some extent, free public
housing through 100% subsidy

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:17.390
that delivers this kind
of modernist stock.

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:19.460
In some ways celebrated,
very important,

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:22.460
an example in Cape Town
is an area called Dunoon.

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.640
The dwellings were
delivered in 2000,

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:31.880
and by 2012, that's what it
looked like in real terms.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.220
And what that reflected
was a settlement that

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:37.730
was designed to house
3,000 households,

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.970
15,000 people, in fact,
became a settlement

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:46.100
within a decade that was
housing 66,000 people through

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:50.720
in full development,
informal redefinition

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.430
of this modernist vision.

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:55.580
Now you can just kind of
extrapolate for yourself

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.179
all of the kind of urban
management planning

00:21:58.179 --> 00:21:58.720
and so forth.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.136
And this is in a
case where you've

00:22:00.136 --> 00:22:03.350
got a $12,000 per
capita country,

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:06.990
modern infrastructure, high
level of planning capacity,

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:08.550
et cetera, et
cetera, et cetera--

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:13.520
and we have no idea how to
respond to this real response

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.130
to these plans, so
to conclude them.

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:22.760
So firstly, I think we shouldn't
abandon the idea of planning.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.050
Obviously, it makes no sense.

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:30.050
But maybe we can reanimate or
recast what we mean by planning

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:33.710
and think of building a
different set of vocabularies

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:35.420
and practices, right?

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:40.430
So the spatial framework
idea remains critical.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:43.700
But I think it can
be redeployed to map

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.060
and read the real
city in its fullness,

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:52.010
formal and informal,
makeshift and organized

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:53.810
in terms of its economic,
social, cultural,

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:55.400
and ecological dynamics.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.520
And we see very few
examples of this kind

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:02.470
of spatial representation
pretty much, anyway.

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.640
Infrastructure is obviously key.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.350
But to think of
infrastructure, again--

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:10.340
and I was so struck by
Dilip's incredibly evocative,

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:13.590
real representation
of flows and patterns

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:15.270
that helps us to see
very differently.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:21.570
And it's kind of a really
exploded example of what

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:26.650
I had as a notion in my mind.

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:30.840
So it was really inspiring
to see that example, for me,

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.920
of what I would regard as this
kind of reading of landscape

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.920
and natural and social
and cultural forces.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.580
And very, very importantly, and
planners are hopeless at this,

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.490
is building maps
and representations

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:45.990
of institutional dynamics.

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:50.160
Because what you have are these
complex, modern, traditional

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.190
gangster, organized
crime, et cetera,

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:57.690
institutional contaminations
that run these places.

00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:00.700
And we have no way of reading
that or making sense of it.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:04.080
And how can we possibly
recalibrate regulation

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.360
if we don't have a language
or way of thinking about that.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.530
And finally, planning as
a platform for-- and again

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:13.140
in my work, I'd elaborate
this much further-- this idea

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.080
of Action Networks, which are
not formally institutions,

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.930
but a network of people
committed to a certain idea

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:20.610
of the adaptive city.

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:24.240
And in the last minute,
I'll conclude with what

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.590
this proposition adds up to.

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:29.080
And this is at the core of a
book that will come out later

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.920
in the year and further work
over the next few years.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.290
But really, I'm very
interested in the idea

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:36.090
of planning as narrative.

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:39.090
And if we can kind of
think of the adaptive city

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:42.900
as an alternative narrative
that allows us to think,

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.810
if you will, these
interdependent

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:50.040
dynamics in the same
breath, so to speak, so

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.400
that we don't have to be
totally skeptical of technology.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.220
We can absolutely see
the potential value

00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:00.840
of low tech, labor
intensive enablements that

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.990
can be imagined and
produced off the back

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:06.450
of new technological
possibilities.

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:08.400
But at the same
time, there's no way

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.430
that we insist that we
can accept the conceit

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:13.320
of the smart city idea--

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:16.350
that you've got to put
in the fiber backbone

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.500
40 kilometers away
from the real city

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.690
so that you can build this
new future utopia that we

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:24.600
saw some intimations
of this morning.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.180
So practically, it boils
down to this double move

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.850
that we think about localization
and regional transitions

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:31.170
at the same time.

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:33.300
And there is kind of
a font mistranslation

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.960
there, so it's kind of gone
all wobbly in the circles.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.940
And these regional
transitions is really about

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.950
the big catalytic
ones that allows

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:43.530
for building fundamentally
qualitatively

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:45.960
different urban dynamics
and forms and patterns

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:49.050
and flows and circulations,
energy mobility, ICT.

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:51.810
But more importantly
institutionally,

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:55.740
if that is done in a strategic,
intelligent, negotiated way,

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:58.260
one can begin to address
the fiscal question.

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:01.320
And in some ways
the most important,

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:04.560
urgent, politically vital
fiscal planning question

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:07.980
is a fiscal question, right?

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.710
And of course, none of this
is possible with some kind

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:14.359
of systematic way of learning
and experimenting and so forth.

00:26:14.359 --> 00:26:15.900
There's another part
of the argument,

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.620
which is about localization,
that I won't get into.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.390
And then just to conclude--

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:23.580
in this gesture of what
an alternative approach

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:28.410
to planning might mean, planning
becomes a narrative device

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:32.160
that can offer credible
account of the real city.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.200
Planning then has the
potential to function

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.050
as a deliberative framework,
within which coalitions

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:40.020
of practice are cohered
to design, test and adapt

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.060
alternative
infrastructure approaches,

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:44.610
service delivery models and
livelihood strategies that

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:47.790
can forge a new, adaptive
approach to place-making

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:49.440
and cityness.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.219
Thank you.

00:26:50.219 --> 00:27:00.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.400
- Good afternoon.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.640
I'm very thankful for the
Radcliffe Institute and Liz

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.820
and all her team
to having me here.

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:11.710
It's been a pleasure to hear
all these thoughts today.

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:14.610
And I'm almost the last
one, last but not least.

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:15.550
There's another one.

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:20.190
So please bear for
the next 15 minutes.

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:22.950
I've called my presentation
Intermediate Spaces.

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:26.040
And I will be talking
about housing.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.040
Because housing is probably
one of the biggest elements

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.550
that build up our
urban cities, and we

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:37.500
will see this in the
context of Medellin.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.870
Social housing in
Columbia is planned either

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:42.330
by the private developer
or the government

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:44.340
by building mass
produced housings

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:47.340
on sites outside of
the city or high rise

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.080
buildings in urban areas.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:52.650
And course, with no
understanding of context

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:55.860
or habits of the inhabitants.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.840
Most of the times,
housing solutions

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.250
seem to be concerned with
the problem of quantity

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:01.770
and not of quality.

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:04.810
So let me understand
what does this mean.

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:07.950
Well, this geometric
element called home,

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:10.950
it has an inside, where it
should embrace the diversity

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:12.390
of the human being.

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:15.240
And towards the outside, it
should preserve the identity

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:20.340
of the context, proposing new
textures, new places to live

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.690
by understanding three issues.

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:26.820
The first one, basically,
is landscape textures.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:30.270
And we live in a tropical
landscape where mountains are

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:34.920
huge, vegetation is dense,
water, rain is abundant,

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.500
and sun is strong,
Therefore, it is

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:42.660
important to live consequently
with our surroundings.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:46.020
The second idea is
how do we dwell?

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:49.020
Popular habits create
architectural elements.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.450
We need to understand the
different architectural

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:54.550
elements that identify
a particular community.

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:58.410
For example, in our Andean
[INAUDIBLE] mountains,

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:01.860
tropic landscape, life
happens between the inside

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:02.760
and the outside.

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:06.630
Somehow, somebody was
telling us this morning.

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:10.560
I mean, there's no barriers
of inside and outside.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.230
So this is an important
element in our daily life.

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:16.440
We have balconies,
terraces, stairways

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.100
where people interact.

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.100
And this is very important.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:23.010
And thus this creates
intermediate and collective

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:24.240
areas.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.760
So solving a housing problem
cannot be the creation

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.420
of an interior space
to accommodate people.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.970
What is important is to build
up a sequence of threshold

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:34.980
between the most
public space, which

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:40.170
is the streets, the plazas, and
the private space of our homes.

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:44.040
So the design of these different
housing units cannot be solved

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.900
by designing the unit itself.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:49.230
An additional area, which I
called intermediate space,

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:53.380
is an additional and inseparable
part of the solution.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.310
We find eaves of roofs,
corridors, balconies, terraces,

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:59.280
stairs, bridges and
aerial walkways.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.380
All of these spaces
contribute to the building

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.570
of sustainable
communities and become

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:05.490
the texture of our landscape.

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.410
In this brief
conversation, I aim

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:10.080
to explore ways in
which design can

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.900
influence housing
typologies, enabling

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.120
the unplanned to happen.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.550
These design issues
are capable of hosting

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:20.430
the rituals of collective
and individual life

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:24.810
experiences in housing schemes
in the city of Medellin

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:26.700
and the region of Antioquia.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.830
So we will see three cases.

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:31.170
Two of the cases in
the city of Medellin.

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:34.020
One in the periphery and the
borders and the outskirts,

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:36.690
one in downtown, and
the other in the region.

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:39.390
Because region is becoming
a very important issue

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:42.810
when we talk about
our territory.

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:46.470
And in the three cases, we
will see different timeline

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:49.530
regulations, different
actors, and of course,

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:53.010
how this unplanned
situation of inhabitants

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:55.830
take into understanding
this new place

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:58.800
and take an appropriation of it.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.080
So this is the city of Medellin.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.870
It is a city of 3 and
1/2 million inhabitants

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:06.350
where mountains are quite high.

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:09.810
They rise around 1,000 meters.

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:12.850
And we will see two
projects in this area.

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:15.960
The first one is Canaveral.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.840
This is a project
developed before the turn

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.740
of the century in 1998.

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.160
And it consists of 150 units.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.470
And it is in the
outskirts of the city,

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:30.210
because this is where
housing, social housing was

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:33.210
built due to the land value.

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:37.590
But the geography becomes
the main tool of design.

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:40.050
We have very steep slopes.

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:42.530
And it overlooks the
whole of the city.

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:49.200
So the question here when
we were designing was,

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.620
how can we design
the idea of a home

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.480
when we had to
develop three houses

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.420
in the same plot of land?

00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:01.470
So this was the answer
we wanted to look for.

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:04.350
So using the
topography as a tool,

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:07.890
we designed a plot
of land of six

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:11.940
by 12, which would contain
three independent houses.

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:17.040
But each house would have
an access from the walkway.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:21.270
So we would have a first
block, a first house, Number A,

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:25.320
accessing from the
lower block walkway.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:31.380
The second house entering from
the upper walkway, and then

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.340
the third one as well.

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:41.580
So this building of three houses
would build up the whole row

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:47.100
system of these streets,
which would run along

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:52.080
the contours of the geography,
allowing that each house would

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.240
have access from the street.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:58.020
So this is a concept of house
and not of an apartment.

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:00.780
So this was very important
when you understand

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:05.190
what people want when they
become to live together,

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:07.980
and especially to a
segment of middle class

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:11.730
or lower class in an area
which is up in the mountains,

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:12.900
up in the hills.

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:15.330
And when you understand that
these different elements,

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:20.220
stairways, patios, and
terraces become incorporated

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:23.610
as part of the
solution to propose

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:26.250
those intermediate
thresholds between the inside

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:29.670
and the outside and
that become areas

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:34.830
where people in the family
start to inhabit before they

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:36.220
come to the outside.

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:40.710
So these are the elements of the
process of planning, which try

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:44.020
to incorporate the unplanning.

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:47.040
The second project we're
going to see is in downtown.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.690
And this is important, because
there is a shift in regulation.

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:52.530
And it wants that
housing does not

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:55.620
be in the outskirts of
the city, but inside.

00:33:55.620 --> 00:34:03.690
And this is because the
government lowers taxes

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:06.360
for the constructors
so that they

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:09.480
can start to build in downtown.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.699
So this is the case of La Playa.

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:14.909
And it is in the downtown area.

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:19.219
This is a block of
80 by 80 meters.

00:34:19.219 --> 00:34:24.580
And we would have to
develop 254 units.

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:31.440
And when we got that question of
254 all living in this square,

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:34.650
we thought how do we
rethink the idea of density,

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:37.980
and how do we think rethink
the idea of flexibility--

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:41.350
where we want each person
to have their own apartment

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:44.760
and it had to be different,
so that this unplanning

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:47.320
process would start to happen?

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:50.010
So we designed,
firstly, by the units,

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:52.290
by the most intimate space.

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:55.230
So it is a definite element.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:59.430
Its a rectangular element
by five by 10.6 meters,

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:03.000
containing a battery of services
and a single [INAUDIBLE] space,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.970
with four identical windows
allowing natural light

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:08.910
and ventilation
for future rooms.

00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:10.980
The walls of the
unit are structural

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:13.530
and are the finished
appearance of the exterior

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:15.060
and the interior.

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:17.250
What we realized,
what was important,

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:20.940
was that we would give more
area, but less finished.

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:25.620
Because we know that investment
will happen in the inside,

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:27.190
and never in the outside.

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:29.430
So this was very
important in the shift

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:34.590
of planning that the design
decisions and perfect decisions

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:37.840
were in the outside, and not
in the inside of the home.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.380
So this allowed for
an initial investment

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:44.340
of an unfinished unit, allowing
the highest possible surface

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:48.270
of 52 square meters
plus a balcony, which

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:50.040
would be finished
according to the needs

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:55.420
of the economic possibilities
of the users, unplanned.

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:58.690
So how do we build
up this complex?

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:03.670
First, we have a basic unit.

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:05.800
Four units compose
the service core,

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:09.580
which has an opening, the main
one and a second one allowing

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:12.870
a crossing point
on the first floor.

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:17.550
Four service cores will
build up the first strip,

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:20.970
the second strip,
the third strip.

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:24.180
Then you have 12 independent
vertical circulations,

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:29.360
all going up with a system
of pedestrian walkways.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:33.440
And this, all together,
will build up 254 units,

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.720
but in 12 independent buildings.

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:38.090
And this was very
important as a concept,

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:41.750
because we could
have planned it up,

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:43.820
but we decided to
put it the other way.

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:47.690
And in the horizontal
system, we allowed

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:49.550
that four different
buildings would

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:55.710
appear instead of having one, or
three different ones going up.

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:57.540
So this was very important.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:01.610
So our bet was the outer
skin and the relationship

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:04.970
to the public real and
all invariable elements

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:07.370
as walkways, common
areas, stairways

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:10.580
will dignify the intimate
life of inhabitants.

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:14.260
This basic decision start to
transform the surrounding,

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.850
a new urban park with
the Museum of la Memoria

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:20.030
was developed later on by the
government in the open areas

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:21.140
just adjacent to it.

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:26.510
The opened walkways,
pedestrian walkways

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:28.940
are the extension of the
activities of the house.

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:31.490
A neighborhood seems to
arise, where children are

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:34.190
going to play in the outside.

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:36.542
And this photograph
really brings me

00:37:36.542 --> 00:37:38.000
the idea of
neighborhood, where you

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.620
see children and people looking
out, being part of the city.

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:44.690
And this is very
important for us.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:50.460
And finally, each unit
inside has a unique family.

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:52.144
Each one building
their own home,

00:37:52.144 --> 00:37:54.310
allowing for the unplanned
of the process to happen.

00:37:57.974 --> 00:38:03.550
And now we will go to
the state of Antioquia.

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:06.130
During the years
of 2012 and 2015,

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:08.440
I was consultant for
VIVA, [INAUDIBLE] Housing

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:11.920
Corporation, designing rural
and urban social housing

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.920
for the region under
a program which

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:20.050
is VIP, which means housing
for priority families, which

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:23.740
was 100% subsidized which
is a program of free housing

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.870
for people.

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:31.600
And this is a town of Salgar,
southwest of Medellin.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.930
And it is a very long
and narrow valley

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:38.260
with a creek in the middle
called the Liboriana.

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:42.100
And it has a [INAUDIBLE] region,
which has slopes going up

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:43.630
from both sides.

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:46.990
And two years ago, due to
heavy and continuous rains,

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:49.510
as we've been hearing
the last session,

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:52.670
we had a big overflow
of the Liboriana Creek,

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:57.820
affecting and destroying
384 homes and 17 bridges.

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:02.020
In response to this, there
was a reconstruction project

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:08.580
built between a partnership
of the public, the private,

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:13.340
and several foundations, as
well with all the community, all

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:16.780
the families to
build up their homes.

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:20.200
This process took two
years to take place.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.600
But what was very important
was the definition

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:27.640
of where along this very
narrow and long valley

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:30.070
to find the appropriate sites.

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:37.840
So two sites were
detected inside of Salgar.

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:41.770
And the third one, which
is this one to the left,

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:43.210
is in the rural area.

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:47.080
But I'll talk about the middle
one, which is La Habana.

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:53.980
The site had an
irregular geometry,

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:58.820
has a small plateau,
base of a steep mountain

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:02.530
on the upper side, and behind
a row of existing one level

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:07.860
houses, and then next to a
recently built sports facility.

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:09.910
It then descends
with a steep slope

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:13.150
towards the main road at
the bottom of the side

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:15.370
and to the creek
to the far right.

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:18.310
If the plan was to
build, then, 42 houses,

00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:20.650
the question we
asked ourselves again

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:24.940
was how can we give the
idea of entering a home

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:28.210
with this idea of a street?

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:34.030
And the second thing we
wanted to try to answer

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:38.800
was what was the appropriate
density for a place where

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.890
we had to reconnect
people who had a tragedy

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:43.900
and were coming to
a new neighborhood?

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:47.950
So this was kind of how
do we address this idea.

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:53.208
And to address this we
designed a project made--

00:40:53.208 --> 00:40:54.590
uh oh-- OK.

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:57.530
The one before, we saw
three strips of buildings.

00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:59.540
But each strip of
building was designed

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.830
by a unit called the Gallery.

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:06.050
So if the inside was developed
with the regulations that

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:10.580
were asked by government, we bet
on proposing a collective area

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:12.440
which is at the
outside, which was

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.170
a common pedestrian
street or a balcony

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:18.740
or a porch which would
allow this interaction

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:22.760
of the old neighborhood with
a new neighborhood to happen.

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:25.400
So planning would
happen with the families

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.710
to understand how
their belongings would

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:30.270
come into their homes.

00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:33.380
So that was planned,
that took place.

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:36.470
But what was important
was the outside,

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:41.240
because we gave this kind of
porch with a little bench.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:46.030
But by allowing this bench,
concrete bench to appear,

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:50.910
it allowed people to use the
space as they really wanted.

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:52.100
And identity happened.

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:53.860
So you see chairs.

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:56.690
You see vegetation.

00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:59.990
You see afternoon talk.

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:03.930
You see children playing,
or they are looking after,

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:09.900
like this was a huge crib,
people observing, looking down.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:12.570
And this is our bet.

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:16.770
I mean, we want to build
up communities where people

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:18.070
interact with the building.

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:21.510
So we plan to a certain point,
but then it is important

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:25.530
that the unplanned, but we
know it's part of the process,

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:26.910
takes place.

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:30.660
So these are the buildings
in the situation today,

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.990
looking down into the valley.

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:35.850
But we consider that
it is from the inside

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:38.700
that we have to
plan the context.

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:41.340
I mean, we work both
scales, but it is important

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:43.740
this relationship from
one side to the other.

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:53.580
So we have seen three cases of
planned social housing schemes

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:57.390
where design can influence
housing typologies enabling

00:42:57.390 --> 00:43:01.620
the unplanned to take
place by an appropriation

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:06.690
of the private space, or
beyond, with local identity

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:08.953
and with human experiences.

00:43:08.953 --> 00:43:09.939
Thank you.

00:43:09.939 --> 00:43:17.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:18.900
- It's Ricky.

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:20.100
- Ricky, welcome.

00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:23.810
- All right.

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:25.010
Good evening to everybody.

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:27.200
And I hope you can
hear me, and apologies

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:28.970
for not being with you.

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:29.780
Can you hear me?

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:35.700
- Can you hear us?

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:36.470
- Yes.

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.970
- Good.

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:39.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:39.940
- OK.

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:42.940
So what I want to
do in my time is

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:47.530
to respond to Eve's very
interesting introduction

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:51.640
about the status of
planning and also

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:56.977
pick up on some of the issues
that both Edgar and Ana

00:43:56.977 --> 00:43:58.060
Elvira have talked about--

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:02.650
Edgar focusing
importantly on the aspect

00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:07.180
of institutional dynamics
and Ana Elvira fundamentally

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:10.480
talking about
design and quality.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:14.950
And what I want to do is talk
about both of these aspects

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:18.880
and how planning should
and can, and Eve,

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:22.810
I want to be optimistic here,
actually bring both together.

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:27.970
And I want to do this through
the examples in London.

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:28.630
Next slide.

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:35.590
As Edgar has already
described, it's

00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:39.980
impossible to talk about
one aspect of planning.

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:43.990
It's also impossible to talk
about one aspect of a city.

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:48.280
My city, London, is a
city with an average GDP

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:51.400
of $50,000 a year.

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:56.140
And we saw from Edgar's
statistics, that $15,000 a year

00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:59.380
are invested in infrastructure.

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:04.080
It's a city which has 500 banks
and international headquarters.

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:09.140
But the next slide also shows
another aspect of London.

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:13.190
It's actually a low density,
nearly bucolic city.

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:16.340
But if you look very
carefully at the skyline which

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:19.580
is emerging from this
image, you can feel

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:23.240
the tensions of that growth.

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.210
And it's exactly
here that planning

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:29.000
can intervene in a useful way.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.470
Next.

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:37.200
But unlike sub-Saharan
Africa, and to a degree

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:43.800
unlike Medellin, London is an
old, creaky, difficult, mature

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.740
city.

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:48.620
And if you want
to absorb growth--

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:51.710
and let's remind
ourselves, those cities

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:55.340
which need and have
growth are lucky, as

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.200
opposed to the
opposite, of people

00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:01.220
leaving cities and leaving
because they have no jobs--

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:05.270
if we want to absorb growth
in a city like London,

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:09.350
we have to absorb
it within existing

00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:13.090
spaces like the one we
see represented here,

00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:14.000
or the next slide.

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:20.560
I want to talk in fact about
two projects which have filled

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.770
the gaps of these cities.

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:28.780
And in response to Eve's first
provocation about public sector

00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:31.930
and private sector, I
want to nearly conclude

00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:36.920
right at the beginning that
private development need not

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:41.120
be negative as long
as it is well-planned.

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:45.590
And public sector by
definition is not positive

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:47.510
unless it's well-planned.

00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:52.480
And this is where the adaptive
nature of planning is central.

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:54.230
And the two examples
I want to give

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:59.220
are the Olympic neighborhood
in the east of London,

00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:03.350
which is an ongoing
project 100% funded

00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:07.340
by the public sector to
the tune of $15 billion

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:10.560
over a long period of time.

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:14.860
And the next, a private
sector development,

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:17.520
100% private, which
is also ongoing

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:21.130
in a more central part of
London, which is being built

00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:23.980
by investors and pension funds.

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:27.640
Where Eve, just to respond
to your provocation,

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:34.390
I think actually, well-designed,
high quality public spaces

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:37.750
which are adaptable, whether
it's public or privately funded

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:40.780
can actually respond to
the needs of the city.

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:43.650
Next slide.

00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:46.860
If you look at this image
really quite carefully,

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:51.520
and you zoom in, I know it
may be a bit out of focus,

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:55.840
you see one of the most livable
cities in the global north.

00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:59.980
It's a part of London, north
London, which actually,

00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:03.700
from where you're sitting and
from where I'm sitting, looks

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:06.530
and is a mess.

00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:09.960
And I think the provocation
for all of us in this panel,

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.380
is how can you actually
design an infrastructure which

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:16.150
allows a degree of messiness?

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:20.190
Eve, you introduced, very
interestingly, the notion

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:23.890
of wiggle room at the beginning.

00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:26.530
I think we need to
understand, in our planning,

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:29.980
how to adapt and
allow for wiggle room.

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:34.930
And I think I concur with
Edgar that maybe the best

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:39.640
form of planning is not
to anticipate outcomes,

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:42.100
not to anticipate outcomes.

00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:44.020
And what we're
seeing in this image

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:46.030
is maybe something
about that, and I'll

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:48.050
conclude with that in a moment.

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:50.880
Next slide.

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:53.600
There are other
ways of planning.

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:56.300
This is the archetypal
way of planning

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:58.380
a city from the
19th century, which

00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:01.860
has served this city well.

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:06.200
Or there's another model, which
is depicted in the next slide,

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:10.100
of a part of Rome, a central
part of Rome, which to a degree

00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:13.790
had planning, but an enormous
amount of informal growth.

00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:17.940
We could call it that, extremely
beautiful informal growth,

00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:21.860
which has reacted and adapted
to the tissue which is there

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:25.010
with high level of
quality of public space.

00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:26.710
Next slide.

00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:30.580
London, in this
image, is organic.

00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:31.720
It's messy.

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:35.930
It's unplanned, and therefore,
it's also extremely fragile,

00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:37.900
maybe an issue we can
come back to at the end.

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:40.640
Next slide.

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:43.610
Politics, as Edgar has
told us, is fundamental.

00:49:43.610 --> 00:49:46.760
You just can't talk about
planning without understanding

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:49.130
the institutional dynamics.

00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:53.240
We happened to have invented,
over the last 16 years,

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:57.230
the concept of a directly
elected mayor in London.

00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:58.850
This has been instrumental.

00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:00.630
Next slide.

00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:03.900
The reality-- you can't
see what's on this slide--

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:07.170
is that's actually
how planning works.

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:10.170
There are many different bodies,
many different institutions.

00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:11.650
And Edgar is absolutely right.

00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:13.950
We need to understand
those first, whose

00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:15.750
voice is being understood?

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:17.460
But you need a
framework to do that.

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:17.985
Next slide.

00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:23.130
London happens to be growing.

00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:25.350
It's now just
about nine million,

00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:27.600
and it will be 10
million by 2030.

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:30.310
Next slide.

00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:34.330
But there is a policy in place
which says that London cannot

00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:37.340
grow outside its boundary.

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:39.310
That's a very
strong planning act

00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:43.390
from the 1940s, which has
imposed a limit, and therefore

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:48.160
reduced sprawl, I think one
of the most intelligent forms

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:50.110
of planning that I know.

00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:53.590
So where do you grow when you
have the need to accommodate

00:50:53.590 --> 00:50:55.030
one more million people?

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:57.120
Next slide.

00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:01.560
Well, you find the gashes,
the open spaces that you have.

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:03.380
Next slide.

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:08.270
And this has meant that London
is slowly but firmly moving

00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:12.260
east, where many of the
ex-industrial spaces are.

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:14.410
Next.

00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:17.810
And the London plan, we did
not go into this in detail,

00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:21.010
focuses on these two things.

00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:23.110
Keep the city within its limits.

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:27.910
You need a powerful political
structure to do that.

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:32.230
But allow and encourage
development along the areas

00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:33.840
that you need to--

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:40.060
next-- particularly in areas
which have available land,

00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:43.600
like the two examples I'm going
to talk about in the next part

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.950
of my talk-- next--

00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:49.760
the King's Cross development
and the Olympic quarter, both

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:54.390
located in slightly central
but peripheral areas of London.

00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:56.440
Next.

00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:58.870
To understand London,
and this is responding

00:51:58.870 --> 00:52:03.760
to Edgar's request,
in a good way,

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:07.130
you need to understand
what the real city is.

00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:10.160
This map shows in red where
the people who are most

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:15.710
deprived in our city, in this
decade of the 21st century,

00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:16.820
are.

00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:19.490
And then green
are most affluent.

00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:23.900
You can see a split between east
and west and between periphery

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:25.720
and center.

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:28.720
Summarizing it very
quickly, it is the east

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.520
that is the most deprived.

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:34.060
If you did this map in
Paris and perhaps in Boston,

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:36.550
you would have a completely
different diagram.

00:52:36.550 --> 00:52:38.590
You need to understand
the structure

00:52:38.590 --> 00:52:43.000
within you're working before you
employ mechanisms to solve it.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.200
Next.

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:48.290
So our two areas are actually
in some of the most deprived

00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:49.580
parts of the city.

00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:52.340
Next.

00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:57.860
When London, by mistake, won the
Olympics for the 2012 event--

00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:01.840
if you remember, New York
was the strongest candidate--

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:05.170
the first decision that was
made, let's put it in an area

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:08.620
where we can do good
things with the $15 billion

00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:11.030
of public money.

00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:14.720
And let's try and not
make it into a ghetto,

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:17.930
but make it into an
integrated piece of city.

00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:21.440
This is exactly what Ana
Elvira has been talking about.

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:25.250
How do you, at the scale,
in her case of housing,

00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:28.940
create streets and connections,
so that as the city grows up

00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:31.250
around it or as you
integrate it with it,

00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:35.090
it does not stand alone
as an isolated ghetto?

00:53:35.090 --> 00:53:37.430
Eve, this is the planning
you've been talking

00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:39.230
about which is negative.

00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:41.810
The one that actually
creates what is on the left

00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:43.670
and not what is on the right.

00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:46.250
Next.

00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:48.470
What happened in the
site of the Olympics,

00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:51.040
you can see it there
circled in green,

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:55.310
is to take a site which was a
railway, disused railway land,

00:53:55.310 --> 00:53:58.070
surrounded by strong
sense of community,

00:53:58.070 --> 00:54:00.440
but literally cut off
from its surroundings.

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:02.416
Next.

00:54:02.416 --> 00:54:03.540
That's what it looked like.

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.600
Next.

00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:08.420
And that's where my fridge
and everyone else's fridge

00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:11.060
in London was dumped
for many, many years.

00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:13.080
Cities have back spaces.

00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.970
How do you foreground
them is the issue.

00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:16.930
Next.

00:54:16.930 --> 00:54:19.870
It's a place surrounded by
strong migrant communities

00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:21.520
from different
parts of the world

00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:23.950
and different
ethnicities, very rich.

00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:26.070
Next.

00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:29.160
And there was a desire
by the government

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:35.400
to use this policy to try and
effectively redistribute wealth

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:37.350
through long term planning.

00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:39.000
And time is essential to this.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.220
Next.

00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:42.630
So this was the vision.

00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:45.080
These are the visions
that we all hate.

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:48.260
It's an image of a sort
of perfect seamless

00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:50.499
community fixed in time.

00:54:50.499 --> 00:54:52.040
What I want to say
in the few minutes

00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:54.620
that I talk about this
and the next project,

00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:56.540
is how can you try
and actually work

00:54:56.540 --> 00:55:01.580
against the grain of fixity of
the image that you see here?

00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:03.350
Next slide.

00:55:03.350 --> 00:55:07.220
Well, this is an image of fridge
mountain during the Olympics

00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:10.460
itself, a nice park with
a stadium behind it.

00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:12.500
Next.

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:14.330
But you'll also
remember the slide

00:55:14.330 --> 00:55:16.610
that I showed you that
the site was totally

00:55:16.610 --> 00:55:18.560
isolated from its surrounding.

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:20.930
It was a railway goods yard.

00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:26.030
So the first chunk, in fact,
roughly a billion dollars

00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:29.840
of the money from
central government

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:35.420
was used to create 37
bridges, links, connections

00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:39.410
between this empty hole
and the rest of the city.

00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:40.970
In other words,
it's the beginning

00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:43.830
of that adaptive process that
we've been talking about.

00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:46.350
Next.

00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:49.910
The design I don't need to
go into in great detail.

00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:53.180
The most important thing about
this slide is that I hope,

00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:55.940
and it's not because it's
out of focus, but because

00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:59.930
of design intent, you
can't see the edges

00:55:59.930 --> 00:56:04.470
of where the site begins or
the Olympic site and the rest.

00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:07.430
It sort of looks like
the rest of messy London.

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:09.680
Next.

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:13.470
And significantly,
the way in which

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:17.490
the planning was conceived was
not to do it all in one go,

00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:20.790
because that is unrealistic,
not to start at one end

00:56:20.790 --> 00:56:23.550
and go down to the
bottom, not to start

00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:26.280
where the value is near
the railway stations

00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:27.820
and then build out.

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:31.530
But to actually do it in a
piecemeal way, which reflects,

00:56:31.530 --> 00:56:33.870
again, the reality,
as Edgar called it,

00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:35.730
of the processes of city change.

00:56:35.730 --> 00:56:38.220
Next.

00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:40.230
This is how many
parts of London have

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:42.000
grown for the last 200 years.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.340
Next.

00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:47.240
This is what the athletes'
village was like.

00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:49.500
Sorry, this is what was
the athletes' village

00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:52.950
and the picture taken
yesterday in what

00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:57.370
is part of the residential
community, which is roughly 50%

00:56:57.370 --> 00:57:01.500
affordable and 50% market
rental, known as the East

00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:02.190
Village.

00:57:02.190 --> 00:57:04.810
Next.

00:57:04.810 --> 00:57:05.620
There are schools.

00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:07.630
There are institutions
at the heart of it

00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:10.240
which serve not just the
new residents, but those

00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:11.270
in the surroundings.

00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:13.620
Next.

00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:19.470
There are 6,000 jobs created in
what used to be the [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:20.970
great media hall.

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:23.160
Next.

00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:26.640
Even the great swimming pool
designed by the late great Zaha

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:32.380
Hadid, next, which
was symbolic and had

00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:35.500
17,000 seats during the games--

00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:38.954
next-- is now where,
for $5, anyone

00:57:38.954 --> 00:57:40.870
who lives in the
neighborhood can actually use

00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:43.360
as a literally community pool.

00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:45.360
Next.

00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:48.570
The notion of actually creating
a park at the middle of it

00:57:48.570 --> 00:57:50.700
has actually become
a resource, not just

00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:53.190
for those who live there,
because you don't know

00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:55.770
where the edge is, but for
the much wider surrounding

00:57:55.770 --> 00:57:56.310
community.

00:57:56.310 --> 00:57:58.670
Next.

00:57:58.670 --> 00:58:00.170
But things change.

00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:01.770
And Eve has raised this.

00:58:01.770 --> 00:58:05.630
The ability to adapt,
to be resilient

00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:07.860
is absolutely central.

00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:13.380
What you see here is the
canal on the right-hand side,

00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:17.580
the swimming complex, and
then a sort of large park

00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:20.340
area with water on both sides.

00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:23.970
No one really knew what
to do with this area.

00:58:23.970 --> 00:58:26.400
And actually what has happened
over the last three or four

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:30.270
years, is that as the area,
the whole area of Stratford,

00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:33.840
has become more central
in the mind of Londoners

00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:37.650
and investors, next, a whole
series of organizations

00:58:37.650 --> 00:58:40.500
who would have never
touched this part of London,

00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:43.490
because of its distance
and its deprivation--

00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:47.550
the Victorian Albert Museum,
the University of the Arts,

00:58:47.550 --> 00:58:50.850
University College London, and
in fact, even the Smithsonian--

00:58:50.850 --> 00:58:54.990
next, are now actually
building new premises

00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:59.220
which will be part of a new
cultural quarter in a part

00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:01.750
of London that had no culture.

00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:03.370
Next.

00:59:03.370 --> 00:59:06.280
The most important
point I'm making here

00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:09.940
is that not
everything that we see

00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:13.240
happening in this part
of London was actually

00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:15.370
planned or understood.

00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:18.250
This is why I would
repeat and endorse

00:59:18.250 --> 00:59:21.190
the notion of not
anticipating outcomes,

00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:25.220
but to just provide a framework
which can adapt to them.

00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:26.670
Next.

00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:29.610
Let's look, very briefly,
in the last four minutes

00:59:29.610 --> 00:59:34.020
of my talk at the opposite
end of the scale in terms

00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:35.270
of investment.

00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:38.220
But perhaps similar
conclusions as to what

00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:42.600
might work or not work in
providing this wiggle room,

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:44.970
in dealing with a
fragile urban fabric,

00:59:44.970 --> 00:59:47.220
particularly in
areas of deprivation.

00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:48.830
Next.

00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:51.770
In an area which has two of
the best connected railway

00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:53.960
stations, certainly
in England, if not

00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:56.270
in Europe, King's
Cross on the right

00:59:56.270 --> 01:00:00.110
and St. Pancras on the
left, is another gash,

01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:02.570
another gaping hole
of railway goods yard.

01:00:02.570 --> 01:00:06.200
Think of Hudson Yards in
New York as the equivalent.

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.900
And keep that image of
Hudson Yards in your mind

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:12.680
for a moment, all of you who
know what is being built there.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:17.150
This was an image
only in the year 2000.

01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:18.880
Next.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.430
This is an image of what's
actually going to be built,

01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:24.490
and much of it is actually
more or less realized,

01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:27.970
with homes, jobs, and
other facilities which

01:00:27.970 --> 01:00:28.990
I'm going to talk about.

01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:30.670
Next.

01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:32.590
It's a project
which has benefited

01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:36.490
from massive public transport
investment, that is true.

01:00:36.490 --> 01:00:38.500
But the 4 billion
dollars comes from

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:43.510
Australian and Canadian pension
funds behind a front line

01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:44.680
developer.

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:49.150
I think we need to reflect how
those sorts of actors, as you

01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:51.880
called it, Eve, can
actually benefit

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:54.700
the structure of the city
rather than necessarily create

01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:55.870
yet another ghetto.

01:00:55.870 --> 01:00:57.780
Next.

01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:00.510
The way this part of
London was planned

01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:05.880
was to pick up the fine mix that
you see in surrounding areas.

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.320
Next.

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:11.140
The idea was, yes, it's private.

01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:15.100
But make it as connected
and as public as possible.

01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:17.110
Work on the streets
and the integration

01:01:17.110 --> 01:01:18.640
that we've heard of before.

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:20.230
Next.

01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:23.230
Three diagrams to show
you what was important--

01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:26.880
take every possible connection,
every possible street

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:29.620
that comes into the
site, and extend it

01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:30.940
into the neighborhood.

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:32.800
That's a very strong
starting point

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.750
for creating a
flexible framework.

01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:37.200
Next.

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.660
Put on the ground
floor the mix of

01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:41.560
uses that you find
elsewhere in London,

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:44.372
and don't just concentrate
them at the valuable end.

01:01:44.372 --> 01:01:46.080
What you see here in
the different colors

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.600
are everything from
museum, housing,

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:50.970
to places for work,
which were not expected

01:01:50.970 --> 01:01:52.860
in this part of London.

01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:54.890
Next.

01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:58.800
And the public
space, which you see

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.870
colored in brown
effectively here,

01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:02.760
is the one cohesive
element which

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.860
was fixed a few years ago.

01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:07.380
The uses of most of
the building have come

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:11.220
in as the project has evolved.

01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:13.570
Next.

01:02:13.570 --> 01:02:15.700
Public space is
one example here.

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:17.620
The buildings around
them, some are

01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:19.870
very good, some
are mediocre, seem

01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:22.450
to work well for the grain
of this part of London.

01:02:22.450 --> 01:02:24.250
Next.

01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:27.010
But most importantly,
no one knew

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:29.770
what to do with that fantastic
building in the background

01:02:29.770 --> 01:02:32.320
called the Granary Building.

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:37.130
And the University of the
Arts, next, moved into there,

01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:38.870
bringing-- next--

01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:41.960
5,000 students,
creative arts students,

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:44.450
who make things, who are
there until three or four

01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:48.380
or five o'clock in the morning,
moved in as the first tenants,

01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:50.660
with I'm sure, some
very, very good deal

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:54.210
when it came to the rent.

01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:57.210
But the point is that there
was a flexible enough structure

01:02:57.210 --> 01:02:58.170
to allow that.

01:02:58.170 --> 01:03:00.545
Next.

01:03:00.545 --> 01:03:02.110
Next.

01:03:02.110 --> 01:03:05.890
As a result of that, Google
decided to move all--

01:03:05.890 --> 01:03:10.120
all its European headquarters
into the site right next door.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.920
You could say
inspired by the fact

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:14.320
that there are students
and creative types

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:17.560
in the neighborhood, bringing,
in the next few years,

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.990
8,000 employees to this
area that you really

01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:22.960
wouldn't have thought
would have attracted them.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:25.270
The design that you see
there is now being changed,

01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:30.160
next, a little
bit, unfortunately,

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:34.579
inspired by Californian
notions of campus architecture.

01:03:34.579 --> 01:03:37.120
We're going to see what it looks
like in the next few months.

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.380
Next.

01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:41.440
But interestingly,
this has also meant

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:44.980
that Europe's largest medical
research facility has suddenly

01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:48.840
found its location there
next to the British Library.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:51.010
Next.

01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:55.480
Basically, I want to conclude by
saying that this project, which

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:58.810
didn't have a name except
that it was a development,

01:03:58.810 --> 01:04:01.300
is now seen as London's
knowledge quarter.

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:03.510
I know it's another brand.

01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:04.870
It's another name.

01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:06.715
But behind that,
as I said, there

01:04:06.715 --> 01:04:10.810
are 13,000 homes, of
which 50% are affordable,

01:04:10.810 --> 01:04:13.120
right in the middle
of London, where

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.920
there is better access
to jobs than you

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.240
could have anywhere else.

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:19.060
Next.

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:23.020
I showed you this image right
at the beginning, of Camden.

01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:25.930
It's a city which
has not been designed

01:04:25.930 --> 01:04:29.860
top down like Barcelona,
perhaps not even

01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:31.210
like the Manhattan grid.

01:04:31.210 --> 01:04:33.010
But it has similar
characteristics

01:04:33.010 --> 01:04:35.170
of adaptability.

01:04:35.170 --> 01:04:37.410
The point is, and this is
where I want to conclude,

01:04:37.410 --> 01:04:43.180
Eve, is that these adaptions
can be very fragile.

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:45.960
You can take exactly the sort
of sites I've been talking about

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.910
and turn them into fortresses.

01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:50.490
That's what's happening to
most of the new developments

01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:51.960
in the African city.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:54.990
That's what Edgar has
actually described to us.

01:04:54.990 --> 01:05:00.300
And that's why there's such a
strong anti-planning approach

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:02.309
in many of the words
and many of the concepts

01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:03.600
that you've been talking about.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.950
Next.

01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:08.640
I would argue-- next, please--

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:12.180
I would argue that in the end,
this planning model of London

01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:17.550
has one, at least allows us to
accept that cities are fragile.

01:05:17.550 --> 01:05:20.430
But that you can be
agile within that

01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:24.150
and provide a sort of resilient
framework, whereby planning

01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:26.580
returns in the 21st
century as something which

01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:34.080
is positive and applies not just
to the unique and rich cultures

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.900
that we happen to belong
to in the global north,

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:40.470
but can be applied and
adapted as we saw in Medellin,

01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:42.570
and I think need to
happen in Africa,

01:05:42.570 --> 01:05:46.447
but we're a very, very
long way away from that.

01:05:46.447 --> 01:05:47.280
Thank you very much.

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:56.438
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:56.438 --> 01:05:57.620
- Thank you, Ricky.

01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.460
Can you hear me?

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:03.040
- I can hear you, and I
think, I might even see you,

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.740
or you might even
see me, I don't know.

01:06:09.222 --> 01:06:09.722
- Hi.

01:06:13.658 --> 01:06:15.890
This was wonderful.

01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:20.210
Three really fascinating
presentations.

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:25.610
And each one actually very
different in terms of context

01:06:25.610 --> 01:06:31.700
obviously, also in terms of
scales and in terms of actors.

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:33.920
And yet there are
common themes that

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:38.240
run through them that I would
like to pick up and talk about.

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:43.550
Edgar, I think just in terms of
taking the scaler issue here,

01:06:43.550 --> 01:06:45.830
that you're looking--

01:06:45.830 --> 01:06:51.170
what we're getting here is
the systemic scale and sort

01:06:51.170 --> 01:06:56.450
of what the larger
systems that actually

01:06:56.450 --> 01:07:00.170
structure society, that
include structuring

01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:02.880
the urban environment.

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:05.390
And I think that one other
thing I wanted to say in here

01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:09.830
is that there also seems
to be one other theme that

01:07:09.830 --> 01:07:12.770
is emerging in all
of these three--

01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:15.170
or emerged in all of
these three talks,

01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:20.460
and that is what we can learn
from the informal, actually,

01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:22.250
and how we can learn from it.

01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:25.340
And one of the things I thought
that was very interesting

01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:32.060
about Edgar's presentation
was that, as he put it,

01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:35.990
the informal and the unplanned
processes and practices

01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:40.960
are constitutive in
both senses of the word,

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.800
in meaning that
they're composed of

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:46.940
and they also have the power
to give organized existence

01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:50.300
to something, that they
are in constitutive

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:56.570
of human settlements, but also
of broader economic activity.

01:07:56.570 --> 01:07:58.910
And that that is,
as I understand

01:07:58.910 --> 01:08:01.550
it, a very important
thing if one

01:08:01.550 --> 01:08:04.970
is going to think about
intervening in the city,

01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:09.890
that it is an environment
that incorporates place making

01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:11.570
and work.

01:08:11.570 --> 01:08:17.899
And that the planning
potential of informal practices

01:08:17.899 --> 01:08:20.569
is this creation of employment.

01:08:20.569 --> 01:08:24.649
And the issue, it seems to me
that you were talking about,

01:08:24.649 --> 01:08:26.479
is the scaling up.

01:08:26.479 --> 01:08:30.979
How does one scale that up
from this sort of small scale

01:08:30.979 --> 01:08:35.689
interventions to
institutionalize

01:08:35.689 --> 01:08:38.180
these processes and
these relationships

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:40.960
while still retaining
their flexibility.

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:45.830
And Ana, the scale of your
project was much smaller,

01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:47.899
and actually-- but
what's so interesting

01:08:47.899 --> 01:08:51.200
about it is that the
same issues pertain

01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:53.270
at these different
scalar levels.

01:08:53.270 --> 01:08:57.410
So this is about social housing
in the city and the region,

01:08:57.410 --> 01:09:03.770
public and private projects
that open up a relationship

01:09:03.770 --> 01:09:05.600
or that have an
open relationship

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.850
between the planned
and the unplanned,

01:09:07.850 --> 01:09:11.479
and particularly, you identified
interstitial spaces, these sort

01:09:11.479 --> 01:09:14.240
of mediating
spaces, thresholds I

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:19.430
think you called them, where the
public and the private overlap.

01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:26.029
That provide spaces of
opportunity, that these are,

01:09:26.029 --> 01:09:28.250
and if we're thinking
now in planning terms--

01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:31.720
that planning is about the
public and the private--

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:36.050
that it's these spaces
where these things become

01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:39.890
blurred that some
form of communal space

01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:41.660
has the potential to develop.

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:49.340
And Ricky, fascinating projects,
publicly and privately funded.

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:52.040
I think that your model
of fragility, agility,

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:56.720
and resilience is
something that applies

01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:58.860
to all of these projects.

01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:03.220
And I think that
one of the things

01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:06.310
that I found interesting
in some of the terminology

01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:09.720
that you used, that
flexible spatial frameworks,

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:13.630
and I think you used
that term, allows

01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:17.680
them to be shaped and
adapted and reappropriated

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:20.860
through relatively
informal processes.

01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:26.440
And so what's happening here
is that formal and informal

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:28.360
are becoming very relative.

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:30.460
And so that the
boundaries between them

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:34.120
are actually very fluid.

01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:38.290
And I think that there's also
a common vocabulary here,

01:10:38.290 --> 01:10:42.100
that the techniques and
processes are of appropriation.

01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:44.530
These are words that
everybody used, I think--

01:10:44.530 --> 01:10:50.740
adaptation, flexibility,
agility, resilience, hybridity.

01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:52.665
And there are a couple
of things that I

01:10:52.665 --> 01:10:54.040
think are interesting
out of that

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:57.220
that I'd like to pose as
a question or something

01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:58.670
to talk about here.

01:10:58.670 --> 01:11:00.670
And that is this--

01:11:00.670 --> 01:11:02.410
fundamentally, what
we've been looking at

01:11:02.410 --> 01:11:05.290
is this relationship between
the planned and the unplanned.

01:11:05.290 --> 01:11:07.690
And while these
informal processes

01:11:07.690 --> 01:11:10.750
have tremendous
potential, everyone

01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:13.690
has mentioned the
importance of having a plan,

01:11:13.690 --> 01:11:15.200
that you need to have a plan.

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:16.900
You need to have a
plan in the sense

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:20.220
that you need to have a concept
of what you're trying to do,

01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:22.910
of what your objective is.

01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:28.900
And there has to be some
kind of agenda there.

01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:34.090
And so I wanted to throw
that out and see if you

01:11:34.090 --> 01:11:35.994
wanted to comment on that.

01:11:35.994 --> 01:11:37.882
- You want to start?

01:11:37.882 --> 01:11:40.250
- You can start.

01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:43.900
- Well, Eve, I think it's
important to understand, well,

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:48.860
as I see it, that plan, the
concept of having a plan,

01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:54.700
is also a concept of defining a
physical definition of a space.

01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:57.110
And that's how I understand it.

01:11:57.110 --> 01:12:00.550
And the unplanned for
me is the people who

01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:03.170
come inside and interaction.

01:12:03.170 --> 01:12:07.030
So that's how I understand
planned and unplanned.

01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:09.280
Because you have a
definition of how do

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:14.870
you want uses, spaces,
whatever you want to call it.

01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:17.650
But it is important to
understand that people come in.

01:12:17.650 --> 01:12:21.310
And it is the interaction
of that planned idea,

01:12:21.310 --> 01:12:25.780
how people are able to
develop their rituals,

01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:27.130
their understanding.

01:12:27.130 --> 01:12:30.550
And as Richard or
Ricky was saying,

01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:33.520
it allows that this
framework of the planned

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:36.670
has to allow this
unplanned of the social.

01:12:36.670 --> 01:12:40.730
So I understand it as a
hardware and a software.

01:12:40.730 --> 01:12:43.030
And they do have to come
together all the time.

01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:48.400
You cannot think of them as
separate elements definitely.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.170
I don't know if that helps.

01:12:51.170 --> 01:12:53.320
- So slightly, yeah--

01:12:57.390 --> 01:13:00.790
so I guess the
idea of the plan--

01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:04.827
and as I suggested, to connect
it to the notion of narrative,

01:13:04.827 --> 01:13:06.910
and maybe that also will
see a useful connect back

01:13:06.910 --> 01:13:08.830
to the broader
thematic of why it

01:13:08.830 --> 01:13:10.390
is helpful to have
the humanities

01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:13.690
and the social sciences talk--

01:13:13.690 --> 01:13:18.010
is that, of course, the plan
goes to the heart of knowledge

01:13:18.010 --> 01:13:20.110
and control, right?

01:13:20.110 --> 01:13:23.860
And so in a lot of the
context that I'm interested in

01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:27.550
and that I work on,
it is the absence

01:13:27.550 --> 01:13:30.220
of the circulation of
knowledge or the deployment

01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:32.140
of certain kinds
of knowledges that

01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:38.830
allows a very, very small
elite to extract rents and make

01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:44.740
crazy profits and
essentially render

01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:48.100
the very same plan redundant.

01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:50.909
So there's a
politics of knowledge

01:13:50.909 --> 01:13:52.200
that I think is very important.

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:55.690
So I'm very attracted to the
idea of the plan in that it

01:13:55.690 --> 01:14:00.820
allows us to bring transparency
to a set of processes

01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:04.020
that unfold that structures
the deployment of capital.

01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:06.910
And I mean capital
in the broad sense,

01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:09.100
both the meager
savings of the street

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:15.700
trader and the
strategic opportunity

01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:19.300
that the pension
fund has spotted

01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:22.400
in whatever new development
is taking place.

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:25.900
And so I think that
it is important,

01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:29.210
if we continue to invoke
the idea of the plan,

01:14:29.210 --> 01:14:34.480
that it provides a rationale and
a democratic discipline for it

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.460
to effect transparency,
which then

01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:40.120
enables a different kind of
conversation to take place.

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:43.810
Secondly, because
of precisely the way

01:14:43.810 --> 01:14:47.860
in which the city is built and
reproduced by the sheer effort

01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:53.536
and sweat and aspirations
of its inhabitants,

01:14:53.536 --> 01:14:54.910
there's an
opportunity for people

01:14:54.910 --> 01:14:56.330
to tell their own stories.

01:14:56.330 --> 01:15:00.700
I was really drawn to
the beautiful drawings

01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:03.760
that you reflected of how people
imagined they could inhabit

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:08.920
these spaces as a part of
the process of imagining

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:12.340
how the design could get
that calibration right--

01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:14.830
between the
structuring framework

01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:19.990
and leaving enough space for a
culturally infused inhabitation

01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:22.580
to make home and to make place.

01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:25.050
So I think that
this idea that there

01:15:25.050 --> 01:15:28.520
are a multiplicity of
registers within which we plan,

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:31.600
in which we build narrative,
and in which we can, indeed,

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:36.130
contest certain god
given narratives of how

01:15:36.130 --> 01:15:38.860
the city should be built,
or where investments should

01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:42.250
go first, is as
urgent politically

01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:44.650
and economically as
it could ever be.

01:15:44.650 --> 01:15:46.240
And just the last
point I want to make

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:49.780
is that one of the things
that I struggle with

01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:54.070
is this really difficult,
often unintended,

01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:58.990
confluence of interest
between the need for obscurity

01:15:58.990 --> 01:16:01.390
on the side of the
dealmakers, the big deal

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:05.370
makers, and the
effect of a really

01:16:05.370 --> 01:16:10.030
staid, top down, inwardly
looking bureaucratic mentality

01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:14.470
that treats the plan
as an artifact that

01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:21.744
is the only guarantor of
public autonomy or authority.

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:23.410
Even though it doesn't
get implemented--

01:16:23.410 --> 01:16:26.290
but the amount of effort
bureaucratic planners

01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:28.390
spend in many African
local authorities

01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:30.550
and so forth to
perfect the plan--

01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:32.570
they know it's not
going to be used.

01:16:32.570 --> 01:16:36.310
But it's kind of the only
vestige of an attachment

01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:38.890
to authority that they have--

01:16:38.890 --> 01:16:42.310
serves the dealmakers
very, very well, right?

01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:44.510
And so there's also
a need, I think,

01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:47.950
to kind of radicalize
the idea of the plan,

01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:53.170
so that we can render strange
these incredibly dysfunctional

01:16:53.170 --> 01:16:54.004
practices.

01:16:54.004 --> 01:16:54.920
I don't know if that--

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:57.520
- But I think,
Edgar, that can only

01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:02.410
happen if the actors involved
in shaping those plans,

01:17:02.410 --> 01:17:07.570
in commissioning those plans,
in designing those plans,

01:17:07.570 --> 01:17:13.840
have in their mind set a
sort of interdisciplinarity

01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:16.390
already in their head.

01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:19.210
What I'm getting
at is most planning

01:17:19.210 --> 01:17:23.680
is in the hands of
professions which value

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:27.950
technique over social value.

01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:30.050
And I guess I am
getting at engineers,

01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:37.130
planners, who work in silos,
do not attend conferences

01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:39.980
like this one, and
where you don't

01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:44.480
get architects and engineers
talking to policy makers

01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:49.520
and sociologists, shall we say.

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:51.020
I think this is an
important point,

01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:55.170
because many plans, and
particularly in African

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:59.550
cities, are predicated on things
like we must improve access

01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:05.010
to mobility or
transport, full stop.

01:18:05.010 --> 01:18:09.420
It's a virtue and
an end in itself.

01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:14.360
If you look at the London plan
that I showed you very briefly,

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:16.290
and if you remember
the inequality,

01:18:16.290 --> 01:18:18.960
the deprivation
map, the London plan

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:23.140
can be summarized
in one sentence--

01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:27.460
To take the red areas,
the deprived areas,

01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:31.150
and redistribute them
across the city and not

01:18:31.150 --> 01:18:33.250
have an area of concentration.

01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:40.090
Therefore all the technical
investments, transport,

01:18:40.090 --> 01:18:44.620
broadband, better schools,
universities, education,

01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:47.320
are deployed as part
of that project.

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.970
And I think that
that is something

01:18:48.970 --> 01:18:52.150
that would be interesting
to perhaps speculate on,

01:18:52.150 --> 01:18:56.320
whether that's
possible outside--

01:18:56.320 --> 01:19:02.080
let's call it some mature,
elite government, examples

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:04.340
like the ones I've
been talking about.

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:08.620
But then I want to throw in
perhaps a slight critique

01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:16.870
of democratic processes
that we have inherited.

01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:21.070
The UK has had a planning
process for the last 100

01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:22.820
plus years.

01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:24.680
The result of that
is that the voice

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:28.970
of people living at the borough
level, the local authority

01:19:28.970 --> 01:19:34.130
level, is dominant when it comes
to giving planning permission.

01:19:34.130 --> 01:19:37.550
It's not community voiced,
but it's slightly above that.

01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:42.020
It's at the unit of
two, 300,000 people.

01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:45.320
Both the Olympic site
and the King's Cross site

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:49.180
cut across different
political boundaries.

01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:52.180
So you have different zones with
different political allegiances

01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:54.400
and different
leaders and all that.

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:59.590
The only way the Olympic
project happened,

01:19:59.590 --> 01:20:01.870
and only three or
four years have

01:20:01.870 --> 01:20:04.510
passed since we
had the games, was

01:20:04.510 --> 01:20:10.120
that the mayor put a red line
around the whole neighborhood

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:13.990
and called it a Mayoral
Development Corporation,

01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:16.060
literally took the
power of decision

01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:18.730
making away from the boroughs.

01:20:18.730 --> 01:20:20.560
In the most bizarre
way, that meant

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:23.080
that some of the bigger issues
of what London was about,

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:26.290
as opposed to the
parochial issues of which

01:20:26.290 --> 01:20:29.800
small community, have prevailed.

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:31.639
And we've ended up with
the sort of project

01:20:31.639 --> 01:20:32.680
that we're talking about.

01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:34.600
Now that is a
provocation, I realize,

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:37.160
because it's really
going against the grain

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:39.340
that small is beautiful
and every decision

01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:42.010
needs to be taken
at the lower level.

01:20:42.010 --> 01:20:45.430
I think you need some of
that big picture thinking,

01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:48.370
and big picture
institutional reframing

01:20:48.370 --> 01:20:49.900
to deliver some of these ideas.

01:20:52.410 --> 01:20:54.120
- I think that's
very interesting.

01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:57.450
Just a side note here,
one of the things

01:20:57.450 --> 01:20:59.160
that we've discovered
in the research

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:03.330
that we were doing in the Mellon
Initiative on four cities,

01:21:03.330 --> 01:21:08.400
we've been looking at Berlin,
Boston, Mumbai, and Istanbul,

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.250
is that, actually, one of the
interesting things about all

01:21:11.250 --> 01:21:16.080
these cities is that they
all seem to have a 2030 plan.

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:18.900
They have some
aspirational plan,

01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:21.840
that this is what we
want our city to be.

01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:26.070
Berlin is an open city that
welcomes migrants, that has

01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:28.350
opportunities, that does this.

01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:31.720
The Boston plan has similar
kinds of aspirations.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:35.040
But that is, I
think, a little bit--

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:38.010
of course, that's branding or
whatever you want to call it.

01:21:38.010 --> 01:21:39.680
But it's actually
more than that, too.

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:44.670
It's a sense of our
larger sense of the city

01:21:44.670 --> 01:21:48.360
as being an aspirational
place, actually.

01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:52.080
That you can try,
you have goals,

01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:53.640
that there are common goals.

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:56.340
And it's this notion of
the common good again.

01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:58.050
It's a romantic idea, perhaps.

01:21:58.050 --> 01:22:02.940
But I think that that's
part of this idea

01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:10.560
about the importance of the
plan as a narrative device,

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:11.190
actually.

01:22:11.190 --> 01:22:14.250
That our city is about this.

01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:16.110
Our city is about
sustainability.

01:22:16.110 --> 01:22:18.970
Our city is about equity.

01:22:18.970 --> 01:22:24.468
Anyhow, I want to open it up
to the audience for questions.

01:22:24.468 --> 01:22:27.070
- Hello, I'm a Ben
[? Bolcher, ?] an alum

01:22:27.070 --> 01:22:28.945
of the GST here at Harvard.

01:22:28.945 --> 01:22:31.540
This is a question for Ricky.

01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:34.600
It seems that there is
a very uneven record

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:38.860
of public investment in
Olympic projects historically,

01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:42.730
and at producing, and
that public value outcome.

01:22:42.730 --> 01:22:46.330
With regard to the
London project,

01:22:46.330 --> 01:22:48.850
is the kind of good
public outcome that

01:22:48.850 --> 01:22:51.640
is expected an
unintended consequence

01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:56.230
or are there structural lessons
to learn for future large scale

01:22:56.230 --> 01:22:59.600
projects of other Olympics
elsewhere from the London

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:00.100
example?

01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:04.900
- Thank you for the question.

01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:08.230
Of course, I'm biased in
answering that question.

01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:15.790
There are very, very
different outcomes

01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:19.000
to different Olympic projects.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.180
And what we did
in London was very

01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:25.330
simply follow the ones that
worked and studied them

01:23:25.330 --> 01:23:25.990
very carefully.

01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:30.070
And Barcelona clearly, of
the 1992 games of Barcelona,

01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:32.170
is a very clear
model, which goes back

01:23:32.170 --> 01:23:34.450
to exactly what Eve was saying.

01:23:34.450 --> 01:23:37.630
They were not shy about
having a social program.

01:23:37.630 --> 01:23:40.480
And the Olympics was a way of
achieving that social program.

01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:46.840
So I think, in that sense, we
did very much copy that model.

01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:49.900
There were examples
that we could look at,

01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:53.170
some of them, for
example, Athens,

01:23:53.170 --> 01:23:57.130
which had been recently held,
whereby vast investment had

01:23:57.130 --> 01:24:01.540
been made without any notion of
how the different venues would

01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:05.050
actually fit within the social,
economic, and cultural fabric

01:24:05.050 --> 01:24:06.410
of the city.

01:24:06.410 --> 01:24:08.110
And I know this is
dangerous territory,

01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:11.110
but the Atlanta and Los
Angeles models of Olympics

01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:13.960
are not necessarily
the best examples

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:18.430
of how to look at long
term sustainable commitment

01:24:18.430 --> 01:24:19.700
to the future of the city.

01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:22.840
If one thinks of what
happens in terms of riots

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:25.210
and elsewhere in Los
Angeles not that many years

01:24:25.210 --> 01:24:27.250
after those Olympic games.

01:24:27.250 --> 01:24:34.630
I think in terms of using the
London Olympics to do what it's

01:24:34.630 --> 01:24:38.260
trying to do, we
can't claim in any way

01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:40.870
that it's just the
London Olympics project.

01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:45.280
It fits into a much deeper,
longer term thinking

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:52.420
of how government can intervene
going back to Edgar's point

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:57.630
to redistribute wealth and
actually create greater equity

01:24:57.630 --> 01:24:59.100
across the surface of the city.

01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:01.680
So this was an
example, and I'm told

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.350
by a number of serious
economists that the London

01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:07.350
School of Economics
so it must be true,

01:25:07.350 --> 01:25:13.140
that we accelerated the
regeneration and possible

01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:17.070
equalization of London
by around 70 years

01:25:17.070 --> 01:25:18.654
as a result of this process.

01:25:18.654 --> 01:25:20.070
But it was going
to happen anyway.

01:25:25.501 --> 01:25:26.000
- Hello.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.230
My name is Dale Hepler.

01:25:27.230 --> 01:25:29.870
I'm an architect here in Boston.

01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:32.222
My question is for Edgar.

01:25:32.222 --> 01:25:35.570
You used a phrase a couple of
times that I found intriguing.

01:25:35.570 --> 01:25:39.470
You were saying
narrative-based planning.

01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:42.170
I was hoping you could
explain a little bit more

01:25:42.170 --> 01:25:45.410
how narrative
influences planning,

01:25:45.410 --> 01:25:50.000
or especially in the range
of talks we've heard today.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.050
- Yeah, so it actually connects
very directly to Eve's point.

01:25:53.050 --> 01:25:55.400
So I think that-- and
also some of the points

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:56.930
Ricky has been making.

01:25:56.930 --> 01:25:59.360
So we've got to recognize
that there's, of course,

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:01.250
different scales at play.

01:26:01.250 --> 01:26:06.830
And we need a different set
of practices and processes

01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:09.590
and sense and
institutional sensibilities

01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:11.280
at these different scales.

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:13.790
So if we go back to the
earlier panels of today dealing

01:26:13.790 --> 01:26:18.470
with climate impacts, crisis of
water management and so forth,

01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:21.710
these require, by definition,
a metropolitan regional

01:26:21.710 --> 01:26:22.490
perspective.

01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:27.080
You can't resolve those
questions one block at a time.

01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:30.680
And it is impossible, because
of the sheer complexity

01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:34.160
and going back, I guess, to the
big data point this morning,

01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:38.750
to in a way have an
inclusive democratic process,

01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:42.260
to deliberate on those questions
at the scale of the city

01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:43.970
region.

01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:47.690
So the tendency towards
these 2030 plans,

01:26:47.690 --> 01:26:50.930
2040 plans and so
forth, is a reflection

01:26:50.930 --> 01:26:54.140
of trying to construct a
narrative that can deal

01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:56.150
with that regional complexity.

01:26:56.150 --> 01:26:59.180
And the key word that emerges
typically from those plans

01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:01.610
is this idea of
growth management.

01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:04.700
And in the last five years,
you combine growth management

01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:06.230
with resilience, right?

01:27:06.230 --> 01:27:09.560
And then your consultancy
practice will,

01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:11.510
you know, good business
for the next 20 years.

01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:17.870
So this is where the rub lies.

01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:20.630
That, of course, when you
talk about growth management

01:27:20.630 --> 01:27:24.710
or resilience,
immediately a whole suite

01:27:24.710 --> 01:27:28.490
of stabilized meanings
come to the fore

01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:31.830
that are mediated by
consultancy practices.

01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:35.270
And I think this is incredibly
dangerous, because people stop

01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:39.170
to think, they stop to
really work with the data,

01:27:39.170 --> 01:27:42.590
and they stop to
bring to forward

01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:46.820
the constitutive conflicts
and conflicts of interest,

01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:50.990
both generationally and at
the city-regional scale.

01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:53.150
Which is why the London
example is so interesting

01:27:53.150 --> 01:27:56.420
is precisely because it
takes a regional perspective

01:27:56.420 --> 01:27:59.750
and says that's the
zone of deep deprivation

01:27:59.750 --> 01:28:01.916
with cumulative disadvantage.

01:28:01.916 --> 01:28:03.290
And at the same
time, when you're

01:28:03.290 --> 01:28:06.530
going to pop $50
billion, you've got

01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:09.080
to think about three
generations into the future

01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:11.870
and who represents
their interests.

01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:14.630
So I think that, for me,
the narrative is then

01:28:14.630 --> 01:28:17.960
how do we foreground the
tradeoffs and the decisions

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:20.300
and the assumptions
of that narrative?

01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:23.270
And for me, the planning
process could, potentially,

01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:26.960
if it is curated properly,
could service that

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:30.230
and at least have an
informed public discourse.

01:28:30.230 --> 01:28:32.720
So because the issue is not
that that gives you the best

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:35.930
outcome, but it creates
a democratic atmosphere

01:28:35.930 --> 01:28:39.860
within which a certain political
leadership is called for.

01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:43.310
And that's what we need is
the politicization of planning

01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:45.790
and that the right
kinds of pressure points

01:28:45.790 --> 01:28:48.480
are applied by a
plurality of interests.

01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:52.070
And at the same time, at
the local level, for me

01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:53.090
it's very clear.

01:28:53.090 --> 01:28:57.440
If I look at a crowd, or I look
at a slum in Cape Town or so,

01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:00.560
that people's kind of
social, reproductive needs

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:02.975
are what all of us
aspire to and want--

01:29:02.975 --> 01:29:06.710
is our kids in a good
school, not being exposed

01:29:06.710 --> 01:29:12.500
to sexual predators, being able
to access good quality food,

01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:14.840
have energy security, et cetera.

01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:16.310
So this is not rocket science.

01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:17.840
We know this.

01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:21.980
But the point is that because
of this cumulative process

01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:24.710
of exclusion and
social injustice,

01:29:24.710 --> 01:29:27.170
it is very complex to
work out where do you

01:29:27.170 --> 01:29:31.270
get the resources to intervene
in a dense, if you will,

01:29:31.270 --> 01:29:33.550
milieu of compensation.

01:29:33.550 --> 01:29:35.350
Where people have
kind of improvised

01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:38.480
to do all kinds of things
to get by, but even that,

01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:42.140
at the intimate scale, are shot
through with power relations.

01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:46.880
So how do we build a way
of opening up those logics

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:49.700
through the voice
and the practices

01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:52.730
and the experience of people
who live there, who constitute

01:29:52.730 --> 01:29:56.870
that reality, and animate that
in a pedagogic way for them

01:29:56.870 --> 01:30:00.770
to imagine other possibilities
and other ways of doing?

01:30:00.770 --> 01:30:03.590
And I think we're at a very
interesting cusp, where

01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:06.830
if you look at what's happening
in East Africa with micro-grids

01:30:06.830 --> 01:30:10.100
and energy systems that is
working off M-Pesa, which

01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:19.430
is a mobile phone, a dumb mobile
phone financial system that

01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:22.790
is enabling new
micro-grids to be operated

01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:26.260
by slum dwellers themselves.

01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:27.990
And that's one example.

01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:30.200
So the point is that
planning in that context

01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:35.260
is about making legible
a narrative people have

01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:36.570
of how they get by.

01:30:36.570 --> 01:30:39.300
But also, if one animated,
which is the planning

01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:43.830
part, in a creative way, one can
build new imaginations of what

01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:45.360
that neighborhood could become.

01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:48.570
And so narrative, I think,
works at different scales

01:30:48.570 --> 01:30:49.530
in different ways.

01:30:49.530 --> 01:30:52.590
But you need very different
pedagogic techniques

01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:56.090
to build that narrative
and to build it critically.

01:30:56.090 --> 01:30:58.740
- Thank you.

01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:01.170
- If resiliency also
means pulling back

01:31:01.170 --> 01:31:04.620
in the not so far future,
like Miami or Lagos,

01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:08.190
or for that matter, London,
as the seas get higher,

01:31:08.190 --> 01:31:09.660
you're going to lose some land.

01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:11.670
You may not have the
space or the infilling,

01:31:11.670 --> 01:31:13.690
like you just explained.

01:31:13.690 --> 01:31:16.140
You're going to have to
go somewhere or go up.

01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:17.580
What type of
planning is at least

01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:20.520
being conceptualized
to try to do--

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:22.710
a Dutch solution only
buys you some time.

01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:26.790
If the seas keep
rising as projected,

01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:28.336
we have time to plan for that.

01:31:28.336 --> 01:31:30.210
But it still means you've
got to go somewhere

01:31:30.210 --> 01:31:32.670
with a lot of people
that have been displaced

01:31:32.670 --> 01:31:34.740
or a lot of facilities,
such as sewer plants

01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:36.323
or what have you,
that are going to be

01:31:36.323 --> 01:31:37.713
displaced by this activity.

01:31:40.431 --> 01:31:42.510
- I mean, Dilip
is in the audience

01:31:42.510 --> 01:31:48.310
so there's no way I'm responding
to that question, right?

01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:50.940
So I think that--
and Ricky will have

01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:54.630
things to say about this
because the LSE city center runs

01:31:54.630 --> 01:31:57.300
an expansive research
program in different cities

01:31:57.300 --> 01:32:01.050
on questions of climate
adaptation and resilience.

01:32:01.050 --> 01:32:03.840
But just to say very
briefly that, of course,

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:08.520
there are the big events in
terms of the large climate

01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:10.017
impacts and the
form of sea level

01:32:10.017 --> 01:32:11.100
rise and the consequences.

01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:16.230
But, of course, a more critical
and important aspect of that

01:32:16.230 --> 01:32:18.990
is the immediate
climate variability,

01:32:18.990 --> 01:32:21.270
and the way in
which that impacts,

01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:23.546
in a highly disproportionate
way on the most

01:32:23.546 --> 01:32:25.920
vulnerable in the city, which,
of course, are the poorest

01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:28.200
people who live in
the most precarious

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:30.490
environmentally sensitive areas.

01:32:30.490 --> 01:32:32.386
So I think it is very
important, and it's

01:32:32.386 --> 01:32:36.690
the only point I will make, that
we don't slip into a discourse

01:32:36.690 --> 01:32:39.340
that this is something that
allows for anticipatory

01:32:39.340 --> 01:32:40.710
planning over the long term.

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:46.610
The devastation
is happening now.

01:32:46.610 --> 01:32:48.620
Ricky?

01:32:48.620 --> 01:32:50.420
- Well, I mean,
again, there are so

01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:54.080
many other people who know
more about this than I do,

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:55.880
and probably in the room.

01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:58.400
And the difference between
mitigation and adaptation

01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:02.060
is central to this very
intelligent question.

01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:07.310
All I would say is
that controlling land,

01:33:07.310 --> 01:33:08.897
not just in terms
of speculation,

01:33:08.897 --> 01:33:10.730
which is what Eve had
said at the beginning,

01:33:10.730 --> 01:33:15.680
but in terms of where land
is most risky, stopping

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:19.370
informal development happening
exactly in those areas

01:33:19.370 --> 01:33:21.830
which is most risky--

01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:25.940
think of Jakarta, think of
Lagos, think of elsewhere--

01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:30.260
requires a degree
of political control

01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:33.590
which unfortunately is missing
in many of these areas.

01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:36.290
Referring to the point that
Edgar has made about our work

01:33:36.290 --> 01:33:39.980
is certainly an intelligent
and well-planned form

01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:44.510
of high density development must
be the answer to this, because

01:33:44.510 --> 01:33:47.660
of the critical mass and
also the structural solidity.

01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:50.000
But also being pragmatic
and realistic about it.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.690
The best example I know
is the whole redevelopment

01:33:53.690 --> 01:33:58.610
of the waterfront area in
Hamburg called HafenCity,

01:33:58.610 --> 01:34:00.680
where basically it's
acknowledged that there

01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:07.220
will be a five meter devastating
flood at some point in time.

01:34:07.220 --> 01:34:08.780
And therefore the
city has actually

01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:11.810
been designed in such a way
that only garages, depots,

01:34:11.810 --> 01:34:18.080
and a degree of retail is in
that lower level, landscaping

01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:19.040
and much else.

01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:21.800
Actually, some of it
incredibly beautiful.

01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:25.610
But it doesn't stop the
city from actually expanding

01:34:25.610 --> 01:34:29.180
into the port area and making
it a very important addition

01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:29.690
to the city.

01:34:29.690 --> 01:34:34.910
But taking completely
in mind that you

01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:38.750
don't want to expose
people, and particularly

01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:43.100
those who are most at risk
as Edgar has described.

01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:45.930
In the case of
London, very simply,

01:34:45.930 --> 01:34:49.100
if you went a bit, two
miles further east of where

01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:52.670
the Olympics are, you would
actually be within a flood zone

01:34:52.670 --> 01:34:56.600
and different regulations apply
to how housing is actually

01:34:56.600 --> 01:35:00.160
built.

01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:03.400
- I think that our time is up.

01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:07.210
We can continue conversations
at the reception.

01:35:07.210 --> 01:35:09.490
I think there's a
reception following.

01:35:09.490 --> 01:35:11.740
And I want to
thank our speakers,

01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:13.430
and I want to
thank our audience.

01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:16.810
And I want to thank
Radcliffe and Liz Cohen,

01:35:16.810 --> 01:35:20.050
again, for hosting this event.

01:35:20.050 --> 01:35:21.881
And thank you very much.

01:35:21.881 --> 01:35:28.480
[APPLAUSE]

01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:31.980
- I'd just like to make a
few very brief remarks just

01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:34.170
to close things out.

01:35:34.170 --> 01:35:38.760
I think this conference
has proved its own title,

01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:42.180
Intersections-- that we require
many different disciplines

01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:45.120
and voices and
perspectives in order

01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:49.170
to work on the complex
phenomenon of urbanism.

01:35:49.170 --> 01:35:50.850
When we first
started this project,

01:35:50.850 --> 01:35:53.880
Eve drew my attention
to a small book

01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:57.440
written by the French Marxist
sociologist and philosopher

01:35:57.440 --> 01:35:59.160
Henri Lefebvre.

01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:01.800
His much better known work,
The Production of Space

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:05.250
is one of my faves, but I
hadn't known about his shorter

01:36:05.250 --> 01:36:07.740
book, The Urban Revolution.

01:36:07.740 --> 01:36:10.620
And in that book which he
wrote nearly 50 years ago

01:36:10.620 --> 01:36:13.830
he made a distinction
between the urban phenomenon

01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:17.760
and the city that I think has
even greater resonance for us

01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:18.810
today.

01:36:18.810 --> 01:36:21.060
According to the
Lefebvre, the city

01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:23.610
is a term that
attempts to designate

01:36:23.610 --> 01:36:28.680
a clearly defined, definitive
object, a scientific object.

01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:32.040
Whereas the urban, he
says, is pure form--

01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:36.360
a place of encounter,
assembly and simultaneity.

01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:39.450
This form has no
content, but is a center

01:36:39.450 --> 01:36:41.640
of attraction and life.

01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:44.970
The urban is neither
an object, substance,

01:36:44.970 --> 01:36:47.550
nor a subject, consciousness.

01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:51.820
The urban phenomenon is
made manifest as movement.

01:36:51.820 --> 01:36:55.440
So that's Lefebvre, way
back, almost 50 years ago.

01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:59.130
I hope this conference has
helped us to think together

01:36:59.130 --> 01:37:02.400
about how to approach
this dynamic moving

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:07.020
target of urbanism in the global
age, issues in which we all

01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:08.280
have a stake.

01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:13.410
Before we close, I would like
to thank all of our speakers.

01:37:13.410 --> 01:37:15.610
I would like to thank
the Academic Venture

01:37:15.610 --> 01:37:19.440
staff, especially to Jessica
Vickland, the Director

01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:21.300
of Events at
Radcliffe, who handled

01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:24.240
all of the logistics for
the entire conference,

01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:27.990
and the entire events and
facilities teams at Radcliffe.

01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:30.270
I'd like to thank
Becky Wasserman, who's

01:37:30.270 --> 01:37:32.730
the Executive Director
of Academic Ventures, who

01:37:32.730 --> 01:37:35.490
did so much to
support us in putting

01:37:35.490 --> 01:37:37.530
this conference into place.

01:37:37.530 --> 01:37:40.690
And then, last and
certainly not least,

01:37:40.690 --> 01:37:44.010
I'd like to thank Dean Liz
Cohen for the tremendous support

01:37:44.010 --> 01:37:45.750
that she gave to the
Mellon Initiative

01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:48.210
when it first began
four years ago.

01:37:48.210 --> 01:37:52.290
It's been a very rich valuable
experience for all of us.

01:37:52.290 --> 01:37:56.040
And I think this conference was
the right culminating event.

01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:57.930
So thank you for being with us.

01:38:02.050 --> 01:38:04.120
- Now my turn to
ask you to help me

01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:08.040
thank the organizers, who
did a really terrific job.
