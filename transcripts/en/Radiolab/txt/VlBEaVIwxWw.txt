Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radiolab radio from W. N. Y. S. T. E. Yup. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich. I'm Molly Webster. This is Radiolab and today

Speaker 1:          00:16          we've got breaking news. Robert Krulwich on Rick break. This is something we've never done before. Never done before. What does anybody know about this yet? Well, it is a new bit of research. It's being published today. We've known about it for the last few months, but we haven't been able to talk about it until now. What's this thing about? Oh, this is a discovery about Alzheimer's disease, which I think at this point is something that affects basically every family affected my family. Yeah. And this is a discovery that is not a cure, but it's basically about looking at the brain, which is one of the most complicated things in the universe, I think. And poking at it in this super simple way and getting this bizarre result that's pretty, pretty bizarre. Hello? Hello? Hello. Hi Molly. Hi. How are you? All right. So last May, I was talking to some folks over at the brain institute at MIT and while I was on the phone with them, they started telling me about some research that hadn't been published yet.

Speaker 1:          01:20          So it was all very hush. Hush is pretty cool though. We ended up deciding to sign a nondisclosure agreement and it was based on the work of this woman. Leeway tie the way. Tie, tie, tie tie a, I'm a professor and the director of the Pico Institute for learning a memory at MIT. Holy Crap. You're a director. How do you have time to do? Oh, that's a good question. She is was like a bad ass is what she is about. This is a piece of work. Um, I'm very proud of and very excited about. Okay, cool. So let me, let me begin. Okay, so he's Dory Culley people work on Alzheimer's, really focused. So I would say generally when you talk to researchers about Alzheimer's disease, they either focus on individual genetic factors, the genetics of the disease, so the genes that predispose you maybe to Alzheimer's or the brain chemistry and how Alzheimer's affects the chemicals in the brain.

Speaker 1:          02:19          Molay killer pathological features that in my conversation with leeway, she was talking about something totally different. We, we, we sort of look at it from a different angle. Her work all centers around something called the gamma frequency gamma and what is gay? I'm like, it feels like something from Battlestar Galactica, so I don't think it's that you could think of it as a particular beat in your brain, in the brain, which means let things likely. Well, just to oversimplify one of the most complicated things in the known universe. Okay, please do. You've got your brain. It's full of neurons, which are a certain type of brain cell. We have billions of neurons in the brain. They have these long tentacles that are reaching out towards other neurons and for the brain to function, neurons have to communicate with each other to process inflammation. And the way they do that is they fire.

Speaker 1:          03:23          Yes, an electrical signal. We'll go through them and it'll like zap another neuron and it'll turn it on and then in a like an electrical signal, we'll go through it and then it'll zap another neuron and it'll turn it on. But the cool thing is is that when your brain is doing things like making you move or write a poem or think great thoughts, groups of neurons fire in sync all together on the same beat and there's a bunch of different beats that happen in the brain. Some of them are slow, like one beat per second and that's when you're sleeping. If you're beating around 10 beats per second, like maybe you're sitting next to a campfire in an Adirondack chair or on like the totally other end of the spectrum, like some neurons fire at 600 beats per second or do they do that? I have no idea what all this is going on. In your head simultaneously. Yeah, yeah. No, that's the cool thing is that when all of these beats in your brain come together, that's when you're able to process the world and understand it as it exists as human beings.

Speaker 2:          04:27          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          04:31          Huh? But getting back to our story, when your brain is doing something really tricky that requires super focused tension, working memory and so on, do like trying to find your way home from the subway station. Or if you're in a new city, you know, navigate around it. There's a certain beat, it sort of rises above them all. And that is the so called gamma frequency. This range between 30 beats per second all the way up to a hundred beats per second. And this gamma frequency has been, uh, considered to be very important for the higher order cognitive function. And the interesting thing is that when you look at an Alzheimer's brain, what you see is there's actually less gamma happening or people say like the power of Gamma is reduced. Now all the neurons can be recruited to oscillate at the gamma frequency. It's still there. It's just quieter. It's like you turn the volume down. Right.

Speaker 1:          05:29          All right, so just to briefly sum up here, what we've got is a rhythm which we call gamma, which is used when we have complicated or higher thoughts in the brain, which when you got Alzheimer's kind of get saggy retired. Yeah, totally. And of course, obviously in an Alzheimer's brain there's a lot going on and this is just one of the things, right? You've got the plaques that build up around the neurons, this stuff that ducks up your brain and makes it hard to think. Yeah, totally. It's like cobwebs in the brain and then the connections between neurons gets all muddied and immune cells get messed up. But leeway tie was like, forget all that. What would happen if I just bring the gamma back? Yeah. We decided to just manipulate gamma oscillations.

Speaker 1:          06:17          And how do you, how do you do that? Well, hello. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello. Hello Technology. Hi, this is Molly. Hi. Hi. Hi. Technology you can find at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. And actually I went and took a train up to Boston to MIT not too long ago, walking in, did a big hour institute. It's a big shiny glass building. Why eventually leeway tie came striding into her office to meet me. And my understanding is that you want to see some of the experimental setup. And so we way led me down the hall to this tiny room. The mice just entered the room, brought in these adorable little mice. Oh my gosh. They're like little black and soft and furry. Yeah. Their ears are tagged with a little metal tag on that. Yeah. Okay. So, so here's what they did. They get some ice.

Speaker 1:          07:09          We started off with a mouse model, not the mice. I actually got all excited over, but my set at an early stage of Alzheimer's disease was my depo. Notable defects. And do they have the gunky plaque stuff in them yet or is that later? No, but they do have elevated levels of um, open amyloid peptides, which is this protein that forms the plaques. So it's like basically preplan gunk. But the important thing to leeway tie in our team is that they have less gamma going on in their brains. If you remember, the whole plan here is to bring the gamma back. Yes. So to do that, they get what might be the world's tiniest drill and they drill a small hole into the skull of the mouse and then they take a really thin fiber optic cable. They slide it through the hole into the brain, and then they get this laser of blue light to flicker at 40 beats per second. Yeah, Ma frequency. And they turn that on and the light travels

Speaker 3:          08:05          down the fiber optic cable deep down into the brain, to this group of cells that they've modified in the hippocampus to be sensitive to light. So when this pulsing light hit the cells, they actually began to fire at 40 beats per second at gamma frequency. And they would keep these cells firing a gamma for one hour, firing and firing and firing and firing and firing. And then

Speaker 1:          08:27          after one hour they turn off the light. And then eventually they started looking at the brains of these mice trying to figure out if anything was different after the light flashed and they see to our much surprise or not expecting this at all, we found after they shot this pulsing light into the brain, there was suddenly nearly half as much of that soon to be nasty plaque, gunk stuff that was filling up their hippocampus. [inaudible] half the, yeah. Yes. Half of the stuff was just swept away. Yes. 40 to 50% reduction of Beta amyloid. That just seems crazy. This is crazy. I mean, we were just so surprised. They know why the, yeah. Yeah, so turned out to the pulsing light somehow triggered the brain's cleanup crew, microglia. These cells in the brain that are called Microglia, you can say they're the janitors of the brain, and in a normal brain, these janitor cells usually gobble up the gunk.

Speaker 1:          09:26          But in Alzheimer's disease it's known that Michael [inaudible], they don't sort of function normally anymore. It's like these janitors just sort of stop cleaning up and go on strike. There we go. Okay, cool. Okay. So we're looking at a screen that's now flat. It's not, not when I was at MIT, one of Leeways Grad students, my name is Anthony March row. Second Year was showing me side by side comparisons of these mice brains on the screen. Can you guess what that is? Which part? The green things. Microglia. And you see after one hour of gamma. Wow. So that, yeah, that the Michael [inaudible] the cell seems a lot bigger clearly. See these round bodies. Yeah. And also the bally sims will have more amyloid. Oh, like they're doing more eating. Yes. They go back to eat more amyloid again. It's like somehow making the neurons fire turned on the sanitation system in the brain.

Speaker 1:          10:26          But the most wild results, wait, there's more wild, oh my God, you gotta hear this because what I'm about to tell you, you may say no, I don't believe it. It's science fiction. Okay. So, so one of the things leeway and her team were starting to think was that drilling and fiber optic cable is very invasive. Right. You'd never be able to do that on a human. Exactly. So we started to say, well, what if we can get the light into the brain in a different way? Like maybe we could go through the eyes towing the hole in your head would be your eyes instead of a whole. Yes. So leeway and her team created what I like to think of as the flicker room. This is the room, this is the room, and then it turns out, I learned upon my visit, it is just a storage closet.

Speaker 1:          11:17          You know you have a, what is this? Just like a plastic table. Very DIY. Yeah, it's a, it's a plastic table you can buy at target. There were some plastic shoe box size containers lined up on the table for the mice. And then see the strip around the edge of the table physically surrounding all the pages are duck tape strips of led lights. And the reason why we use LEDs is because a regular light bulb, it can't flash fast enough. And so the idea is what if we just put the mice in this room and just let the light flicker at 40 beats per second. So you want to show Molly like attorneys on, yeah, and so we turn off the overhead light in the room, so it's very black and white

Speaker 3:          11:58          then. Oh Wow. The room was now glowing with this white led light. Okay. So the light is turning on and off 40 times a second. It's so there's, you know, you don't see anything going like on or off. It just looks like something's on. But it kind of feels like my eye is twitching and so it's blurring the blurring the light a little just on the edges though, on the edges.

Speaker 1:          12:20          And do they put mice in this room for an hour and just let them kind of bays bathe in this, in this glow. And guess what? What we look at the amyloid Beta levels in the visual cortex and we found there is a 50% reduction, 50% 50% of the doctors shining light in their eyeballs. Yes they did. They didn't do any drilling or anything? No, they didn't drill. They didn't tweak the mouse's brain cells to be sensitive to light. This is just the room with occasional LEDs flashing at a particular frequency for an hour. Now do you see, are you going to tell me? I don't believe it is science fiction.

Speaker 1:          13:05          And they follow this study up with another study which was done in the same way. So at the same flicker room light through the eyeballs and only this time they put the mice in there for one hour a day for seven days and they took mice that had full blown Alzheimer's. So this is like cognitive decline. They're forgetting things and they've got hardened plaques in their brain and they see the same thing. Nearly half of the stuff was cleared away. Half. It's just flickering light in front of the mice. That's the shot. I mean that's the shocking thing. The thing I didn't understand after talking to you about your study was I was like, why hasn't everyone done this before? Like why didn't everyone go? We should just shine light through eyes. See? Well you know, that's really the most unexpected and exciting aspect of our study, which is some sin this simple.

Speaker 1:          14:01          Yet. You know it has never been done before. You know that. One of the things, one of the caveats here is that if you don't do the flicker light room every 24 hours, the level of gunk in the brain starts going back up again and so now they're trying to figure out how they can keep those levels down. Maybe even for good if the mouse no longer has quite as much junk in its head. Does that mean that it can remember things that happened to it? Yeah. Yeah. That is their big next research. That's what they are. They don't know that's what they're to. That is now the next step, but nobody really understands how plaques and the gunk buildup in the brain relates to memory and cognition and the dogma in the field is that when you have Alzheimer's, you can't form new memories and once you lose a memory, it's gone for good. But there is another group at MIT that is actually sort of challenging that assumption that you can never get a memory back because the patient could never tell us. We all assumed the information had to be gone. Oh really? Yeah, and we'll get to them, but first we have to go to a break.

Speaker 1:          16:09          I'm Robert Krulwich. I'm Molly Webster. Yes, he is radio lab and we're back. And just before the break you said that there may be a way to bring a memory back from the Alzheimer's. Does pull the memory back into back into place. Yeah. Why? Why are we so quick to jump to the conclusion that the information was somehow completely gone? And the person who said that to me is this guy, I'm Dheeraj Roy, I'm a fourth year graduate student in the Sumo Tonegawa lab over at the town of gala lab. They were thinking, what if we could figure out exactly where the memory should be in the brain and just give that spot a little bit of juice, right? So they took some mice that were just starting to lose their ability to remember things and they thought, okay, let's try to give them a memory. We put them in a box that has a particular smell, some sort of lighting and some texture on their feet. A little mouse carpet or that's exactly what it is. Yeah. Okay. My son cockpits. Got It. The point is the box looks and feels and smells different than any other box they would hang out in. And then you'd give them a light electrical shock. And the mice, they just freeze. They don't move at all, which is a sign that they're afraid, the hate the box

Speaker 2:          17:20          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          17:21          and for the rest of the afternoon, which is a very long time and mouse time, they go on hating the box, which means with the carpet and the light and the smell, if you put it back in there, it'll freeze because it remembers the shot. Yes. But a day or a week later, which when the same mice were put back into the same box, instead of being scared of the box, they would just continue investigating as if nothing happened. They could not remember. So Dheeraj and his team did leeway, did they got some modified mice and then they put a little hole in their head. They slid in a fiber optic cable, they [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          17:54          shine some light to trigger the neurons if they think hold this memory. And they were a fear section near the fear section. So leading on the path to the fear section. So we do this and then

Speaker 1:          18:07          put them back into the box, the box with a particular lighting and smell and carpet and ask, is there any change in their behavior? Will they act afraid again? Do they show any more memory? And they did wait. Shut up. They actually were scared of the box again. Exactly. They showed recovered memory. Wow. Oh, so that's like Bam. That memory is in there.

Speaker 5:          18:32          Exactly. [inaudible] behaviors back

Speaker 1:          18:36          and you can dig up the memory by shining light in the right place. Yeah. I was always under the impression that the memories were totally lost. Right. So I think that's not just you. I think that's essentially the entire field, what you described just because, and that's good because the patient could never tell us. We all assume that the information had to be gone. Huh. So one of the things to say is that Dheeraj did tell me that, you know, all of the experiments they did are in mice that have early Alzheimer's. Uh, the thought is though is that once you get to the late stage of the disease, there's enough damage in the brain that you really wouldn't be able to get those memories back.

Speaker 5:          19:16          That might be right that a memory lost is just lost. But you know, when you, when you have someone in your house and you, um, and you live with this disease day in and day out, the disease just goes its own way and it can puzzle you or frighten you or suddenly declare something new that you didn't expect. So for example, my dad had it for about nine, 10 years. Uh, it was a slow, active disappearing that he did where, I mean, the last time my father came to was so far into the disease, he hadn't spoken for a year and a half. He was sitting at the table for the Passover Seder and there's a song that you sing and it goes, died a new die, die. Ain't no [inaudible]. So it's just a chorus. And from out of nowhere, this being at the end of the table, who I knew was my father, who hadn't spoken in a year and a half or two and had not spoken coherently for three, suddenly flew into the song

Speaker 6:          20:36          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          20:36          and sang the song full throated Lee at the table.

Speaker 6:          20:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          20:45          the reappearance of some just figment

Speaker 7:          20:47          of himself.

Speaker 2:          20:51          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          20:51          and it was, it was both horrifying and extraordinary. Both, you know. Yeah. I think that's the fact that maybe some information still the persists. Hopefully someday we get kind of, maybe there's something we could do. Um, but yeah,

Speaker 1:          21:10          [inaudible] in my mind at the moment, as long as we can figure out how to reboot the pathway to retrieve the memory, then I think there is hope. This is the way tie again, but you know, I, I personally seeing the most important question is whether humans respond similarly. I mean, keep in mind that both Daraja study and leeway ties are in mice, not humans. Right. So I do have a thought that like, why, like, um, is there a reason that a human neuron might react differently than a mouse? The thing is as thing, especially, you know, in Alzheimer's feel, I mean, people got burned a lot. Yeah. Just, you know, there's like a 99.6% failure rate in moving something that seemed to work in mice to humans in Alzheimer's. Yeah. Yeah. That was a study that came out in 2012. That's a horrible number. So I just gotta be really conservative here.

Speaker 1:          22:15          Dial it back. I'll dial it back. You know, all we have in mice, the just, just so exciting and so unexpected, so much fun. Um, but you know, I'm gonna keep my mind open when it comes to humans. The plan is, is that we're going to find out because they're going straight to humans. Oh. So can do human trials. Well, they want to, so yeah, I guess we'll see. This is the glorious part of all this. This organ of ours, the brain is so crazily complicated with like whatever, 100 trillion connections or whatever it is. There's so much chance. There's gonna be a lot of surprise. Yeah. It's like almost, even if it doesn't lead to any, uh, treatment in humans or, um, something super concrete. It's like, we know this little secret about the brain now, and there's something that feels like beautiful in that. Yeah. I'm actually, I'm setting this up for my Christmas tree. Are you really? Yes. Oh wait, I just bought the new led lights and they can, they can flick her a different color with different colors. Each individual bulb can travel through colors, but while they're doing that, they're going to be flickering at 40. Well, you're going to have a very therapeutic Christmas in the, in the leeway tie household. This is the tree in your home. Oh, yes. Yes. Are you using, I want to have an eggnog next to that tree.
