00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.179
The Christmas Truce of WWI

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:05.620
On the whole, people don’t generally like
to kill one another.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.780
Most wars throughout history are often more
about the agendas of the state’s leaders

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.240
than the soldiers on the field actually inherently
feeling any real malice towards those they

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.429
are asked to try to kill or otherwise defeat.

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.480
Few events in history illustrate this as well
as a remarkable episode that took place during

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.640
WWI when, despite the orders of their commanding
officers and leaders, the soldiers threw aside

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.949
their weapons, got out of the trenches and
had a make-shift Christmas party with those

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.140
that just hours before they’d been trying
to kill.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.860
This momentous event has become known as The
Christmas Truce.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.920
Leading up to this impromptu truce in 1914,
Pope Benedict XV had asked that the various

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.450
governments participating in the war would
negotiate a truce for one day, so that “the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.450
guns may fall silent at least upon the night
the angels sang.”

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.489
There was also an “Open Christmas Letter”
sent out by British women’s suffragists

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.620
to the women of Germany and Austria, asking
for peace.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.460
(The German women’s suffragists responded
in kind and an exchange of letters ensued

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.699
where they discussed peace and the horror
of “modern” war.)

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.840
In the United States, a resolution was submitted
in the Senate attempting to get the warring

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.620
countries to stop fighting for 20 days leading
up to and including Christmas “with the

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.920
hope that the cessation of hostilities at
the said time may stimulate reflection upon

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.799
the part of the nations at war as to the meaning
and spirit of Christmas time.”

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.710
The leaders of the warring nations paid little
attentions to these attempts at peace.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.350
The American weekly, The New Republic, noted
just before Christmas of 1914,

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.540
“If men must hate, it is perhaps just as
well that they make no Christmas truce…

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.860
The stench of the battle should rise above
the churches where they preach good-will to

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.860
men.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.619
A few carols, a little incense and some tinsel
will heal no wounds…

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.330
[A truce would be] so empty that it jeers
at us.”

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.840
But a somewhat alarming (to the commanding
officers and leaders of the nations) trend

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.409
had already started occurring amongst the
troops on both sides leading up to the truce.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.610
Stuck knee deep in their muddy trenches along
lines so close together, the soldiers on both

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.649
sides, who’d commonly thrown insults back
and forth, started adopting a slightly more

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.810
apathetic view of the war, more of a “live
and let live” policy.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.349
In some cases, they even started tossing newspapers
and other things back and forth, bartering

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.990
for supplies like cigarettes, rations and
the like, and holding conversations across

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.569
the trenches.

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.740
As one Royal Engineer, Andrew Todd said,
“Perhaps it will surprise you to learn that

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.690
the soldiers in both lines of trenches have
become very ‘pally’ with each other.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.200
The trenches are only 60 yards apart at one
place, and every morning about breakfast time

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.420
one of the soldiers sticks a board in the
air.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.720
As soon as this board goes up all firing ceases,
and men from either side draw their water

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.800
and rations.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.050
All through the breakfast hour, and so long
as this board is up, silence reigns supreme,

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.849
but whenever the board comes down, the first
unlucky devil who shows even so much as a

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.500
hand gets a bullet through it.”

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.569
Another such temporary truce instance occurred
on December 19, (recounted by Lieutenant Geoffrey

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.680
Heinekey):
“…a most extraordinary thing happened…

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.080
Some Germans came out and held up their hands
and began to take in some of their wounded

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.870
and so we ourselves immediately got out of
our trenches and began bringing in our wounded

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:13.870
also.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.470
The Germans then beckoned to us and a lot
of us went over and talked to them and they

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.630
helped us to bury our dead.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.510
This lasted the whole morning and I talked
to several of them and I must say they seemed

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.629
extraordinarily fine men…

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.920
It seems too ironical for words.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.181
There, the night before we had been having
a terrific battle and the morning after, there

00:03:32.181 --> 00:03:36.120
we were smoking their cigarettes and they
smoking ours.”

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.450
This type of behavior, perhaps inherent in
any war where the two sides have to live and

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.410
fight in such close proprieties and for such
a long duration, began popping up more and

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.470
more in sections of the line, prompting the
army leaders to issue strict orders forbidding

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.610
any fraternization with the “enemy”.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.280
These incidents of temporary peace along the
line typically didn’t last very long and

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.530
were never wide spread, happening in very
small pockets.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.200
This changed on Christmas Eve of 1914 beginning
along the trenches near Ypres, Belgium.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.170
It is reported that it started with the Germans
setting up Christmas trees, singing carols,

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.600
and lighting candles.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.030
The British and French then responded in kind,
singing along, and soon the two sides in various

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.699
places along the line were wishing each other
happy holidays.

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.660
Even more surprising between these two groups
that were previously exchanging shots and

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.010
explosives was that they now began exchanging
Christmas gifts, handshakes, hugs, playing

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.120
games, drinking, and generally having a good
time with one another.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.240
There are even reports of prayer circles formed
with members of both sides taking part.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.110
In a letter home, one British soldier wrote,
“Just you think, that while you were eating

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.150
your turkey…, I was out talking and shaking
hands with the very men I had been trying

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.850
to kill a few hours before!

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.250
It was astounding!”

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.229
Another soldier, Bruce Barinsfather noted,
“I wouldn’t have missed that unique and

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.139
weird Christmas Day for anything.

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.960
… I spotted a German officer, some sort
of lieutenant I should think, and being a

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.949
bit of a collector, I intimated to him that
I had taken a fancy to some of his buttons.

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.449
… I brought out my wire clippers and, with
a few deft snips, removed a couple of his

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.610
buttons and put them in my pocket.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.870
I then gave him two of mine in exchange.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.259
… The last I saw was one of my machine gunners,
who was a bit of an amateur hairdresser in

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:21.440
civil life, cutting the unnaturally long hair
of a docile Boche (German), who was patiently

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.800
kneeling on the ground whilst the automatic
clippers crept up the back of his neck.”

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.710
Those who were less enthusiastic about being
friendly with their enemy also took advantage

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.790
of this time, burying the dead and fortifying
their trenches without fear of being shot.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.669
However, even then the spirit of friendliness
seemed to be prevalent.

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:42.570
As one solder noted in a letter home, “I
honestly believe, that if I called on the

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.990
Saxons for fatigue parties to help with our
barbed wire, they would have come over and

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.080
done so.”

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.801
Many soldiers wrote similar accounts in letters
sent back home about the truce, but as this

00:05:51.801 --> 00:05:56.080
sort of behavior went against the massive
propaganda campaigns going on at home, trying

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.710
to stir the general populace up against the
“enemy”, the governments on both sides

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.380
suppressed these letters and kept them out
of the media for a short time.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.260
This ended when the New York Times published
a story on the event on December 31st.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.740
On January 1, 1915, The South Wales Echo also
published an account of the event, stating

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.979
“When the history of the war is written,
one of the episodes which chroniclers will

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:23.850
seize upon as one of its most surprising features
will undoubtedly be the manner in which the

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.660
foes celebrated Christmas.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:31.100
How they fraternized in each other’s trenches,
played football, rode races, held sing-songs,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.710
and scrupulously adhered to their unofficial
truce will certainly go down as one of the

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.789
greatest surprises of a surprising war.”

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:43.569
The next day the Daily Mirror even went so
far as to say that the only real wartime hostilities

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:47.819
that didn’t need to be forced were those
going on at home thanks to a “gospel of

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:52.160
hate” spread by the nation’s leaders (who
incidentally, once the cat was out of the

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.520
bag, tried extremely hard to downplay the
extent of the Christmas truce, in direct contradiction

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.360
to many of the soldier’s letters).

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.419
An excerpt from The Daily Mirror‘s article:
“The soldier’s heart rarely has any hatred

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:05.419
in it.

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:07.800
He goes out to fight because that is his job.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.700
What came before- the causes of the war and
the why and wherefore- bother him little.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.849
He fights for his country and against his
country’s enemies.

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:19.370
Collectively, they are to be condemned and
blown to pieces.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.770
Individually, he knows they’re not bad sorts…

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.020
The soldier has other things to think about…

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.910
Consequently, he has not time for rage, and
blind furies only overwhelm him when the blood

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.789
is up over fierce tussles in the heat of the
thing.

00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:34.580
At other times, the childishness is apparent
to him…

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.830
But now an end to the truce.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.039
The news, bad and good, begins again.

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:42.490
1915 darkens over.

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.759
Again we who watch have to mourn many of our
finest men.

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:47.050
The lull is finished.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:51.530
The absurdity and the tragedy renew themselves.”

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:55.370
Bonus Fact:
• About 17 million people were killed and

00:07:55.370 --> 00:08:11.919
another 20 million were injured as a result
of WWI.
