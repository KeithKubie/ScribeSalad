00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.870
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.780
CHRIS DALE: Welcome
to Talks at Google.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.160
My name is Chris Dale.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.860
It is my distinct
privilege today

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.590
to welcome the sound
engineering and project

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.329
team behind the release of
the new "Star Wars Ultimate

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:17.870
Collection" soundtrack.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.460
So what I thought I might do is
maybe turn it over to you guys

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.690
and let each of you
introduce yourselves

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.190
and talk a bit about what
your role is or has been

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.000
on this particular project.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.320
Maybe we start
with you, Patricia?

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.940
PAT SULLIVAN: I'm
Patricia Sullivan.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.220
I'm a mastering engineer.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:51.120
I work at a Bernie Grundman
Mastering in Hollywood.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:02.130
And for this project, I
resurrected Episodes II and III

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.560
for the CD.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:13.230
I did originally master
all of I, II, and III,

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:21.690
and then Episode I, I
remastered for the CD.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.990
And then I think those masters
got used for the vinyl.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.850
TOM LASKEY: Correct.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.750
PAT SULLIVAN: So that's
where I am with this.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.480
CHRIS DALE: Great.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.816
Dann.

00:01:35.816 --> 00:01:37.440
DANN THOMPSON: My
name's Dann Thompson.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.635
I'm a recording engineer
at Skywalker Sound

00:01:39.635 --> 00:01:40.860
in Marin County.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.170
And my part in this was
finding the original masters

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.030
for episodes IV, V,
and VI in the archives.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.450
And after finding them, I
did the digital transfers

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.740
that went off to be used to
make what's inside there.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.710
CHRIS DALE: Great.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.480
Tom?

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.990
TOM LASKEY: I'm
Tom Laskey, and I'm

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.940
part of the product development
team at Sony Masterworks.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:18.380
And my part of the project
was finding the audio,

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.030
sourcing the audio for
all six soundtracks,

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.140
and being a contact for Pat
and Dan, and with a lot of help

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.710
from Shawn.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.044
So he'll tell you about himself.

00:02:29.044 --> 00:02:29.918
CHRIS DALE: Terrific.

00:02:29.918 --> 00:02:31.400
And last, and
certainly not least--

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.610
SHAWN MURPHY: I'm Shawn Murphy.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.060
I recorded episodes
I, II, and III,

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.370
and had a pretty good idea of
what master material existed

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.820
when Tom called.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.070
And I tried to steer him
toward various people who

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.570
might be able to find these
masters, not an easy task.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.440
Because you think, especially
episodes I, II, and III,

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.610
they're so recent, this material
is going to be easy to come by.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.390
And it turns out it's
not so easy to come by--

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.230
and especially high resolution
master material, which

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.800
of course we would
like, for LP releases

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.290
and for future digital releases.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.170
So my part, aside from
engineering those three

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.030
soundtracks and the one
that we just finished,

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.530
was to try to unearth the master
material as much as possible,

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.815
which I knew about from
the previous episodes.

00:03:22.815 --> 00:03:23.565
CHRIS DALE: Great.

00:03:23.565 --> 00:03:24.850
Thank you.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.010
So the ultimate
soundtrack collection

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.400
comes in three different parts.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.220
There are 11 vinyl LPs.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.250
There are nine CDs that I think
also include a special DVD.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.380
And there's also the
high def version.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.930
Talk us through, why have
three different versions,

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.060
and was there some
thinking behind doing vinyl

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.860
specifically?

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.100
Vinyl for a lot of people,
particularly in the world

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.520
of tech, seems so old school.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.520
But I'm sure there's
a lot of value there.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.270
TOM LASKEY: Right.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.290
Well, vinyl right now is
the fastest growing format

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.160
in recordings, and
everybody wants vinyl.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.720
Well, not everybody, but a
lot of people want vinyl.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.100
So we thought this was
a fantastic opportunity

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.399
to create a really
deluxe kind of package

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:19.200
using state of the
art vinyl mastering

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.230
and that kind of thing and
using high resolution files.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.480
And a lot of this was
driven by the release

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.100
of the next episode, so the
timing was very good for that.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.880
And obviously, if you're
going to do vinyl,

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.540
you want to do all formats.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.590
The vinyl is actually special
because the original vinyl

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.650
releases of IV, V, and VI
are different than what

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.290
is currently available
on CD for those episodes.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.040
They were done with the
limitations of vinyl.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.540
Timing-wise, you can
only fit so much music

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.440
on one disk or two
disks or whatever.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.820
So there were some
editing decisions

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.130
made to accommodate vinyl.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.450
So we like the idea of
releasing the vinyl exactly

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.390
as it was released
back in the day.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.260
Putting them all
together as one set,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.630
that had never been done before.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.790
And the CD version that
we're coming out with,

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.570
that's actually a little
different than the LP version

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.670
for IV, V, and VI.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.990
That's the CD versions
that have been out

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.300
since, I think it
was '92 or something

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.410
like that or maybe a
little more recently,

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.100
those have additional material.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.640
And the high resolution
version, that's another thing.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.210
When you talk about
tech, everybody

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.290
wants high resolution.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.780
So we did that based
on the LP versions.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.820
So we wanted to offer
different formats

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.746
to attract as many different
listeners as we could.

00:05:52.746 --> 00:05:55.422
CHRIS DALE: Do you guys
have any favorites?

00:05:55.422 --> 00:05:57.172
Someone got an LP
player at home that they

00:05:57.172 --> 00:05:58.619
love to throw the vinyl on?

00:05:58.619 --> 00:05:59.660
PAT SULLIVAN: Shawn does.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.650
DANN THOMPSON: Shawn does.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.380
SHAWN MURPHY: Well, I've
got a lot of records still.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.510
Not to get into too
lengthy a discussion

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:13.320
of when we left off our analog
production and went to digital,

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.370
but there's a lot to be said for
a well-mastered, well-produced

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.100
analog vinyl version.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.910
And I do.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.700
I have a couple of turntables
at home that are nice ones.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.600
And I'm sure I'll have
a chance to listen

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.925
to these new issues on those.

00:06:28.925 --> 00:06:31.300
I play records all the time.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.690
CHRIS DALE: So Shawn, you've
worked on a ton of movies.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:35.940
You've won Academy Awards.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.260
You've won Emmys, Grammys.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.740
You've worked on "Braveheart,"
"Jurassic Park"--

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.980
the list goes on and on.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.180
How does working on
this particular project

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.240
differ from all these
other amazing movies

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.690
that you've worked
on in the past?

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.439
SHAWN MURPHY: Well, I
think the definition

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:54.550
is working on a John
Williams project, number one,

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.371
and working on "Star
Wars," number two.

00:06:56.371 --> 00:06:58.620
And I think what you have
to say about a John Williams

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.710
project is that first
and foremost, it's

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:06.390
all about the music
composition and performance.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.340
There's very little
production compared

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.559
to what a lot of other
composers ask for in terms

00:07:11.559 --> 00:07:12.600
of a John Williams score.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.730
He's a master composer.

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.220
He orchestrates
his own material.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.352
He usually conducts
his own material.

00:07:19.352 --> 00:07:20.810
And he gets the
performance that he

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.900
wants in the room at the time.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.330
So what our job is, is to get
a great recording of that,

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.990
and to make sure we have
all of the nuance, both

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.140
technically,
dramatically, emotionally,

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.290
that he intends in his music.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:39.280
So the big effort with
John is the performance.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.470
And we make multiple takes,
we edit things together,

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.050
but we don't do much in
the way of production.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.420
Many of the mixes
you hear are live.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.310
They're right off the stage.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.650
They're approved by him,
and we don't touch them,

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.110
because that's the balance
in the room that he chose.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.940
And I think that
was true originally

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.520
with Eric Tomlinson in Episodes
IV, V, and VI as well, I think.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.690
Eric made live mixes for
most of the material,

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:04.000
and John got the
performances that he wanted,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.567
and that's that.

00:08:05.567 --> 00:08:06.640
That's the end of it.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.550
So the difference between
a normal soundtrack

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.950
that we might produce these
days and a John Williams track

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.850
is that basically,
our approach with John

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.130
is very much all about the
music and the performance

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.980
and getting the best version
of that we can possibly

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.690
get in the recording world
without a lot of production,

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.664
other than editorial production.

00:08:27.664 --> 00:08:29.330
CHRIS DALE: In my
opinion, John Williams

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.450
is the definitive
composer of our time.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:35.164
I think he's just
done phenomenal work.

00:08:35.164 --> 00:08:37.330
Can you guys talk a little
bit more, maybe Patricia,

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.559
about working with
John Williams-- what

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:43.190
it's like, how precise is he.

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.850
Any one of you on
the panel, I would

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.390
love to hear some
personal anecdotes.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:50.420
PAT SULLIVAN:
Well, John's great.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:55.350
I think I've worked
with him for-- I

00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:03.360
set it right at 15 years, but
I think it's like 20 years.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.550
And he's great.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:13.980
You always have to
bring your A game.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:22.000
I think Shawn talked
about this at reddit about

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:31.570
that everything needs to
be at a certain quality.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:35.370
So you have to do well.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:45.420
And he's a great guy, and he
writes really great music.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:51.530
So you can't help but
want to bring your A game,

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.140
or even like an A+ game.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:10:00.420
The best that you can have
and even more, you will bring.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:06.410
So I always enjoy
working with him.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:12.790
I look forward to hearing
what he's written,

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:16.850
and I usually get blown away.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:23.090
And one thing about John
also-- from the CD world,

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:28.840
when the music gets
divorced from the film

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:33.570
and lives on its own,
John's very, very attuned

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:38.890
to having it be a
really great listen.

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.290
He doesn't want
you to get bored.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:49.530
If there's a dialogue
cue that tends to go on,

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:52.370
he'll just edit it.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:53.460
He'll be like, oh god.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:57.290
I've heard this again and
again, and it goes on too long.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:58.830
We've got to cut it.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:08.450
He's very attuned to
having the listener have

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:14.000
a good experience
with the music when

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.982
it's not married to the visual.

00:11:19.982 --> 00:11:21.190
CHRIS DALE: It's interesting.

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.160
Before I came down
here, a friend of mine

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.270
said to me she had
never seen the movies,

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.740
but she knew the song.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:27.615
She knew the sound.

00:11:27.615 --> 00:11:30.030
It just shows you how
iconic the sound has become.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:36.270
A quick question, I
think, for you day, Dann.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:40.035
As a hardcore "Star Wars" fan--
that's why I won the lottery

00:11:40.035 --> 00:11:41.560
and was able to
interview you folks,

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:47.030
obviously-- I appreciate
the passionate fan

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:51.750
base that gets worked up
around all sorts of things.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:55.220
I've got to imagine there's
a pretty, pretty fine line

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:59.150
you have to walk between the
hardcore, authentic, the way

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:03.250
it was scored, the way it
was produced back in '76, '77

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.400
is exactly the way it should
always sound versus the need

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.970
to really update the
music and the experience

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:11.150
for the 21st century.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:15.130
Can you talk a little bit about
trying to balance those forces,

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:18.970
particularly around
such a rapid group of--

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:20.965
DANN THOMPSON: You said
"forces," I didn't.

00:12:20.965 --> 00:12:23.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:24.710
Well, not being part
of the recording

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:28.370
process for the scores
where Shawn was,

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:36.130
a fan myself, I guess I've
always thought of the scores

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.950
as one of the
characters in the film.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:43.440
It stands alone,
and yet is part.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:48.140
And I think through all the
episodes, it's done just fine.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.750
Maybe Shawn could answer
that a little better than me,

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:57.120
but that's my take on it.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.181
SHAWN MURPHY: Well,
here's the thing.

00:12:59.181 --> 00:13:00.680
You have a group
of people who would

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.680
love to hear all
the cues complete,

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:08.240
multiple CD versions,
not a note left out.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.510
And you have to remember,
a lot of this music

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:13.250
was written for dialogue
scenes, to accompany action,

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:16.210
and it was never
meant to be played

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:17.770
by itself as a piece of music.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.630
But a lot of people enjoy
that because it's their hobby,

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:22.540
they're a fan, they like that.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.060
Understood.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.190
I think as Pat said, John's
attitude in the CD is to look

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:30.630
at it in a little more
of a normal person--

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:37.717
I say "normal person"--
listen, where the CD plays,

00:13:37.717 --> 00:13:39.300
it's sequenced through
and everything.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.550
It makes more sense musically
and doesn't waste time

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:45.260
by repeating phrases or
having a 30 second held note

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.996
while we're waiting
for dialogue to finish.

00:13:47.996 --> 00:13:49.870
Having said that, I
think there are arguments

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:52.620
for both versions,
and of course, it's

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.220
just a matter of money.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.390
It's a matter of time
and money to create

00:13:56.390 --> 00:14:01.010
a version of these scores
that is unfettered.

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:02.660
It's uncut, and it's
complete, and it

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:06.710
might represent multiple
CDs or a large download

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:12.157
at high res versus the version
that the other many thousands

00:14:12.157 --> 00:14:13.740
of people will like
because they don't

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.049
care about having every note.

00:14:15.049 --> 00:14:16.340
Which is right, which is wrong?

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.760
I don't think there's an answer.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.470
I can go into gory
blow-by-blow descriptions

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:25.850
of what exists on these
masters because I know.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:31.400
But truth be told, it's hard
to develop a complete uncut

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.090
version, because so
many of these cues

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:38.770
get placed to existing picture
quickly after they're recorded.

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:44.220
So do full and uncut versions
of the cues exist anywhere?

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.410
Sometimes no.

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:47.960
Sometimes the version is cut
so quickly that you never

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.630
have a complete
version of the cue that

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:52.180
hasn't been placed to picture
and been altered in some way.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.200
CHRIS DALE: Tom,
one of the things

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.190
that always surprises
me-- I remember

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.470
seeing an interview
where a lot of the cast

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.204
in the original "Star
Wars" just really

00:15:04.204 --> 00:15:06.370
didn't know the kind of
movie that they were making.

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:09.250
A lot of people in the
background on the production

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:12.470
crew were laughing
while they were filming.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:16.830
But when the lights went
down and the music started,

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.170
everybody in the audience,
including the cast members

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:21.253
who were there at the
premiere, realized that they

00:15:21.253 --> 00:15:22.800
were part of something special.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.570
To me, what's
fascinating is you have

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:29.610
this sort of orchestral,
symphonic sound,

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:33.360
but the context
is in the future.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:38.260
What do you think it is about
the songs, the sound that

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:42.070
makes "Star Wars" endure
as long as it's endured?

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:45.780
TOM LASKEY: Well, first thing
is it's really great music.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:49.360
I mean, it's really great.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.310
What I think-- and I think
I've read this in interviews

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:55.260
with John Williams--
that he was going

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.660
for that kind of old fashioned,
serial kind of sound.

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:02.050
If you watch "Flash Gordon,"
the TV show, black and white,

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:04.420
the theme music is
Liszt's "Les Preludes."

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:07.510
Well, that's a long way
from the 25th century.

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:11.590
So I think people
respond to that.

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:13.690
And a lot of those
old serials and stuff,

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:14.990
they have that kind of music.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:19.170
And one of the many brilliant
things about the music

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:22.310
is the way he's taken
that kind of feel and sort

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:24.710
of a, made it his own.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.730
Because there's
nothing else really

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.380
that sounds like "Star Wars."

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.230
It draws on all
kinds of influences,

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:32.610
but the music is unique to him.

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:37.410
And it also makes people think
of those old kind of serials.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:40.544
I don't know if younger
people now who don't have

00:16:40.544 --> 00:16:41.960
experience with
that, I don't know

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.168
if they respond the same way.

00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:46.130
But I know somebody
of my generation,

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.780
and I'm already a little young
for "Flash Gordon," although I

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:52.190
saw the reruns, I
responded the same way.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:54.350
Like, wow, this is great.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:57.280
It's got that familiar
feel, but yet it's different

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.052
and it's new all
at the same time.

00:17:00.052 --> 00:17:01.010
CHRIS DALE: We're here.

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.340
It's a Talk at Google,
but we're here at YouTube.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.030
And I ran into an
engineer who works

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:11.569
a lot on the sounds of YouTube,
and he was mentioning to me

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:15.839
that over half of our
traffic is mobile,

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:18.680
but the audio quality for
mobile is just so low.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.634
And so they always have
to kind of figure, what

00:17:21.634 --> 00:17:23.800
kind of audio range, what
sort of engineering things

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.970
do they have to do to make
a better user experience?

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:30.870
Are there formats-- we talked
about digital-- are there

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:34.000
formats or listening experiences
that some of these younger

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.330
generations have, their
consumption habits,

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.800
that goes into the thinking
when you're pulling something

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.120
like this together?

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.640
TOM LASKEY: Well,
probably not so much.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:49.990
I think we're trying to go for
the best sound that we can get.

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:54.240
And one of the whole big
things with mastered for iTunes

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:59.000
is to take the high
resolution and compress it

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.816
in ways that still reveal
all the details and as much

00:18:04.816 --> 00:18:06.190
of the sound
quality as possible,

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:11.260
but make it more
portable or whatever.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.170
So it's kind of the
best of both worlds.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:18.330
So it's practical for mobile,
let's say, but it still

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:22.640
has a lot more resolution
than the digital files

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:26.920
people were listening to even
10 years ago, the 128K MP3s.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:31.490
So that's really what
it's all about, I think.

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:34.005
Good sound is good sound,
no matter what age you are.

00:18:34.005 --> 00:18:36.370
CHRIS DALE: Do you guys
ever put virtual instruments

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:39.340
on top of any of this
stuff, or is it--

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.070
SHAWN MURPHY: Not with John.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.570
Yes.

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:43.260
Sure.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:47.700
Some composers actually compose
their scores with that in mind,

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.030
and they expect
you to use samples

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:53.990
and other synthesized
elements, or they

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:56.130
want to do some production
which would represent

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:57.400
that sort of approach.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.444
But not with John, no.

00:18:59.444 --> 00:19:01.110
John uses ethnic
instruments, of course.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.526
You listen to the "Harry Potter"
scores, some other scores

00:19:03.526 --> 00:19:07.390
we could note, where there are
ethnic instruments involved,

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:08.480
but they're played live.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:12.810
They're not sampled,
and it's not

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:16.010
to replace something
that is live.

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:20.490
Now having said that, on almost
every session, Star Wars I, II,

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:23.300
III, and VII, there
is a synthesizer.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.870
And it's there to either
create atmospheres

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:31.600
or to create a
certain type of sound.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.180
I think the cellist
in "Harry Potter"

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.900
is the best example of that.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:38.940
It's a synth cellist in
"Harry Potter" for every John

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.100
episode of that picture.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:45.030
It's just the sound that he
preferred because of the music

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:49.950
that he wrote, and the ability
to play it on a real instrument

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:53.810
was so limited that that wound
up being a better choice.

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:59.650
But it's not meant to replace
a violin or a trombone

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:00.670
or anything like that.

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:04.320
It's just a specific sound.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.990
CHRIS DALE: Dann, do you have
a moment in the production

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:09.424
process of this that
was just sort of a bang

00:20:09.424 --> 00:20:11.340
your head on the wall
moment where it was just

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.350
really difficult?

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:18.070
Any scars or trauma that
you want to share with us?

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:21.380
DANN THOMPSON: I think
what was the most difficult

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.740
was actually finding
the elements.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.860
The archives is a
big place, and some

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:35.320
of the earlier episodes, which
were the later episodes, just

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.080
harder to find.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:44.180
As time went on after
the albums were made--

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.764
multiple copies
of things get made

00:20:45.764 --> 00:20:48.180
because they go to different--
there's a European release.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.750
There's an American release.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.190
And so there's different
masters for things.

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:56.160
And so it took a little while to
sift through all those elements

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.626
to find the definitive ones.

00:20:58.626 --> 00:21:00.000
CHRIS DALE: From
start to finish,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.100
how long did this
process take [INAUDIBLE]?

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.497
TOM LASKEY: Once Shawn hooked
me up with Dan and Pat,

00:21:08.497 --> 00:21:09.330
it was pretty quick.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:12.700
It was a couple of
months, I think.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.870
And I know I can speak to what
Dann was just talking about,

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:17.290
finding the right masters.

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:20.420
I was in touch with
Leslie Ann Jones,

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.570
and she was giving me
sort of the play by play

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.250
of what Dann was finding.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.330
And one day I was like, oh no.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:28.580
We're not going to find these.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.121
And the next day I
was like, oh wait.

00:21:30.121 --> 00:21:31.285
Maybe they found them!

00:21:31.285 --> 00:21:33.160
And Dann said, well, we
might have a problem.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.570
No no, I can fix it.

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:37.540
So it was a lot of up and down.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.040
And of course, I'm telling
all of my colleagues.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.690
I'm relaying it to them.

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:46.260
So it's just magnified
exponentially.

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.360
So it felt like it went on
a lot longer than it did,

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.381
but we're really
happy with the result.

00:21:52.381 --> 00:21:54.880
CHRIS DALE: So we talked about
the three different versions.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.680
Do you guys feel like
anything gets lost when

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.470
you go from analog to digital?

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:02.300
I mean, that's a bit of
a Pandora's Box to open,

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:07.110
but I'd be curious to--

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.770
TOM LASKEY: I'll
let the pros answer.

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:10.270
DANN THOMPSON:
(WHISPERING) Silence.

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:12.200
SHAWN MURPHY: Well, yeah.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.770
The short answer is yes, sure.

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:14.510
Absolutely.

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:16.400
An analog master
converted to digital,

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.950
depending on the
gear that you use,

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.360
the sample rate that
you choose, and the care

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:26.030
with which you do it, can be a
pretty close replica or not so

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:27.550
close at all.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:33.720
And I think the topic of our
earliest digital transfers

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.310
and productions from
the late '70s to now

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:42.170
is the history of us abandoning
the sound of analog recording

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.100
and jumping into a digital
world that was not really

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.900
ready at that point for us
to be in it, to the point

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.940
now where we actually
have very high resolution

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.970
digital recordings
which are excellent,

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:55.210
and we can make a conversion
which is quite accurate.

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.170
And I think what
Dann did in terms

00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:59.779
of transferring his
analog masters is probably

00:22:59.779 --> 00:23:01.570
as close as you're
going to get to a really

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:07.597
high quality, 192 multibit
analog to digital transfer.

00:23:07.597 --> 00:23:08.680
But is there a difference?

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.780
Yes.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.230
Does it affect the quality
of the original material?

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:13.690
Yes.

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.280
Is it perfect, no.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.151
But it's better
than it used to be.

00:23:18.151 --> 00:23:20.400
CHRIS DALE: I think I have
time for one more question,

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:25.050
and then maybe I'll open
it up to our audience

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:29.870
for Q&amp;A. This will
be a softball, guys.

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:39.570
I'd love to hear what
orchestral moment, whether it's

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:46.050
the imperial walk, it's
the Leia and Han love song,

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:50.280
what cinematic moment sticks in
each of the back of your minds

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:54.780
that you could watch
time and time again?

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.690
And we start with you, Patricia.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:58.310
PAT SULLIVAN: Me?

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:03.480
Well, I love the
Han and Leia theme.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:09.350
That, to me, when I
heard it again recently,

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:10.620
it just gripped me.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:15.180
I just love that
little piece of music.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:27.080
As far as a visual
goes, in "Star Wars,"

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:36.560
in Episode I, when Qui Gon
is fighting the sith lord

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:47.540
with the double the lightsaber,
and then Obi Wan breaks through

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:54.040
and they do this
great little move,

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.420
I always wait for that move.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:59.110
I wait so I can see that.

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:05.420
So visually, that's like my
favorite moment of all six.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:10.930
Oh, and then of
course, in Episode IV,

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:14.020
when it opens up with the little
ship going by, and you're like,

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:14.640
oh my god!

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:18.510
And then the big old ship goes
by, and it's like, oh my god!

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:28.770
That one just blew my
little mind at the time.

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:29.977
CHRIS DALE: That's great.

00:25:29.977 --> 00:25:30.810
How about you, Dann?

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:33.978
DANN THOMPSON: You a fan, Pat?

00:25:33.978 --> 00:25:34.686
PAT SULLIVAN: No.

00:25:34.686 --> 00:25:35.186
Not at all.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.720
DANN THOMPSON: For me, it
would be the throne room scene.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.020
It's just so regal
with the brass,

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:49.930
and John is so good
at writing for brass.

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:51.200
It's uplifting.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.530
It gives me chills.

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:54.770
That's where I'm at.

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:57.238
That's what works for me.

00:25:57.238 --> 00:25:58.110
CHRIS DALE: Tom?

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:00.960
TOM LASKEY: Well, I have
to say it's in Episode VI,

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.800
the big confrontation
with Luke and the Emperor,

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:09.069
with Darth Vader all wounded
watching on the sidelines.

00:26:09.069 --> 00:26:10.610
And while all that's
going on, you've

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:13.750
got the big fight outside
with the Death Star

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:15.480
and all the fighter pilots.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.237
So it's like back and
forth with these--

00:26:18.237 --> 00:26:20.570
either one of those elements
would be amazing in itself,

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:22.530
but you've got both juxtaposed.

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.410
So it's just nonstop.

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:28.240
And the music could have
been really grating,

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:33.620
but somehow it all works to
maintain to this amazing climax

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.330
when Darth Vader finally
grabs the Emperor

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:39.950
and tosses him down the garbage
shoot or whatever it was.

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:42.664
It gives me chills every time.

00:26:42.664 --> 00:26:45.010
I'm not a fan.

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:48.330
SHAWN MURPHY: I think
that it's the downbeat.

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:53.330
The main title downbeat is
the electric moment for me.

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:56.290
And having recorded it many
times, both for the films

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:58.330
and in Boston and
other places, I

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:01.540
can tell you that the
musicians anticipate

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:05.656
that recording, that piece
more than almost any other.

00:27:05.656 --> 00:27:06.830
CHRIS DALE: That's great.

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:07.330
All right.

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:11.350
Well, why don't we open it
up to the audience, both here

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:14.420
and I know we have lots
of folks live streaming

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.420
from across the different
Google campuses.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.030
AUDIENCE: Do you have a
favorite way to listen to music,

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:23.820
like a different medium,
whether it's digitally now,

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.870
or do you still like
the old vinyls or CD?

00:27:29.342 --> 00:27:31.140
DANN THOMPSON: Eight track.

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.917
For me, it's digital,
whether it's streaming,

00:27:34.917 --> 00:27:36.000
depending on where I'm at.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.980
But I like to get a hold
of high res when I can.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:41.900
But at home between
the two favorites

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.800
speakers is my favorite place.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.900
PAT SULLIVAN: I think
my favorite place

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:50.420
to listen to music is at work.

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:55.180
I really like my speakers.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:28:00.680
I can hear a lot of detail.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:07.120
And too, it's fun when
I get to hear something

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:11.000
that's first
generation, something

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.930
that I haven't touched yet.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:16.790
Then it's kind of cool,
because there's not

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:19.300
a lot of people
that can hear that.

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:27.952
So I'd say my favorite
place to listen is at work.

00:28:27.952 --> 00:28:28.660
TOM LASKEY: Yeah.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.740
I guess I would
be more like Dann.

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.800
At home is really my favorite.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.310
I have a kind of
finicky system, and I

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:39.920
live in a prewar building, so
the wiring is a little iffy.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.590
So some days it's
better than others.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:44.210
But man, when I'm having
a good stereo day,

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:45.210
there's nothing like it.

00:28:47.665 --> 00:28:49.790
SHAWN MURPHY: Well, we
listen at work all the time,

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:53.780
and we have very good monitor
speakers that are tuned.

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:56.560
And we record most of
our original material

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.020
at a high sample rates nowadays.

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:01.320
And so fun to listen at work.

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:07.050
But at home, it's also fun to
listen to vinyl and to digital.

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:10.530
And more recently, I've started
to building a system at home

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:12.590
where I can listen to
these high resolution files

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:14.570
when I bring them
home so I can compare

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:16.570
what I've done at work
to what I've got at home.

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:20.070
Because the home
system is, in a way,

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:21.460
the psychological reference.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.780
It's what I listen
to a lot, and I

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.470
know that if it sounded good
at work, I bring it home,

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:29.750
it sounds good at home, I'm
probably in the ballpark

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:32.550
mixwise, sonically.

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:34.880
Unfortunately, this is
a ground breaker a bit,

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.794
because there haven't been
a lot of great LP releases

00:29:37.794 --> 00:29:40.210
that I've been able to get a
hold of and listen to lately.

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:46.509
But I've still got, I'm told,
way too many LPs at home

00:29:46.509 --> 00:29:48.300
that I pull out and
listen to all the time.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.910
So I have a nice system.

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:54.520
It's a Wilson audio system
that I listen to at home.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.459
So it's good.

00:29:57.459 --> 00:29:59.750
AUDIENCE: So since you deal
with high resolution audio,

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:02.270
at what point do you think
for human listening is

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:07.270
like the top end of sampling
rates and bit rates,

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:09.770
to the point where after that,
it's just diminishing returns

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:10.815
for most listeners?

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:15.810
SHAWN MURPHY: There's
a camp of people--

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:19.200
I don't want to usurp this
one-- but a lot of people

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.850
think 96k was the
best you could do.

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:24.490
And of course, Library of
Congress for a long time

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:27.640
created that standard, 96-24,
and archived a lot of material

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.920
in that standard.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.550
And we found when we
had 192 available, when

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:33.810
we made the comparison
to 190-224, that we

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:37.830
could hear the difference
and 190-224 was better.

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:41.090
And then we, a
couple of years ago,

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:45.100
got the ability to record
our mixes at 190-232 bit

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.500
and so we did the comparison.

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.521
Every time we do this, we do
A/B comparisons that are blind.

00:30:49.521 --> 00:30:51.520
And we did the comparison
again, and guess what?

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.330
190-232 was better.

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:58.650
And so are we talking about
a vanishingly small number

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:00.090
of people who can tell?

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:01.750
Yes.

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:04.230
But if I can tell,
that's all it takes

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:06.420
for me to want to do that.

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:07.997
So should we go higher?

00:31:07.997 --> 00:31:10.080
I guess the question is
should we be going higher,

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.920
and my answer is we probably
should be at some point,

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.570
as the technology allows.

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:18.400
We should probably be doing
some A/B tests and comparisons

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.690
at even higher sample rates to
see if we can get it better.

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:23.390
AUDIENCE: What kind
of details started

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:24.810
appearing more at that point?

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:26.900
SHAWN MURPHY: Well, it's
always a matter of space.

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:28.520
It's a matter space
between the notes.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.210
It's a matter of hearing
the recording venue.

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:32.335
It's a matter of hearing
the individual instruments

00:31:32.335 --> 00:31:35.800
in a placement that they were
actually live on the stage.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.770
It's a matter of
ambient retrieval.

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:40.350
It's a matter of accuracy.

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:42.970
I mean, obviously, a recording
is never a live performance.

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:44.170
It's never the same.

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:47.350
But you can have a version of
it that's pretty satisfying.

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:48.850
So it's all those things.

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:49.980
It's all those things.

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:53.590
And like I say, we don't
do this just gratuitously.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:56.150
We try to set up a very
good A/B comparison,

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:59.859
so we're actually hearing
a comparison that's valid,

00:31:59.859 --> 00:32:01.900
and not just something
where we say, oh it's 192.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:02.816
It's got to be better.

00:32:02.816 --> 00:32:04.360
There's no assumption there.

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.850
There's no assumption.

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:07.350
AUDIENCE: I was
just wondering-- you

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:10.907
mentioned taking the masters
home and listening to them.

00:32:10.907 --> 00:32:12.490
I know I've done
production of my own,

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:14.220
and they sound great
on my speakers,

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:15.650
and then I go listen in
my car, my headphones,

00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:17.300
and I can hardly
even recognize it.

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:21.040
I've heard stories of mastering
engineers trying mastering even

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.350
on TV speakers and
different kinds of setups

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:24.510
just to see how it sounds.

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:25.840
Is that something
you guys do at all,

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.590
or do you just trust
your own setup enough

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:29.400
that it sounds
good in there, you

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.810
trust that it'll
sound good anywhere?

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:37.750
PAT SULLIVAN: Well, at
times, I'll listen in my car

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:40.980
because it's crappy
in my car, and so

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:44.440
to just know what
kind of characters

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:47.840
are being brought out in my car.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:55.430
And then at times, I'll
listen on a crappy computer

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:58.660
to see what that sounds like.

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:04.800
But I basically listen
to what I have at work,

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:08.050
because I feel that if I can
get a good sound there, then

00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:14.140
it should translate
to other places.

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:23.940
And then, too, I do make my
clients do all of that, too.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:27.410
I make them listen in
their car and listen

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:31.840
in a really good space and
listen in a crappy space,

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:37.510
just so they can get an idea too
of what they're listening to,

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:45.390
and that different environments
drastically change the sound.

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:48.860
And I think that they
really need to know that.

00:33:52.179 --> 00:33:54.220
AUDIENCE: So one thing I
was wondering about was,

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:56.132
you talked about
tracking down the masters

00:33:56.132 --> 00:33:57.090
in the archive earlier.

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:01.140
I was just really curious how
they were stored and preserved,

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:03.740
the masters.

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:06.600
DANN THOMPSON: The archives
building at Skywalker

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.810
is the climate controlled.

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:12.210
And there's a section
for the audiotapes,

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:15.670
and they're lined up by episode.

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:18.010
So they were there,
although again, there

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:20.940
were multiple copies of
things with different dates.

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:25.679
And so trying to find
the exact ones to use

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:27.790
took some time and
a little research

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:31.650
on when things were
recorded, things like that.

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:37.040
Jokingly, I think I
found one of the reels

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.670
leaning up against this crate
that said "Ark of the Covenant"

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:41.650
on it.

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:44.290
No, it wasn't really
there, but it's

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:46.447
nice to think of it that way.

00:34:46.447 --> 00:34:48.780
SHAWN MURPHY: Well, the thing
you have to remember, too,

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.446
is there are a lot
of different masters.

00:34:50.446 --> 00:34:52.840
Dann found stereo masters
for IV, V, and VI,

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.940
which were original LP masters.

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:58.420
But there are film masters, and
there are various iterations

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:03.000
of film masters-- original
scoring masters, dub units,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.440
final print masters on
film are now on Pro Tools

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.420
or whatever the format was.

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:14.160
And a lot of those masters
are in boxes not in the vault.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:17.040
They are in the salt mines,
or they're stored away

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.590
someplace where, who knows?

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:22.130
We'll probably have to
open 1,000 cardboard

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:25.780
boxes to find all of it.

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:29.930
And a lot of that material
is our best existing version

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:32.820
of these scores.

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:35.540
Because especially in the
early years in Episodes IV, V,

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:38.580
and VI, we don't have
existing multi-track masters

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:39.840
of all that material.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.260
We do have mixed masters.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:43.670
And again, like I say,
Eric Tomlinson, like I,

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:44.470
did live mixes.

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:46.354
So you have a good
representation

00:35:46.354 --> 00:35:47.770
in Eric's mixes
of what was there.

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:50.840
But those are on mag film, and
they were used for dubbing,

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.960
and they were in a box in
the salt mine someplace

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.520
that Dann never found, and I
certainly have never found.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:02.090
And we know they exist, but
it's a bit of a train wreck

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:05.110
to know what we've
got and where it is.

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:06.580
So it's a good question.

00:36:08.557 --> 00:36:10.890
TOM LASKEY: Well, let me just
say also part of the issue

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:14.160
too is that the
ownership of the music

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.300
has changed hands many times.

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:21.250
So you never really know
when Company B purchases

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:23.160
from Company A, are
they really getting

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.870
everything that Company A had?

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:29.174
And then there's company
C, and Company-- it's

00:36:29.174 --> 00:36:30.590
tough to keep track
of that stuff.

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:35.880
And that's true of so many
projects in recordings.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.790
The real masters and
the multi-tracks and all

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:39.740
that, they're just
scattered all over.

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:43.220
AUDIENCE: I've noticed
in the last several years

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:45.610
that more and more
orchestras are hosting events

00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:51.500
where they'll show a film
while playing the soundtrack.

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.150
And my experience
has been that I

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.690
thought that the
orchestral sound would

00:36:56.690 --> 00:37:00.760
become constantly more prominent
throughout the entire showing.

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.350
But I found that
actually, there'd

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:05.289
be times in watching
the film that even

00:37:05.289 --> 00:37:07.830
though the orchestra's playing
the whole time, even sometimes

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:12.050
quite loudly, it just
sort of fit with the film,

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:13.550
and sometimes it
would pop back out,

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:15.010
sort of a necker cube effect.

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:18.200
I wonder if you had any
thoughts about this kind

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:24.010
of entertainment, and
also what your experiences

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:26.686
watching a movie, how
does the sound come in

00:37:26.686 --> 00:37:29.130
and out in your consciousness?

00:37:32.067 --> 00:37:34.525
SHAWN MURPHY: Well, I can give
you the short history of it.

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:40.580
For years, there were
versions of musical pictures,

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:42.510
"Sound of Music,"
"Wizard of Oz,"

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:45.630
around where they would extract
the dialogue and sound effects

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:47.464
and they would play
the orchestra live.

00:37:47.464 --> 00:37:49.130
Sometimes they would
do it episodically.

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:50.963
Sometimes they would
play the whole picture.

00:37:50.963 --> 00:37:52.910
These things have been
around for a while.

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:57.000
But the modern film with
the orchestra playing

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.650
live was really
started in about 2002,

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:03.190
when we did a live performance
of "E.T." at the Shrine

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:04.410
Auditorium.

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:06.460
It was the 20th
anniversary of "E.T."

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:09.470
And this was John Williams
conducting an orchestra,

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:13.210
end to end, nonstop, with
all of the music resurrected

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:15.710
and placed in the film
exactly as it was.

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:18.220
And if you know the Shrine
Auditorium in Los Angeles,

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:20.340
you know it's a large
venue, and the orchestra's

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:21.280
got to be amplified.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.905
And of course, the
dialogue and effects

00:38:22.905 --> 00:38:24.580
had to be amplified as well.

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:25.730
It was very successful.

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:28.660
And what came out of that
was this whole movement

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:32.230
toward building dialogue
and effects tracks

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:33.734
with an orchestra playing live.

00:38:33.734 --> 00:38:35.150
But what you have
to understand is

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:39.380
it's so venue-dependent
and so operator-dependent

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:42.995
that the mix you get is
going to be very haphazard.

00:38:42.995 --> 00:38:44.870
It's not going to be
consistent, and it's not

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:46.370
going to be necessarily
accomplished

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:49.839
by persons who really
know how it should sound.

00:38:49.839 --> 00:38:51.380
If it's a concert
hall, you might not

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:53.320
need to amplify the
orchestra at all.

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:56.212
If it's a large venues such
as the Shrine, 6,000 seats,

00:38:56.212 --> 00:38:57.670
it might need a
lot of application.

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:59.410
It could be anywhere in between.

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:03.720
And you have to, at some
point, assume the competence

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.700
of the person that's making the
balance, which may or may not

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.200
be high.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.347
So I think that
what's happened is--

00:39:10.347 --> 00:39:11.930
we've seen "Back to
the Future," we've

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:15.880
seen "Home Alone,"
the ones I think

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:18.370
that you're talking about.

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:20.720
It runs the gamut of
quality between really,

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.189
really good and
really substandard,

00:39:22.189 --> 00:39:23.730
and I think there's
no way of knowing

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:26.490
how it's going to be
because it is so venue

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:28.600
and operator dependent.

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:29.730
It's an entertainment.

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:32.540
The orchestras find that these
things make a lot of money,

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:36.890
and so they are programming
these events more and more.

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:39.706
And I work for some
orchestras that do that.

00:39:39.706 --> 00:39:40.830
It's a moneymaker for them.

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:43.770
And anything that makes money
for a classical orchestra,

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:44.450
I'm for.

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:45.990
Right.

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:48.939
But the quality is an issue,
and I think your point is well

00:39:48.939 --> 00:39:50.230
taken that it's not consistent.

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:57.590
AUDIENCE: Thank you
guys for being here.

00:39:57.590 --> 00:40:03.029
So what inspired you early on
to get into music as a career,

00:40:03.029 --> 00:40:04.195
and what keeps you inspired?

00:40:07.792 --> 00:40:08.500
PAT SULLIVAN: Me?

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.270
DANN THOMPSON: Start with you.

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:12.210
PAT SULLIVAN: Start with me.

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:16.240
Well, I played guitar.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:21.720
I played accordion
when I was younger.

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.340
I was in a band.

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:28.450
We played rock and
blues for beer.

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:31.650
And it was fun, and
I really loved it.

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:38.860
And music moves me.

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:44.380
And when I realized that I
wasn't such a good player,

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:51.620
but I could hear that
magic, I could hear it,

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:54.330
so I wanted to be close to it.

00:40:54.330 --> 00:41:00.200
So I was able to find a way
by being on the technical side

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:00.790
of things.

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:09.720
So I could still help
a project be born.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:19.340
At times I joke and say that I'm
a musical midwife, because I'm

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:24.420
like at the end of the chain,
and I'm yelling at the client

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:28.640
to push, to get the baby out.

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:31.640
And so I can be part of that.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:37.685
I can help them
shape their sound,

00:41:37.685 --> 00:41:50.030
and dot all the I's and
cross the T's, and help them

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:55.644
give their music to the world.

00:41:55.644 --> 00:41:57.435
DANN THOMPSON: That's
a hard one to follow.

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:03.300
I grew up with
music in the house,

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:07.530
so it was always a
soundtrack in the background.

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:10.340
And I guess maybe I should
think about it more,

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:13.740
but it could even
have been after seeing

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:16.320
"Star Wars" with such a
wonderful score behind it that

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:20.820
pulled you into the film
that I started playing music

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:24.215
in the background of
the things that I did.

00:42:24.215 --> 00:42:26.201
I have to mow the
lawn, and my room

00:42:26.201 --> 00:42:27.450
was in the front of the house.

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:30.090
And I'd just shove my
speaker in the window,

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:33.680
and I'd crank up Rossini.

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:37.430
I would play stuff, and it
would just blare down the block.

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:41.534
But my folks seemed
to support it.

00:42:41.534 --> 00:42:42.950
I just wanted to
be part of music,

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:44.783
but I never really
wanted to be a performer.

00:42:44.783 --> 00:42:46.660
It wasn't my bag.

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:55.950
So I looked to be part of the
chain, and I found a spot.

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:59.180
It's one of the
best places to be,

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:03.390
to observe these
wonderful artisans,

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:07.110
and she says, birth their
art and be part of that

00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:12.680
and to help them along their
way as it gets to mastering.

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:16.280
It's pretty incredible.

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.260
TOM LASKEY: Well, I also grew
up in a house with music.

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:24.430
My mom was a big classical music
fan, so there was always music.

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:26.470
And she was also
into records, too.

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:30.135
She taught me the difference
between the different labels,

00:43:30.135 --> 00:43:32.430
and I grew up with that.

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:34.360
I wasn't very good
at sports or anything

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:38.570
like that, but somehow,
music, I was much better at.

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:40.780
And I learned how
to play the oboe,

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:45.120
and I actually went off to
music school to do that.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:48.990
But earning a living that
way is kind of difficult,

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:51.700
or it certainly seemed
that way for me.

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:54.532
So I sort of
gravitated, naturally,

00:43:54.532 --> 00:43:55.490
to the record business.

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:59.950
I worked in a record store, when
there still were record stores,

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:04.030
and just sort ended up
in the music business.

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:04.970
And I just love it.

00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:11.090
Music for me is everything.

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:12.140
It's my religion.

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:13.360
It's everything.

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.530
And there's nothing in
the world, almost, that

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:17.800
moves me the way music does.

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.970
So I'm just thrilled to
be around it all day.

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:23.590
And working on a project
like this, where I still

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:26.450
have vivid memories of going
to see the first episode

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:28.800
and not really
knowing much about it,

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.860
and then just being
totally blown away.

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:36.050
And working with somebody like
John Williams, who I discovered

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:40.530
from his concert works, not
really his soundtrack music,

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:44.240
and then found out later,
it's just really a thrill.

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:47.510
And working with all
the different details,

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:49.680
the packaging details
and the graphics

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:55.300
and all that, there's endless
creative opportunities.

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:57.240
So that's what keeps me going.

00:44:59.197 --> 00:45:01.030
SHAWN MURPHY: Well,
it's always about trying

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:04.430
to find a job that encompasses
things you love to do

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:07.160
and things you're good at.

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:10.120
So if you love music and
you love things technical,

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:14.244
you travel down a path that
diverts you several times.

00:45:14.244 --> 00:45:16.160
But ultimately you wind
up in a job like this.

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.780
I'm very fortunate
to have a job that's

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:20.910
technically interesting
and musically interesting,

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:24.890
and I get to work with
great people all the time.

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:28.240
So it just wound up being
an accumulation of a lot

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:29.660
of experience and time.

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.989
And from having a
music background--

00:45:31.989 --> 00:45:33.780
I was a brass player
for awhile, but again,

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:36.240
never good enough to
make a living at it--

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:40.240
but an appreciation of music,
and an appreciation of things

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:46.322
technical, and combining
that to make a nice time.

00:45:46.322 --> 00:45:47.700
CHRIS DALE: That's great.

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:50.530
I think we're going to
have to wrap up now,

00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:52.450
but I would be
remiss if I did not

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:56.010
ask one final question, which
is the elephant in the room.

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:58.010
Episode VII.

00:45:58.010 --> 00:45:59.562
Should we be excited?

00:45:59.562 --> 00:46:00.270
PAT SULLIVAN: No.

00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:01.680
Not at all.

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:02.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:03.140
Boring.

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:03.390
Boring.

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:03.890
Boring.

00:46:05.916 --> 00:46:07.540
DANN THOMPSON: There's
another episode?

00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:13.885
SHAWN MURPHY:
Well, I've seen it.

00:46:13.885 --> 00:46:14.385
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:14.385 --> 00:46:15.135
CHRIS DALE: Uh oh.

00:46:15.135 --> 00:46:18.360
Now that's a whole bunch of
other follow up questions.

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.640
SHAWN MURPHY: But out of order.

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.924
We score out of order.

00:46:22.924 --> 00:46:23.840
CHRIS DALE: All right.

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.460
Well, I'll take
that as validation

00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:29.140
for my ticket purchase six
months ago, whenever it was.

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:29.640
OK.

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:32.970
So I think right now, one
thing we do great at at YouTube

00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:34.930
is unboxing and unboxing videos.

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:38.537
So we have one of the
collections, a vinyl

00:46:38.537 --> 00:46:40.120
collection, right
here in front of us.

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:42.407
So maybe if we could do a
bit of an unboxing here,

00:46:42.407 --> 00:46:43.990
I think that would
be terrific to take

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:45.760
a look at what's inside.

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.685
DANN THOMPSON: It's
your baby, Tom.

00:46:47.685 --> 00:46:49.647
SHAWN MURPHY: It's Tom's box.

00:46:49.647 --> 00:46:51.230
TOM LASKEY: This has
a lot of parents.

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:52.180
I'm just one.

00:46:54.757 --> 00:46:55.590
PAT SULLIVAN: Ready?

00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:58.320
SHAWN MURPHY: Take
the water off.

00:46:58.320 --> 00:46:59.450
PAT SULLIVAN: There we go.

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:02.766
TOM LASKEY: We start off, brand
new quote from John Williams.

00:47:02.766 --> 00:47:05.760
John Williams' signature.

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:08.700
And so we can start--

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:10.450
DANN THOMPSON: Better
get the order right.

00:47:10.450 --> 00:47:15.740
TOM LASKEY: --Episode
I. Episode II.

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:16.890
Episode III.

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.240
Here's Episode IV.

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:22.739
Now, let's take a
look because there

00:47:22.739 --> 00:47:26.220
are extra goodies in
here, one of which

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:29.085
is this poster, which was
part of the original package.

00:47:34.344 --> 00:47:35.510
CHRIS DALE: We'll edit that.

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:37.260
TOM LASKEY: OK.

00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:37.890
OK.

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:41.090
Well, this one goes
in the detective bin.

00:47:41.090 --> 00:47:42.470
Let's see, what else?

00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:44.740
We have these
lovely images here.

00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:46.800
Yeah yeah yeah, I know
about the t-shirt.

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.763
Coming right up.

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:52.010
Now we were talking about this.

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:53.530
This is really neat
because it's got

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:55.820
the roster of the orchestra.

00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:58.550
So all the musicians who
played on this episode,

00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:00.360
they're all listed here.

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:01.160
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.190
They're all listed here.

00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:09.415
And it's a blow by blow.

00:48:09.415 --> 00:48:11.530
Maybe the t-shirt's
in the other one.

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:13.511
Maybe we left it
at-- well, anyway.

00:48:13.511 --> 00:48:14.010
Oh no.

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:15.510
Here it is.

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:16.090
OK.

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:18.620
So this was also from
the original package.

00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:23.220
So you could send away and
get a "Star Wars" t-shirt.

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:25.160
Sorry to say, that
offer has expired.

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.860
PAT SULLIVAN: Aw.

00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:27.800
Really?

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:32.120
TOM LASKEY: These all have
very nice centerfolds too.

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:33.800
Gatefolds.

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:34.550
Here you go.

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:36.155
It's an alternate covers here.

00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:46.070
Back to sequence, here.

00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:49.680
And then Episode V had
this really cool booklet

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:53.470
stitched into the-- wait,
hold it over there, right?

00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:58.371
OK, so you've got your scary
imperial walkers there.

00:48:58.371 --> 00:48:59.640
We've got all this jazz here.

00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:07.970
Nice Billy Dee Williams.

00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:08.490
OK.

00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:12.050
Luke, I am your father.

00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:14.680
And then all this stuff.

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:17.720
And Episode VI,
which is only one LP.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:21.172
That's the way it was
released, so that's all we got.

00:49:21.172 --> 00:49:22.380
CHRIS DALE: That's fantastic.

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:23.490
TOM LASKEY: Pretty nice, huh?

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:23.990
CHRIS DALE: Great.

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.490
All right.

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:27.320
Well, join me in thanking
our guests for coming.

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:29.940
Patricia, Dann, Tom,
Shawn, thank you so much.

00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:32.990
[APPLAUSE]
