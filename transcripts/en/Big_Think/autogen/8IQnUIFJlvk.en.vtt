00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.330
I'd be very surprised that we're not

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:12.340
I'd be very surprised that we're not
 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.650
I'd be very surprised that we're not
looking at unemployment rate over ten

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660
looking at unemployment rate over ten
 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.480
looking at unemployment rate over ten
percent by the end of the year and quite

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490
percent by the end of the year and quite
 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.610
percent by the end of the year and quite
likely crossing eleven percent sometime

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:17.620
likely crossing eleven percent sometime
 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.820
likely crossing eleven percent sometime
next year in a good case scenario we'll

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830
next year in a good case scenario we'll
 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.019
next year in a good case scenario we'll
start to see the unemployment rate

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:22.029
start to see the unemployment rate
 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.140
start to see the unemployment rate
coming down in 2010 but it's still it's

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150
coming down in 2010 but it's still it's
 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.580
coming down in 2010 but it's still it's
still like they'd be in double digits by

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590
still like they'd be in double digits by
 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.890
still like they'd be in double digits by
the end of 2010 but that's that's what's

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900
the end of 2010 but that's that's what's
 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.870
the end of 2010 but that's that's what's
really front and center now how long

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880
really front and center now how long
 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.790
really front and center now how long
does it take us to get back to a more

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800
does it take us to get back to a more
 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.290
does it take us to get back to a more
normal unemployment rate that's going to

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300
normal unemployment rate that's going to
 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.540
normal unemployment rate that's going to
depend a huge amount of policy I think

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550
depend a huge amount of policy I think
 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.820
depend a huge amount of policy I think
we very badly need another stimulus

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830
we very badly need another stimulus
 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.160
we very badly need another stimulus
probably even larger than the last round

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170
probably even larger than the last round
 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.290
probably even larger than the last round
at this point there's little political

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300
at this point there's little political
 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.149
at this point there's little political
will in Congress and certainly the Obama

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:45.159
will in Congress and certainly the Obama
 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.040
will in Congress and certainly the Obama
administration to take the lead on that

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050
administration to take the lead on that
 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.310
administration to take the lead on that
but my hope is that as the economy

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320
but my hope is that as the economy
 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.020
but my hope is that as the economy
continues to deteriorate I don't hope

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030
continues to deteriorate I don't hope
 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.399
continues to deteriorate I don't hope
that continues to deteriorate but as

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409
that continues to deteriorate but as
 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:54.869
that continues to deteriorate but as
that will happen I think it will only

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879
that will happen I think it will only
 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.119
that will happen I think it will only
delay in two ways about it that you will

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129
delay in two ways about it that you will
 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.250
delay in two ways about it that you will
see more pressure on Congress to do

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260
see more pressure on Congress to do
 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.350
see more pressure on Congress to do
something about it so that by the summer

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360
something about it so that by the summer
 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.119
something about it so that by the summer
you do have people talking about another

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129
you do have people talking about another
 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.300
you do have people talking about another
round of stimulus so if that happens we

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310
round of stimulus so if that happens we
 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.980
round of stimulus so if that happens we
do get a big boost the economy then they

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990
do get a big boost the economy then they
 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.270
do get a big boost the economy then they
come and could start to recover more

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280
come and could start to recover more
 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.820
come and could start to recover more
quickly and perhaps next scenario we

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830
quickly and perhaps next scenario we
 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.500
quickly and perhaps next scenario we
will see the unemployment rate under ten

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510
will see the unemployment rate under ten
 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.250
will see the unemployment rate under ten
percent by the end of two thousand
