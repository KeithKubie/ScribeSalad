00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.660
The next few lessons will cover internet routing.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.810
Contrary to what you might think, the internet

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.550
is not a single network, but rather a

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.610
collection of tens of thousands of independently operated networks,

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.630
or autonomous systems. Sometimes simply called AS's. Networks

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.240
such as Comcast, Georgia Tech, and Google, are different

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.060
types of autononomous systems. An autononous system might

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.620
be internet service provider, a content provider, a campus

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.940
network or any other independently operated network. Now

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.580
when you're sitting at home on Comcast and

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.860
trying to reach content in Google or Georgia

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.710
Tech, your traffic actually traverses multiple autonomous systems. This

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.010
process of internet routing actually involves two distinct

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.890
types of routing. One is intradomain routing, which is

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.870
the process by which traffic is routed inside

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.490
any single autonomous system. The other is interdomain routing,

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.140
which is the process of routing traffic between

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.130
autonomous systems. So computing a path between a node

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.170
in an ISP like Comcast and another node

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.790
in a network like Georgia Tech's involves computation of

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.380
both intradomain paths and interdomain paths. In this

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.190
part of the lesson we'll look at intradomain routing.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.380
Then we'll study interdomain routing, as well as

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.360
the business relationships that make interdomain routing so complicated.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.790
So let's jump into our study of intradomain routing and topology.
