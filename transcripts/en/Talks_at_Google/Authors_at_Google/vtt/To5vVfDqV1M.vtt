STEVE HINDY: Thank you
all for coming today.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.770
I suppose this is not a bad
way to spend the afternoon

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.180
at Google, having
a couple of beers

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:20.010
and listening to me talk
about my book a little.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.970
So what I'm going to
do is outline for you

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.170
the book hopefully talking about
some interesting stories that

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.470
are in the book.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.295
I want to say upfront that I am
the founder of the co-founder

00:00:39.295 --> 00:00:43.040
of the Brooklyn
Brewery since 1988.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.000
And the reason I think I'm
qualified to write such a book

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.810
is I've gotten to know
most of the pioneers

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.110
and founders of the whole
craft beer movement.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.730
And I've been involved
in it pretty intimately

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.860
from the beginning through
our association, the Brewer's

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.370
Association.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.940
And like many of my generation
of craft brewery, people

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.020
who started in the
1980s, I had a career

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.990
before I got into
the beer business.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.540
I was a journalist.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.130
I graduated from college
in the early '70s.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.280
I had a degree in English, and
I tried teaching high school

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.230
and almost had a
nervous breakdown.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.390
It was the hardest thing
I ever did in my life,

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.240
teaching senior English
to the bright class

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.350
and the dumb class.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.260
Both of them were
terrifying for me.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.200
I was never the most
well behaved student.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.440
And as a teacher it seemed
like every day was payback

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.240
for the way I treated my
teachers back in the day.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.230
So I realized I couldn't teach.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.890
And so I got a job at the
newspaper in upstate New York,

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.700
and I worked for small
newspapers for a couple years.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.190
And I got my big chance job
with the Associated Press

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.480
in Newark, New Jersey in 1976.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.120
And for reasons I usually go
into after I've had about four

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.220
beers, I got in my head
I wanted to cover a war.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.190
And if you work for
AP you can do that.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.704
So I started studying Arabic and
said, I want to go to Beirut.

00:02:35.704 --> 00:02:37.620
And I learned there
aren't too many people who

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.920
want to go to Beirut
and cover wars.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.230
So like a year
after I volunteered,

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.100
I landed in Beirut as the Middle
East correspondent for AP.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.880
That was February, '79 when
the shah was being overthrown

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.680
in Iran and Ayatollah
Khomeini was coming to power.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.330
So I went to Iran and
covered the tail end

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.760
of the revolution and
the hostage crisis.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.270
I know many of you
are very young.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.620
But you know the movie, "Argo?"

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.000
It's that period.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.370
So I was in Iran for that.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.130
I got thrown out of Iran
eventually by the government.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.610
I went back into Iran the
next year with the Iraqi army

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.650
when they invaded Iran.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.030
I covered that war
from the Iraqi side.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.240
And I don't know if any
of you served in Iraq.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.620
But if you know anything about
working with the Iraqi army,

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.390
it's pretty exciting.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.480
I lived in Beirut.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.100
In Beirut we had the
civil war ongoing.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.270
And eventually the
Israeli invasion, the

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.640
massacres in the refugee
camps, Sabra and Shatila.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.640
I covered those stories.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.700
Moved to Cairo, and I was
sitting behind President Sadat

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.320
when he was killed at
the parade in 1981.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.450
So I covered a lot
of big stories.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.380
It was actually
pretty good training

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.390
for starting a
brewery in Brooklyn.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.570
I'm not kidding.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.680
But when I was in Cairo,
I met American diplomats

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.810
who had worked in Saudi Arabia.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.800
They had three year
postings in Saudi Arabia.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.660
And Saudi Arabia has
pretty strict prohibition

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.860
on alcoholic beverages.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.550
So these guys were
avid home brewers.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.700
They'd gotten into
home brewing in Saudi,

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.720
and they continued in Egypt
because the beer in Egypt

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.020
was not very good.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.440
It was reputed to have a little
dose of formaldehyde in it

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.030
as a preservative.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.390
And you could feel
your lips getting

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.530
a little numb after the first
few sips of Egyptian beer.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.190
So these guys made
home brewed beer.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.160
And then my wife, who was with
me through not the whole thing,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.170
but much of my years
in the Middle East,

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.530
we had our first child.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.160
Actually, Sam was born
in Beirut during the war.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.860
Lily, our daughter,
was born in Cairo.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.640
And AP wanted me to
go to the Philippines

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.950
next because President
Marcos was in trouble.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.820
And I was a conflict
reporter, that's what I did.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.260
I was really excited about this.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.320
And my wife said, no.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.050
I'm not taking the kids
to the Philippines.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.940
I'm going back to New York.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.310
I hope you come with me.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.590
But if not, have a nice life.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.010
So I gave it up and
came back to New York

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.720
and went to work for News Day
doing foreign news for Newsday,

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.370
living in Brooklyn and making
beer at home, home brewing.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.680
And eventually with my
downstairs neighbor,

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.295
Tom Potter, who was a
young guy with an MBA

00:05:43.295 --> 00:05:46.270
who'd always wanted to
start his own business,

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.580
I convinced him that it was
not a completely lunatic thing

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.810
to try to start a brewery.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.040
And we started Brooklyn Brewery.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.760
That was 1988 when we
sold our first beer.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.910
I count myself among
what I call in the book,

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.940
the first generation
of craft brewers.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.450
And that's different
than the pioneers.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:17.020
The pioneers I describe
as a period from 1965

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:23.400
when Fritz Maytag from the
Maytag washing machine fortune,

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.650
bought an old failing brewery in
San Francisco called the Anchor

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.370
Brewing Company and brought
back Anchor Steam beer, which

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.870
was a particular kind of beer,
a lager beer actually brewed

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.680
at warmer temperatures
like an ale

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.100
to produce this special
style called steam.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.690
And a lot of
different explanations

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.470
of where steam came from had
to do with the era of steam

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:57.230
engines or when you tap the keg
you got a little puff of steam

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.960
off the beer.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.680
But you get that off any beer.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.440
But anyway, enough of that.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:10.040
So Fritz was the first
guy to bring back

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.880
traditionally brewed beer.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:18.060
So 100$ Malta barley, no rice
or corn like the big brewers.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:23.090
And he was alone in
this pursuit until 1978.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.230
And there was a guy
named Jack McAuliffe who

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.200
had been in the US
Navy based in Scotland.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.990
He was a submariner.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.270
And he got into home brewing
when he was in Scotland.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:40.380
And in England, that was in UK,
that was the era of real ale

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.400
and the campaign for real
ale which was a movement

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.590
to preserve the traditional
style of brewing and serving

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.800
ale in England.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:57.910
So Jack is a real entrepreneur,
a very quirky personality.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:02.240
Jack started New Albion
Brewery in Sonoma.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.120
And that was really the
first home built brewery.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.120
So it was made out of
cobbled together parts.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.930
Soda, Pepsi tanks,
and dairy tanks

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.400
and all that sort of thing.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.400
And actually, his two
partners were Jane Zimmerman,

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:26.070
and I'm spacing on the
name of the second one.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.190
But it was two women.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:31.310
And they were intimately
involved in brewing the beer.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.120
Actually one of them was
intimately involved with Jack,

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.590
but that's a different story.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:41.450
But they made the first
beer, New Albian Ale.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:46.300
And Susie Dennison
was the second woman.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.740
They made New Albian Ale.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:53.190
And that was really kind of
the first built from the ground

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:56.010
up brewery, very different
than Fritz Maytag

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.061
who-- I always
felt Fritz was kind

00:08:58.061 --> 00:08:59.810
of playing with a
different sheet of music

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:03.390
than the rest of us, because
he had a fortune behind him.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:08.680
Jack did not, but that only
lasted about six years.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:14.310
But it had a huge impact
on several important people

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.880
like Ken Grossman
from Sierra Nevada,

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.910
Paul Shipman from Red Hook.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.680
Actually, I was
talking to John Hall

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.980
from Goose Island
in Chicago recently,

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:28.120
and he told me he
visited New Albian also.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.450
So a lot of people who were
home brewing at that time

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:33.310
kind of flocked to
New Albian and were

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:41.300
inspired from what Jack and
his partners were doing.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.380
Actually, I remember Ken
Grossman saying something

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.700
like, you know,
what Jack was doing

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.810
was just kind of a glorified
home brewing operation.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:55.030
So Ken started his
brewery in Chico

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:59.000
in a garage basically
cobbling things together

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.360
the same way Jack had done.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:10.490
And it was a period
of struggling

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:14.170
to sell this stuff
because nobody

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.050
knew what craft beer was.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.680
It was called
microbrewed beer then.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.160
Actually, that term
microbrewery came

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.840
from a guy who was working
for Charlie Papazian.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.050
And Charley Papazian is the
founder of the Great American

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:35.085
Beer Festival and "Zymurgy"
magazine-- how many of you

00:10:35.085 --> 00:10:36.636
are home brewers, by the way?

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:42.200
Oh shit, you know all
this stuff, right?

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:46.780
Well, stop me if I'm
get too detailed here.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.700
But actually, there
was a guy working

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:53.490
for Charlie who was
a software engineer.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:58.010
And he coined the
term, "microbrewery."

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:02.405
He basically said to Charlie
at one point, these people

00:11:02.405 --> 00:11:04.030
starting these small
breweries, they're

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.190
kind of like microprocessors.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.000
These are microbreweries.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.470
And that's where
that term came from.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.550
And it endured
for quite a while.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.910
Today, we call a
microbrewery a brewery

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:20.770
that's making fewer than
15,000 barrels a year.

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:24.100
And actually, it's a
very fast growing segment

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:28.880
of craft beer now in America.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.600
Fritz talks about the early
days about how difficult it

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.180
was to sell the
beer because people

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.980
just didn't understand
what he was doing.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.210
They thought he was crazy.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:41.130
They thought he was from
Mars or something like that.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:48.760
And he talked about how they
had to dump a lot of beer.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.622
Because they would
brew the beer,

00:11:50.622 --> 00:11:52.330
but they couldn't sell
it quickly enough.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:56.210
And it would go bad, so they'd
have to dump it down the sewer.

00:11:56.210 --> 00:12:00.800
And that's a very painful
thing for any brewer to do,

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.070
I can tell you.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:06.940
There is an interesting
story about Red Hook which

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.570
I think illustrates a
lot of the way things

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.240
were back with the pioneers.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.490
Red Hook Brewery
in Seattle, started

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:20.580
by Paul Shipman who
was a wine salesman.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.240
Shipman was
determined that he was

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.990
going to brew really
original beer.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:28.580
So he didn't want to
use any brewer's yeast

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:33.480
from any of the institutions
that catalog different yeast,

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.670
so he got a yeast
from a professor

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:39.040
at the University of Washington,
and they made Red Hook Ale.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.200
And they set a date
for the opening

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.070
of the brewery in
Seattle at a pub.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:48.620
And a few days
before the opening

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:53.310
they realized the beer really
didn't taste very good.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:55.540
It was off.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.480
But they had
committed to the date

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.320
and it had been in the press.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.170
So they forged ahead.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:05.780
They had the big day with the
mayor, and all the politicians,

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.040
and a lot of dignitaries.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.600
They tapped the keg,
they poured the beer.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.920
Everyone tasted the
beer and kind of looked

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:17.380
at each other like, oh
yeah, this is great.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.910
But they knew it really wasn't.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:25.520
And leave it to the journalist--
there was a reporter there

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.720
from the Seattle newspaper
who wrote what everyone was

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.920
thinking which is, this
tastes likes rotten bananas.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.390
This is not the
way it should be.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:40.050
But Shipman, like
any entrepreneur,

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:41.660
was very determined.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.440
And he forged ahead
with this beer.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.070
And for about a year
they kind of limped along

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:50.350
selling this beer that people
were excited about because they

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:53.590
loved the idea of a local
brewery there in Seattle.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:55.830
But they all knew it
didn't taste very good.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.300
And the feedback they were
getting from their customers

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.030
was people order
one pint of this,

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:02.820
then they kind of
drink half of it.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:07.730
Then they order Coors
Light for the next beer.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.790
But Shipman was determined.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:12.180
So Michael Jackson came to town.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:17.250
And I hope, I'm sure as home
brewers, you all know who,

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.754
which Michael Jackson
I'm talking about here.

00:14:19.754 --> 00:14:21.170
I'm talking about
the British beer

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:24.490
writer who was incredibly
influential for their craft

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:28.690
beer movement in America
and all over the world,

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:29.380
for that matter.

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:35.770
His "1977 World Guide to
Beer" made experts of myself

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:38.630
and many of you, I'm sure.

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:41.820
Michael did incredible
research into brewing,

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:46.700
and visited virtually every
brewery on the planet.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:50.780
And Michael never said anything
bad about any craft brewery.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:54.300
He was the total supporter
of the movement in the US.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:58.500
So he came to Seattle and
he tasted the Red Hook Beer.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.060
And of course, there
was great anticipation.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:05.540
This is Michael Jackson
tasting my beer.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.390
So Michael swirled it around.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:12.650
And he said, this is kind
of like a Belgian beer.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:17.620
And Shipman, the ultimate
salesman said, exactly Michael.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.120
It's a Belgian style beer.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.250
So they changed all
the copy on their label

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:28.740
to say it's a Belgian style
beer and all the marketing copy.

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:33.580
It's like, we've got this
great Belgian style beer.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.880
But still, the stuff
was not selling well.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.670
Then another guy came to
town who actually turned out

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:42.790
to be a very important man
in the history of craft beer,

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:44.210
named Joe Owades.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:49.320
Joe Owades is a brewing
chemist who-- he died,

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.730
I think last year--
most famous for-- he's

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.650
the father of light beer.

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:59.980
He created diet beer at the
Rheingold Brewery in Brooklyn,

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.350
I think in the '60s.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:04.850
And the marketing
geniuses at Rheingold

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:08.020
named the beer
"Gablingers," which

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:11.860
is not the most appetizing
name for a beer.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.540
And it totally flopped.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:20.670
It wasn't until Miller
Lite in the '70s and '80s

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:23.680
got into marketing light
beer that light beer really

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.230
took off.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:25.940
But Joe was the
guy who created it.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.960
And he's a brewing chemist.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.850
A very natty dresser
with a pencil

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:40.020
mustache, very German, very
blunt, and iconoclastic.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.270
So Owades came to Seattle.

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:47.600
And at the time, he
was teaching brewing

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.440
at Anchor in San Francisco.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.890
He had a program there.

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:55.150
So he came to Seattle and
he tasted the Red Hook Ale.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.690
And he turned to Paul
Shipman and said,

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:02.650
is this made for some
unusual ethnic group

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:05.780
here in Seattle or something?

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:09.790
And Shipman, the ultimate
salesman, is like, no Joe.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.319
This is our Belgian style ale.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:18.079
And Owades looks at him
and says no, it's not.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.859
It's infected.

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:22.079
Let me show you
how to make beer.

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:24.010
And he advised them
on a yeast to buy

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:26.840
from a Siebel
Institute in Chicago.

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.970
And they changed the yeast.

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:33.510
They renamed the beer "Ballard
Bitter," and Red Hook took off.

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:37.360
I love that story because
it kind of describes

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.820
what it was like being a
pioneer with this whole thing

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:44.100
and trying to do
something original

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:47.320
and failing, but
pushing ahead with it,

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.390
and eventually, figuring it out.

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:54.450
Also, the involvement
of Michael Jackson.

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:59.070
Michael was so important in this
whole craft beer revolution.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:02.020
We did many, many
events with Michael

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:05.760
here in New York in the '80s.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:10.140
And he did so much to
educate people about beer

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:14.020
and laid the groundwork
for this whole thing.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:19.545
And Owades, Owades eventually
consulted for many, many craft

00:18:19.545 --> 00:18:23.830
brewers, including us
at Brooklyn Brewery.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:27.830
He actually wrote the recipe
for Sam Adams Boston Lager.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:32.470
It was based on Jim Koch's
family, his grandfather's

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:33.520
recipe.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.045
But Joe was the guy who
actually put it together.

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:40.960
I think he worked at Sierra.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.190
He worked at many breweries
over there as a consultant

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:48.880
because he was a real expert,
really interesting guy.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:55.300
I was at a dinner at
Anchor several years ago

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:59.360
that Fritz Maytag threw, and
I was sitting next to Joe

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.040
on my left.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.080
On my right was Gary Fish
from Deschutes Brewery.

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:08.800
And Gary's one of my closest
friends in the beer business.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:13.030
And Gary's flagship brand
was Black Butte Porter,

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:15.450
which of course-- a dark beer.

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:18.160
And I knew that Joe
didn't like dark beer.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:23.500
But I said Joe, you've got
to try Gary's porter here.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.470
And Joe said, I don't
care for dark beer.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:27.520
And I said, I know.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.580
But Joe, this is Gary's
number one brand.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:34.660
This is his flagship
there in Oregon.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.630
And Owades looked
at me and said, yes,

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.695
and some people
like burnt toast.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:47.670
You can't make up
these characters.

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:52.230
So my generation were
inspired by the likes

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:57.870
of Sierra Nevada, and Red
Hook, and these breweries

00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:58.789
mostly out west.

00:19:58.789 --> 00:20:00.330
There were only a
couple in the east.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.475
There was Newman's Albany
Amber up in Albany.

00:20:03.475 --> 00:20:06.380
I don't know if any
of you remember that.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:07.410
One of you does.

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:08.450
Yeah.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:12.770
Bill Newman made incredible
beer, just fantastic beer.

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:19.250
But I swear, he couldn't
sell water to a starving man.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.490
He was a terrible salesman.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:24.800
Then here in New York City
there was Matthew Reich

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:31.050
with New Amsterdam, a beer that
was actually also created along

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:32.400
with Joe Owades.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.280
And New Amsterdam was
the first, actually

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.330
they were way ahead of
everybody back in the '80s.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:40.860
Way ahead of Sam Adams,
way ahead of everyone.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:45.180
And Matthew was the guy who
started contract brewing,

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.160
the concept of contract brewing.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.435
He made his beer at
the Utica Brewery

00:20:49.435 --> 00:20:55.030
up in Utica, New York where
we actually started out too.

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.790
When I started with
Brooklyn Brewery,

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:00.210
there was a reporter from
Manhattan Ink magazine

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:01.680
that called up Matthew.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.400
And by this time he had
built an incredible brewery

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.970
on 11th Avenue and 26th
Street in the city,

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:09.890
and the reporter
asked Matthew what

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:12.630
he thought of this
Brooklyn Brewery project.

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:16.300
And Matthew said, I hope those
guys fall flat on their faces.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:20.390
They've stolen every idea I
ever had, which is kind of true.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.010
We all learned from the
people who came before us.

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:28.960
That's the way the
whole thing got built.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:34.630
And Jim Koch with Sam Adams
learned a lot from Matthew.

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:37.120
And Jim of course,
contract brewed

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.000
at the beginning of
his company also.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.170
And that was the way it
was back in the '80s.

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:53.830
We all were kind of focused on
making all malt beer and pretty

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:56.190
traditional styles
like an amber ale,

00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:02.340
an amber lager, a porter,
a stout, often promoting

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:05.260
the idea that we're making
bitter by the Reinheitsgebot,

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.930
the German purity
law, only using

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:12.020
the four basic
ingredients of beer.

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.690
And those were sort
of the hallmarks

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:19.850
of my generation starting out.

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:29.230
The '90s were just a
crazy time for craft beer.

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:33.270
A lot of money came in,
a lot of venture capital.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:34.940
It was the dot com years.

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.650
A lot of venture capital came
into the brewing industry

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:40.920
as well as the tech industry.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:47.430
There were like six or seven
companies that went public.

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:49.600
Only one of them
really succeeded

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.550
and that's Boston
Beer, Sam Adams.

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:55.670
All the others in
one way or another

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:58.360
screwed up as public companies.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:04.670
And I think the reasons were
that they were too small.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:07.640
They were too young
really to be committing

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.410
to the kind of
reporting that you have

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:15.010
to do as a public company
and the demands of the market

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:17.330
once you're a public company.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:21.360
So the only one that
succeeded was Sam Adams.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:27.530
The big brewers started
to aggressively attack

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:30.530
craft breweries
including-- Anheuser-Busch

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:34.080
really went after Sam
Adams in a big way

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.780
in the '90s with television
ads calling them out

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:41.630
for making contract
brewed beer and saying

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:45.150
they're fake breweries, they
don't really have breweries.

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:47.930
So a lot of stuff happened.

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:51.600
A lot of those ones
that went public tanked.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:55.000
And the growth of
craft beer really

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.740
slowed down in the mid '90s.

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:02.150
And the press
basically was saying

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:05.890
this whole microbrewed
beer thing is over.

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:07.440
And a lot of people bought it.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.630
Actually, a lot
of craft brewers,

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:13.680
if you talk to them about the
'90s, will say the same thing.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:20.290
The interesting thing I
uncovered in writing this book

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:25.730
is that far from a
time of retrenchment,

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:29.050
the craft brewing
movement really

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:34.000
laid the groundwork for the
next explosion of craft beer

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.170
during that period.

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:38.780
Between '94 and I
think 2000, there

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.350
were like 1,000
breweries started.

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:46.610
And it was a period of
incredible innovation.

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:49.940
New Belgium Brewery
in Colorado started up

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.680
making only Belgian style beers.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.970
Allagash up in Maine
started up, Stone

00:24:55.970 --> 00:25:01.680
in San Diego, Russian
River in California,

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:05.490
Dog Fish in Delaware.

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:09.640
And these were all very
creative, very inventive,

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:14.070
very innovative
brewers and breweries.

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:18.100
Garrett Oliver
joined us in 1994.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.390
And the first beer he
did for Brooklyn brewery

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:23.116
was Brooklyn Black
Chocolate Stout.

00:25:23.116 --> 00:25:25.740
Garrett had been the founder of
the New York City Home Brewer's

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:26.239
Guild.

00:25:26.239 --> 00:25:28.890
I met in 1986.

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:30.670
He was working for big law firm.

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:33.790
He quit and went to work
for Manhattan Brewery, which

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:36.850
was the first brew
pub in the city.

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:38.410
And he learned to brew there.

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:41.430
Manhattan Brewery failed
under three different owners.

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:45.900
It was like the second owner
was dumber than the first owner,

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.550
and the third was
the dumbest of all.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:50.760
They had great beer, they
had a great location.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.270
But they just couldn't
put it all together.

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:56.404
And it really was poor
leadership, I think.

00:25:56.404 --> 00:25:57.820
But Garrett learned
to brew there.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.110
He joined us.

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:02.300
And actually, they
were in bankruptcy

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:05.780
when Garrett brewed the first
Brooklyn Black Chocolate

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:09.910
Stout at the Manhattan
Brewery, and no one

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:11.960
was paying any attention
to what he was doing.

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.930
He had the grain
and he could do it.

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:16.520
And Garrett talks about
that as his resume

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.300
for Brooklyn Brewery.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.860
So that was the
first beer for us.

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:26.175
The second Garrett did was
Brooklyn East India Pale

00:26:26.175 --> 00:26:31.870
Ale, which is a very balanced
IPA which of course, it's still

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:35.240
one of our big
selling our brands.

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:40.150
And that eventually led
to the Belgian style

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:44.990
beers that we make and the wheat
beers, and the incredible range

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:49.180
that we now produce in Brooklyn.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:54.260
So when people talk about
the '90s, craft beer almost

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:57.840
disappeared, they're really
wrong because there was so much

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:02.460
new energy coming into
the craft beer world.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:08.270
At that time that you just
can't understate how important

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:10.870
the '90s were for
laying the groundwork

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:15.640
for the future of craft beer.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.060
So I don't buy
the shakeout idea.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.280
There were some
spectacular failures.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:25.840
Pete's Wicked Ale went like
this, to 400,000 barrels,

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:29.200
and then went down almost
as quickly as it came up.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.810
Catamount, up in
Vermont, which was

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:35.740
one of the pioneer, one of
the my generation of brewers,

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:36.850
failed.

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:41.880
They built a second brewery
and did not continue to grow,

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.500
so they had taken a lot of debt
to build that second brewery.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:50.240
They didn't grow, so they
got squeezed had to sell.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:54.030
Actually, Harpoon in Boston
bought the Catamount Brewery

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:56.960
back then.

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:00.510
And then there
were several things

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:04.870
that happened that
really supercharged

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:06.960
the whole movement.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:10.630
In the last five
years, craft beer

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:15.510
has grown at a very
vigorous double digit pace.

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:21.790
Brooklyn Brewery has
actually grown at 25% pace.

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:31.690
In 2008 we sold 75,000
barrels of beer.

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:35.830
Last year we sold
220,000 barrels.

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:39.300
So we tripled during
that five year period.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.795
And the same as happened to
a lot of craft breweries.

00:28:42.795 --> 00:28:48.290
There were several reasons
why that happened, I think.

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:51.930
Number one was the distributors.

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:56.380
The big distributors in America
opened up to craft beer.

00:28:56.380 --> 00:29:00.970
For many years the only
choices we had as craft brewers

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:03.190
when we're sell--
well, Brooklyn, we

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:05.220
distributed our own
beer for 15 years

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.750
because none of the big
distributors in New York City

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:09.020
were interested in us.

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:13.660
And believe me, I had no love
of running a trucking company

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:14.570
in New York City.

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:18.300
But we kind of have to do it.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.070
And the only choice we
had going into new markets

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:24.800
was the Miller distributor,
or the Coors distributor,

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:31.900
or a wine distributor for whom
beer is like second class,

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:36.310
or a craft beer distributor of
which there weren't too many.

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:37.950
We were one.

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:43.170
And we knew because we were one
that craft beer distributors

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:47.750
didn't have the
capital to make it go.

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:50.520
And the whole
Anheuser-Busch network

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:54.400
of distributors,
for the most part

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.890
only carried
Anheuser-Busch products.

00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:01.390
So that's like 50% of the
US market of distribution,

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:02.790
is Anheuser-Busch.

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:08.350
And we had no access to
that distribution network.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:11.780
In the '90s, August
Bush declared

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:15.430
a policy of 100% share of mind.

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:20.860
So he said to his distributors,
if you only sell AB products,

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.600
I will give you
financial incentives,

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.970
and I'll make you rich.

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:28.630
Which he did actually,
and most of them

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:31.770
stuck to the 100% share of mind.

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:36.140
But that all fell apart
in the last 10 years

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:42.620
as craft beer began to grow and
mainstream beer began to lag.

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:46.260
And the Anheuser-Busch network
opened up to craft beer.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:50.450
So it used to be when
we go into a new market,

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:53.280
we would prepare
this big presentation

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.320
and go to a distributor
and tell them

00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.380
how we were going to sell the
beer, Brooklyn beer for them,

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:04.900
how we were going to make
them rich by putting salesmen

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.580
in their market,
doing promotions.

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:11.470
So basically we were trying
to sell ourselves to them.

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:13.860
After Anheuser-Busch,
distributors

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:15.490
opened up to craft beer.

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:19.380
Suddenly, I had competition
between the Miller-Coors people

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:22.220
and the Anheuser-Busch,
and the wine guys.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:25.060
And now when we go
into a new market

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.860
the distributors
are presenting to us

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:29.350
and telling us
what they're going

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:32.950
to do for us if we pick
them for that market.

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:36.530
So it's hard to describe
how important that was.

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:39.910
There's still a lot of
problems between craft brewers

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:42.880
and distributors,
don't get me wrong.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:47.870
But that's been very important
for the surge of craft beer

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:50.050
in the last 10 years.

00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:52.750
Another big thing,
and I probably

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:56.080
don't have to tell you
all this, is social media

00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:00.670
has been so important
for craft brewers.

00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:04.080
Daniel Bradford, who's
the editor, the publisher

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.970
of "All About Beer" magazine,
he was the publisher

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:10.880
of "Zymurgy," the home brew
magazine back in the '80s.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:13.680
And Daniel told me
back then he did

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:18.440
a survey of all the
readers of "Zymurgy."

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:24.110
And he found that 80%
of them had PCs at home.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:26.390
And this was in the '80s.

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:31.350
Computers weren't
so common back then.

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:36.310
But home brewers were
definitely computer savvy.

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:41.770
And that whole
splintering of the media

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:44.650
and the emergence
of social media

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:48.470
has been absolutely
critical for craft brewers.

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:51.740
And it's been a big problem
for the big brewers.

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:56.010
For years they were able
to lock up the US market

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:59.820
by their domination of the
three big television networks.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:04.900
But all that is gone,
it doesn't work anymore.

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:08.070
And the big guys haven't
really figured out

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:10.720
how to communicate
in this new world.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.420
And it kind of
shows in and what's

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:13.910
happening with their sales too.

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:17.390
They've lost an
incredible volume

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:19.930
of sales in the last five years.

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:21.820
At the end of this
year I think it'll

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:25.650
be about 20 million
barrels, which is about 10%

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:28.400
of the whole US beer market.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.720
And during that
same time, craft has

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:34.540
been on this tear,
growing double digits

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:37.500
the whole segment.

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:42.120
So you can't overstate the
importance of social media.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.910
You can start a
little brewery today.

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:47.890
And people are doing this
in the middle of nowhere.

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:52.760
And the beer drinkers
will know more about you

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:57.430
than maybe you know about
yourself because they're

00:33:57.430 --> 00:34:01.630
so into this and following
what's happening.

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:04.650
It's really quite amazing.

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:07.650
And this is happening
all over the world.

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:10.600
There are craft
breweries opening up

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.380
in a lot of places
around the world

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:16.130
because many-- the world
is hooked on light lager

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:21.580
beer the way America
was for many years.

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:28.130
And another important thing--
and it's hard to overstate this

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:33.040
too-- is our association,
the Brewer's Association,

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.600
you'll hear a lot of people
say that craft brewers are

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.440
really collegial.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:40.179
That they cooperate
with each other,

00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:44.420
that they work with
each other, that it's

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:48.290
kind of this unusual
situation where competitors

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:52.199
get together and work together
to build the category.

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:53.850
But it's really true.

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:58.180
And I attribute it to two
thing-- the Great American Beer

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.800
Festival and the Craft
Brewer's Conference.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:05.260
It brings us
together every year.

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:10.630
And I have friends, brewer
friends all over the country.

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:13.010
We come together, we
talk about our problems.

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:18.660
We talk about experiences,
we trade war stories.

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:23.420
And I've learned so much
from people like Gary Fish

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:27.950
at Deschutes or Kim Jordan
at New Belgium, another one

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:31.160
of my really close friends.

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:36.280
It really is a very collegial
atmosphere in craft beer.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.950
Even here in New
York City, there

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:42.030
are 23 craft breweries
in New York City now.

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:45.600
Actually, I wrote a
piece for "Cranes" which

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:50.020
is going to come out in
September about all the craft

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:51.870
breweries in New York.

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:54.980
New York has been very
unfriendly to craft beer.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:36:00.920
We were really the only ones to
succeed in the '80s and '90s.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.940
There were about
20 or 30 startups

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:08.110
that failed during that
period in New York City, brew

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:10.815
pubs and craft breweries.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.550
So the BA, the
Brewer's Association,

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:20.770
has been an incredible force
and power for craft brewers.

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:25.490
We now have a significant
clout in Washington

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:28.320
with the federal government,
we're a regulated industry.

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.790
You've got to be involved
in politics if you're

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:33.050
going to be in
the beer business,

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:35.510
and in every state government.

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:40.910
Home brewing actually is
legal now in 50 states.

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:45.170
I think Alabama was the last
one to legalize home brewing.

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:48.743
And that was through the efforts
of the Brewer's Association.

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:54.520
Today, you have
what I would call

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.640
the third generation
of craft brewers.

00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.790
And back in the
'80s when we used

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:03.520
to go to the Craft Brewer's
Conference every year,

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:07.050
there might be 200
people or 300 people.

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:11.380
And back then it was like god,
there are 300 people here!

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:15.030
This year at the Craft
Brewer's Conference in Denver,

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:17.660
there were 10,000 people.

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:22.480
I had to work to find my
friends in the crowds.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.250
It was quite amazing.

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:28.090
And the startups today,
unlike my generation

00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:34.110
where we all had jobs and
careers before we started

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:37.160
breweries, these are young
people coming right out

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:40.010
of college with business
degrees or brewing

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:43.380
degrees who are going
right into this industry.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:46.590
And it's a very
attractive industry.

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:48.430
It's a lot of fun.

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:50.740
It pays pretty well
now, a lot better

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.800
than it did when I started out.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:58.920
When I started out sort of
taking a page from the tech

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:03.350
industry, we would
offer stock options

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:06.280
to people joining
Brooklyn Brewery

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.490
Because I mean I
was paying myself

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:11.820
$24,000 when we started in 1988.

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:15.650
And I had been making more
than twice that as a journalist

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:18.350
even back in the day.

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:21.120
But today, you could
make a good living

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:22.860
in the craft beer industry.

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:25.940
And actually, if you
get to a certain level

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:29.520
you can actually make
quite a bit of money.

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.950
So things have really changed.

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:40.160
And this third generation,
it's a mix of everything

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.630
that came before it.

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:44.240
You have all different
kind of business models.

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:50.030
And one of the people
I profile is this guy

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:53.030
with Kodiak Island
Brewing Company.

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:55.890
Kodiak Island is off
the coast of Alaska

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:57.830
over toward the Aleutians.

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:03.220
There are more bears on Kodiak
Island then there are people.

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:06.270
But this guy, Ben
Millstein and his wife

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:08.170
started this little brewery.

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:11.690
I think they're like 20,000
people on the island.

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:13.580
And their little
brewery has become

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:18.383
the center of social
life on that island.

00:39:18.383 --> 00:39:22.980
The two senators from Alaska
have visited Kodiak island

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:25.830
to talk about how
great the brewery is.

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:27.880
And actually,
that's something I'm

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.280
very proud about with
Brooklyn Brewery.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:33.650
And I think all the craft
breweries across the country

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:37.210
have had very positive
impacts on the communities

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:40.640
where they've started
because most of us

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:43.040
are very deeply involved
in the communities

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.570
where we're making beer.

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:46.760
If you're the person
making the beer

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:50.950
you have an interesting kind
of status in a community.

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:53.080
And it's something
I didn't really

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:56.520
understand until I
started doing it.

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.350
We don't do any advertising.

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:03.930
We do a little bit with "Edible"
and a few niche publications.

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:08.320
But mainly, we give away beer
to not for profit organizations

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.230
and causes we believe in.

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:13.520
And that's how I got
involved-- yeah, right, Mike.

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:17.720
That's how I got involved with
transportation alternatives,

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.170
and Prospect Park.

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:24.000
We give money to
literally hundreds

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.530
of organizations every year.

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:28.090
Beer and/or money.

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:30.220
And that's the way
we promote ourselves.

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:32.710
We do the same
thing in Stockholm

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:36.740
where we sell a lot of beer,
or London, or Columbus, Ohio.

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:40.630
We do this thing we
call the Brooklyn Mash.

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:44.240
It's a cultural festival
we do in 12 cities.

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:48.150
And it really celebrates
the creative culture

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:51.010
of the cities where
we're doing the events.

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:59.180
So we do food events, beer
events, comedy, literature,

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:00.600
music.

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:05.160
And all of it
using local talent.

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:09.160
We actually usually bring
a comedian from New York

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.640
to be part of the thing.

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:16.030
But it's mainly, it's kind of a
craft beer way of selling beer.

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:21.310
And actually, the
forward to my book

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:23.030
Is written by John Hickenlooper.

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:29.930
John started the Wynkoop
Brewery in Denver in 1988,

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:32.100
same year I started
Brooklyn Brewery.

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:35.620
Wynkoop was started
in Lower Down Town.

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:37.120
It was called LoDo.

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:40.000
And it was the
first sign of life

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.150
down in the LoDo for years.

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:45.590
That was like a
warehouse district

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:49.490
actually exactly like where
we started in Brooklyn

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:52.480
in the late 80s.

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:57.520
John eventually ran
for mayor of Denver

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.280
and became mayor of Denver.

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.305
And then he ran for
governor of Colorado,

00:42:01.305 --> 00:42:04.180
and he's now
governor of Colorado.

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:08.330
So believe me, I have
no interest in politics.

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:10.660
But it's interesting
how he parlayed

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:15.660
his sort of revival of Denver
into a political career.

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:17.550
And actually, there's
been talk of him

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:20.130
being a vice
presidential candidate.

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:24.500
Colorado's a swing state
and he's a very liberal guy.

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:27.690
So don't be surprised if
he doesn't get paired up

00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:32.040
with Hilary down the road here.

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:36.370
Also this new
generation, they're

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:40.340
following the same playbook
when it comes to marketing

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:45.080
and community involvement,
and all that kind of thing.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:48.670
They're making all different
crazy kind of beers.

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:53.780
The styles that are being
explored are quite amazing.

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:57.380
I think Ninkasi
Brewery in Oregon

00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:01.660
just sent some yeast
into outer space

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:04.590
as part of the space shuttle.

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:06.480
I'm not sure that's
really going to go

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:09.090
anywhere except up and down.

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:15.910
But the other day I did a
Reddit thing for two hours.

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:19.360
And I responded to 231 people.

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.580
And my favorite was
a guy from Brazil

00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:24.640
who asked me if I had
tried the new beer made

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:27.470
with ants from Brazil.

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:33.200
And I told him I had not, and
I wasn't really eager to try.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:37.540
There's a beer in
Iceland that is

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:42.810
made with malt that has
been smoked with sheep dung

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:46.670
because they don't have
too many trees in Iceland.

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:49.690
And actually, it's a
really good tasting beer.

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:57.710
And I couldn't really detect any
animal character to the beer.

00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:02.170
And of course, Sam Calagione
has done incredible beers

00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:05.860
based on ancient
Egypt and Babylon.

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:12.620
And beer's just an incredible,
wonderful, inexpensive

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:13.460
beverage.

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:16.620
And a lot of people
say to me, aren't you

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:23.270
guys kind of turning beer into
a snob beverage like wine?

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:25.900
And the answer is, no.

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:29.280
You can have the best beers
in the world in your cellar.

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:33.770
They're all accessible to you.

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:38.760
Whereas wine, the
CEOs of big companies

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:43.980
have cellars that no one
can even imagine owning.

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:50.560
So wine is a whole different
category than beer.

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.460
Let's see, have I
talked too long?

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:54.600
Yeah?

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.960
I'd be happy to answer
any questions you have.

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:00.110
A lot of people ask me
about the future of beer.

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:03.920
And I just want
to say that there

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:06.410
are 3,000 breweries
now in America.

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:09.270
When I started there
were fewer than 50.

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:14.150
There are 2000 breweries
in planning right now.

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:19.350
And I believe that America can
easily absorb 5,000 breweries.

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:23.150
Before prohibition there were
2,000 breweries in America.

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:26.700
And the population was
like, 40, 50 million.

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:29.600
The population now
it's 325 million.

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:32.090
We can handle this.

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:34.900
I think the future
of craft beer,

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:37.720
the successful
craft breweries are

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:43.370
going to be the breweries that
establish and maintain trust

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:45.100
with their customers.

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:49.330
You drink Brooklyn because
you live in New York,

00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:52.360
and you like the beer, or
you've been to the brewery,

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:57.870
or we've given to your
favorite charity, or whatever.

00:45:57.870 --> 00:46:00.150
But you have faith
in that brewery.

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:03.020
And I think that the
breweries that succeed

00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:05.020
are going to be the
ones that maintain

00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:08.980
that bond with the customers
because the customers,

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:11.170
the beer drinkers
have really made us.

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:16.680
We didn't brainwash them with
television advertising or radio

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:18.050
advertising.

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:19.320
They discovered us.

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:21.830
And they kind of
own us, and that's

00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:27.170
a relationship that's very
precious for all craft brewers.

00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:28.958
Thank you.

00:46:28.958 --> 00:46:33.654
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:33.654 --> 00:46:34.320
MIKE: Let's see.

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:37.084
Before we take questions, just
a few quick announcements.

00:46:37.084 --> 00:46:39.292
First, thanks to Alan Seals
and the authors of Google

00:46:39.292 --> 00:46:42.375
team for making this talk
possible, a lot of hard work

00:46:42.375 --> 00:46:43.590
behind the scenes.

00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:45.580
Thanks to Steve for
sending us delicious beer.

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:47.850
It's been really hard having
that for the last month

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:52.298
at my desk and not
[INAUDIBLE] for all of you.

00:46:52.298 --> 00:46:54.770
The books are for sale for
$10 in the back corner,

00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:56.123
it's a subsidized price.

00:46:56.123 --> 00:46:58.498
And if you have questions,
please use the mic right here.

00:46:58.498 --> 00:47:01.780
Thank you.

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:04.264
Thanks, Mike.

00:47:04.264 --> 00:47:05.680
AUDIENCE: How are
you doing Steve?

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:06.660
STEVE HINDY: Good.

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:09.707
AUDIENCE: So craft brewer
myself in Brooklyn,

00:47:09.707 --> 00:47:11.665
Park Slope, backyard,
your old stomping ground.

00:47:11.665 --> 00:47:12.740
STEVE HINDY: Uh-huh.

00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:14.376
AUDIENCE: Shoutut to the
Brooklyn [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:14.376 --> 00:47:15.084
It's my favorite.

00:47:15.084 --> 00:47:17.240
I don't know if that's
[INAUDIBLE] Garrett's?

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:19.206
Quick question, so I'm
actually heading out

00:47:19.206 --> 00:47:21.205
to the Ommegang for their
little camping session

00:47:21.205 --> 00:47:22.220
that they do every year.

00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:24.070
Been going there for years.

00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:27.319
Chimay bought them
out a couple years.

00:47:27.319 --> 00:47:28.610
STEVE HINDY: Not Chimay, Duvel.

00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:29.431
AUDIENCE: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:47:29.431 --> 00:47:29.930
Yes.

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:31.572
STEVE HINDY: Yeah,
Mort got that.

00:47:31.572 --> 00:47:33.947
AUDIENCE: Right, there's sort
of a trend that's going on.

00:47:33.947 --> 00:47:38.000
The same thing happened with
Goose Island bought out by,

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.654
Budweiser, and they were
bought out by InBev.

00:47:40.654 --> 00:47:41.820
Where do you see that going?

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:43.835
It's almost like a
startup situation

00:47:43.835 --> 00:47:46.285
that we have here where if
you come with a good beer

00:47:46.285 --> 00:47:49.422
you get bought out or you
isolate, keep yourself

00:47:49.422 --> 00:47:52.989
contained, maintain
just to your audience.

00:47:52.989 --> 00:47:54.780
Where do you see the
future as far as that?

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:57.170
Because I know obviously
these agencies,

00:47:57.170 --> 00:48:01.030
these bigger companies obviously
know the power of craft beer.

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:04.823
So if they see something, maybe
a spark, do they buy it up?

00:48:04.823 --> 00:48:06.765
And do you get rich quick?

00:48:06.765 --> 00:48:08.010
Just your thoughts on that.

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:09.250
STEVE HINDY: Yeah.

00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:11.260
Well, I think some
people are going

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:14.650
to sell, no question about it.

00:48:14.650 --> 00:48:19.590
John Hall from Goose Island
sold to Anheuser-Busch.

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:23.480
John started the same year
I did, I know him very well,

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.140
he and his son Greg.

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:28.670
But Greg told his
dad he really didn't

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:30.490
want to do this for
the rest of his life.

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:35.390
So John is, at the time he sold,
I think he was 69 years old.

00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:38.090
And what you're going to do?

00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:39.340
He cashed out.

00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:41.370
I have no problem with that.

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:49.640
I think for the big guys,
craft beer is a real dilemma.

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:52.070
MillerCoors makes Blue Moon.

00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:54.920
AB has Shock Top, now
they have Goose Island.

00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:59.730
They bought Bluepoint out on
Long Island a couple of months

00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:00.230
ago.

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:08.520
They're going to play in our
segment, no question about it.

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.590
I don't think they can
dominate our segment the way

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:15.400
they dominated mainstream beer.

00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:19.600
Also, I think the more they
play in our segment the more

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:22.180
they undercut their big brands.

00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:25.450
When I started in
business, imports

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:27.940
were 3% of the US market.

00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:30.600
The other 97% was
national brands.

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:33.570
Today, imports are 13%.

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:37.770
Craft beer is like
more than 10%,

00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:41.820
and MillerCoors
and InBev are 74%.

00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:48.760
So arguably, we've pushed
them back from 97% to 74%.

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:51.230
And it's going to
continue, I think.

00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:53.460
They're going to
buy craft breweries.

00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:55.670
There's a guy I know
who's on the board,

00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:57.540
I actually I know a
lot of the big brewers

00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:00.510
because I've been on their
board for several years.

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:06.430
They have one token small guy
on the board, and it's been me.

00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:08.670
One of the guys on the
board of MillerCoors,

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:11.610
I was having an argument
with him one day.

00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:18.500
I said, Fritz, Blue
Moon's a big brand.

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:22.330
He said, Steve, it doesn't
move the needle for us.

00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:24.420
It doesn't matter.

00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:28.210
And that's kind of the
way they look at things.

00:50:28.210 --> 00:50:36.680
AB InBev last year sold
323 million barrels of beer

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:39.070
worldwide.

00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:46.390
SAB Miller sold 210 million,
Molson Coors sold 51 million.

00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:50.920
The whole craft beer segment
is about 20 million barrels.

00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:53.730
So we have a long,
long way to go,

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:56.220
and I think there are going
to be many years of growth.

00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:59.980
And I think the most
successful companies are

00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:02.660
going to be the ones
that stay independent,

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:05.120
and that's what were
determined to do.

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:08.677
My business partners will
be the next generation

00:51:08.677 --> 00:51:09.510
of Brooklyn Brewery.

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:11.022
We're not going to sell out.

00:51:11.022 --> 00:51:11.980
AUDIENCE: Good to hear.

00:51:14.692 --> 00:51:16.050
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:16.050 --> 00:51:18.772
Thanks for coming,
appreciate the talk a lot.

00:51:18.772 --> 00:51:22.910
I had the good fortunes
of being in Denmark

00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:25.265
earlier this year,
and really had

00:51:25.265 --> 00:51:27.570
a blast at Mikkeller
&amp; Friends and tasted

00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:28.680
some phenomenal stuff.

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:31.835
I just wanted to get your
view on internationally,

00:51:31.835 --> 00:51:32.969
what's the place to watch?

00:51:32.969 --> 00:51:34.719
Where do you think a
lot of the cool stuff

00:51:34.719 --> 00:51:38.000
is happening outside the US?

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:43.140
STEVE HINDY: Well,
we're, I think,

00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:46.020
the biggest exporter
of craft beer.

00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:53.890
Last year, of our 220,000
barrels, about 28% was export.

00:51:53.890 --> 00:52:00.660
And our biggest markets
are Scandinavia and the UK.

00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:03.240
We're doing really
well in France.

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:05.210
It's beginning to
happen in Brazil

00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:08.040
in a big way, and Australia.

00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:12.900
And we just opened a brewery
in Stockholm with Carlsberg.

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:14.850
It's a partnership
called New Carnegie

00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:16.850
Brewery by Brooklyn Brewery.

00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:19.340
If you go to Stockholm
you have to go visit.

00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:21.210
It's got a restaurant,
it's really cool.

00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:24.440
You can get there
by a ferry boat.

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:30.340
So there's a lot of really cool
stuff happening in Scandinavia.

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:34.760
We just did our Mash
Festival in London last week,

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:37.480
and I was amazed.

00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:44.000
London now, there are 69
craft breweries in London.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.540
When I was in London in
the '90s when we first

00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:51.280
started selling there, most
of the bars were tied houses.

00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:53.720
So they're controlled
by the breweries.

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:56.340
There were only a handful
of free houses, which

00:52:56.340 --> 00:53:00.350
is a bar that can buy from
anybody that want to buy from.

00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:04.120
Now there are
countless free houses,

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:07.220
and they're carrying American
craft beer and British craft

00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:08.000
beer.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.490
And a lot of the tide
houses are buying their way

00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:14.400
out of the relationships they
have with the big breweries

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.780
so they can carry craft beers.

00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:20.410
So we did an event at the
Camden Town Brewery, which

00:53:20.410 --> 00:53:23.710
is, I think Meantime
in Camden are

00:53:23.710 --> 00:53:28.900
the two biggest among
the London breweries.

00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:32.880
You've got to go see this
place is if you're in London.

00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:36.950
A lot of the breweries are done
where the cheapest rent is, not

00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:37.920
surprised.

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:42.200
They're done in these arches
under the rail trestles.

00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:46.710
Camden is unbelievable.

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:49.450
They have eight arches.

00:53:49.450 --> 00:53:51.650
A lot of the arches
you can't connect them

00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:53.100
because they're structural.

00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:54.520
But Camden, you can.

00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:56.260
So they have all these arches.

00:53:56.260 --> 00:54:01.310
They have fermenters
out in this alley kind

00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:05.510
of under the catwalks
for the trains.

00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:08.580
I don't know how they ever
got approval for this.

00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:09.960
And actually, the
guy from Camden

00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:13.170
said, well, what they
don't know won't hurt them.

00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:16.590
And across the street now,
there are apartment buildings.

00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:19.390
But when they opened,
it's kind of like what

00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:21.270
happened to us in Brooklyn.

00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:23.910
When they opened there
was nothing there.

00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:28.330
It was like a big, empty
lot across the street.

00:54:28.330 --> 00:54:32.250
So I think there's really
cool stuff happening

00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:35.920
in Denmark, in
Sweden, in Norway.

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:38.990
It's going to happen everywhere.

00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:41.050
And I'm sure the
Brazilians will come up

00:54:41.050 --> 00:54:46.970
with a lot besides ant beer.

00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:48.840
Yes?

00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.680
AUDIENCE: Hey, thank
so much for coming out.

00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:53.572
Just a quick question regarding
actually the Reddit AMA thread.

00:54:53.572 --> 00:54:57.234
I read through that, and your
number one piece of life advice

00:54:57.234 --> 00:54:58.775
was, don't do business
with assholes.

00:54:58.775 --> 00:54:59.150
STEVE HINDY: Yeah.

00:54:59.150 --> 00:55:01.370
AUDIENCE: Followed up by a
couple separation agreements,

00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:01.983
and stuff.

00:55:01.983 --> 00:55:04.529
Is there personal
anecdotes or situations

00:55:04.529 --> 00:55:07.076
that happened that made
this your number one

00:55:07.076 --> 00:55:09.990
piece of life advice?

00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:15.032
STEVE HINDY: Well, with Reddit
you've got to be on it, right?

00:55:15.032 --> 00:55:15.531
Yeah.

00:55:20.570 --> 00:55:22.574
Milton Glaser is my designer.

00:55:22.574 --> 00:55:24.490
Milton's the guy who did
the "I love New York"

00:55:24.490 --> 00:55:27.740
logo, very wise man.

00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:30.060
Milton's 85 years old now.

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:33.040
We've been working
together for 30 years.

00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:38.180
And Milton is the one
who basically gave me

00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:42.440
that bit of advice
many, many years ago.

00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:48.750
Because he doesn't design
for people he doesn't like.

00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:52.500
And it's been
pretty good advice.

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:56.100
There have been cases
where we have done business

00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:58.220
with people who we
didn't really like,

00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:01.600
and usually it ends badly.

00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:07.370
Like there are a
lot of big retailers

00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:11.890
who basically will
say to me, look,

00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:15.400
I'll pay you this for your beer.

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:20.770
Like your keg price is $100,
we're going to pay $75.

00:56:20.770 --> 00:56:23.680
And your face, you
know that you're

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:26.980
selling to hundreds
of people for $100,

00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:30.370
and here's this jerk
telling you, no, I'm

00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:32.050
going to buy for $75.

00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:34.860
And your best customers
are paying the full price.

00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:38.090
Now, a lot of brewers will
deal with people like that.

00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:39.690
I don't.

00:56:39.690 --> 00:56:43.680
I couldn't live with myself
if I'm selling to my better

00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:45.640
customers at this
higher price and I'm

00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:48.560
giving this jerk
a price for $75.

00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:50.870
And I've seen it happen.

00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:52.840
It doesn't pay off
in the long run.

00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:55.610
So anyway, not to get
carried away with that,

00:56:55.610 --> 00:56:58.630
I think it's pretty good advice.

00:56:58.630 --> 00:57:02.557
Maybe unavoidable
sometimes, but-- yeah?

00:57:02.557 --> 00:57:03.390
AUDIENCE: Hey there.

00:57:03.390 --> 00:57:05.115
Thanks for coming in.

00:57:05.115 --> 00:57:09.220
I actually had a follow up
question on one of early ones,

00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:13.320
breweries were using areas
where the rent's fairly low.

00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:14.384
STEVE HINDY: With what?

00:57:14.384 --> 00:57:15.800
AUDIENCE: How
breweries tend to go

00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:17.940
for areas with the
really low rents.

00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:20.404
STEVE HINDY: Yeah.

00:57:20.404 --> 00:57:21.820
AUDIENCE: I think
my parents would

00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:24.140
be worried for me if I
started a brewery there.

00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:26.098
Do you know people, does
it usually work out OK

00:57:26.098 --> 00:57:29.040
for the brewers?

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:29.970
STEVE HINDY: Well.

00:57:29.970 --> 00:57:33.640
our first warehouse
was in Bushwick

00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:39.170
off Bushwick avenue one Meserole
in an old brewery building.

00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:44.550
And truck drivers would not
come in there after dark,

00:57:44.550 --> 00:57:47.190
these big truck
drivers would call in

00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:48.940
and say, we'll be
there in the morning.

00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:51.860
We're not coming this afternoon.

00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:56.300
And most mornings when
we came in to open up,

00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:59.550
there were junkies across the
street in this little needle

00:57:59.550 --> 00:58:00.950
park.

00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:10.450
But I had been in Beirut and
Baghdad, so I could handle it.

00:58:10.450 --> 00:58:12.650
But it's true.

00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:16.470
All the craft
brewers in London are

00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:18.990
in very dicey kind
of neighborhoods.

00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:22.820
I did an event in DC, part
of our Mash thing recently,

00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:26.200
and it was in a really
skeezy part of the DC.

00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:29.250
So that's kind of the way it is.

00:58:29.250 --> 00:58:31.850
You're manufacturing,
you can't afford

00:58:31.850 --> 00:58:35.350
to pay $20 a foot for your rent.

00:58:35.350 --> 00:58:37.480
You've got to go
where it's $3 a foot.

00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:43.150
But my parents were
thrilled that I

00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:47.340
had come back to the USA.

00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:52.030
Actually, my father did
not understand or believe

00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:53.220
in journalism.

00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:56.780
He was thrilled when I said
I'm going into business.

00:58:56.780 --> 00:58:57.800
It was like, finally!

00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:59.800
You'll make some money
with that Cornell degree.

00:59:03.577 --> 00:59:04.410
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:06.690
STEVE HINDY: You're welcome.

00:59:06.690 --> 00:59:07.940
Well, thank you all very much.

00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:10.860
I'd be happy to sign
some books if you want.

00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:15.990
And if you have further
questions, have a nice day.

00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:18.370
Do you want to know
about the beers?

00:59:18.370 --> 00:59:19.680
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:22.690
STEVE HINDY: So that wheat beer,
Brooklyn Green Market Wheat,

00:59:22.690 --> 00:59:27.100
we do that with the GrowNYC,
the not for profit company that

00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:32.030
runs all the 53 farmers
markets in New York City.

00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:36.690
And it's made with
70% local ingredients.

00:59:36.690 --> 00:59:39.630
So the grain is grown
in upstate New York.

00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:43.580
There's some barley from
Massachusetts in that beer.

00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:47.640
And we're committed
to growing that brand.

00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:52.190
So we had a wheat beer called
Brooklyner Weisse which

00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:56.250
we got rid of, and that's
our main wheat beer now.

00:59:56.250 --> 01:00:01.650
And part of the proceeds
goes to the GrowNYC

01:00:01.650 --> 01:00:05.620
of every bottle we
sell of that beer.

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:07.430
And they sell it at
the green markets,

01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:10.600
and they make all the
retail markup on that.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:15.240
So it's our way of
supporting farmers,

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:18.130
and we're hoping
the farmers upstate

01:00:18.130 --> 01:00:19.900
are going to grow
more grain every year

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:21.850
so we can produce
more of this beer

01:00:21.850 --> 01:00:25.480
and take it beyond
New York state.

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:29.300
The other beer,
Brooklyn Cuvee Noir,

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:33.180
is a strong stout that we
age in bourbon barrels.

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:36.210
It's also got a little
sweet orange peel in it.

01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:39.060
It's aged in bourbon barrels
for more than six months,

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:41.270
and it's part of our
barrel age series.

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:46.350
Every quarter we have a
different bottled beer

01:00:46.350 --> 01:00:51.750
that's aged in bourbon barrels,
or wine barrels, or whatever.

01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:56.986
I think the last one was Wild
Streak, which is basically

01:00:56.986 --> 01:01:02.010
a version of a local one
aged in bourbon barrels

01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:04.570
and finished off with
a Brettanomyces yeast.

01:01:04.570 --> 01:01:10.260
Brettanomyces creates
sour flavors in the beer.

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:14.960
So that's part of our
innovation series of beers.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:18.430
We don't really call it that,
but that's what it's all about.

01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:22.620
Actually, we just took a big
warehouse in the Navy Yard

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:24.910
to expand our
barrel aging program

01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:29.000
because the little warehouse
we had over near the brewery,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.020
we outgrew it.

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:35.160
So you're going to see some
exciting beers come out

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.790
of that series.

01:01:36.790 --> 01:01:39.720
And I hope you liked Cuvee Noir.

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:41.320
And if you go on
our website, there's

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:46.040
a great video that
Garrett did, Garrett,

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:49.400
our brewmaster about Cuvee Noir.

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:54.200
And it's kind of like a
Dashiell Hammett sort of scene.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:57.710
Garrett's a great performer
as well as a great brewer.

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:02.790
Thank you very much.
