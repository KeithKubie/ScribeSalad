00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:08.330
some ways we are in a good age of

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340
some ways we are in a good age of
 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.390
some ways we are in a good age of
science I mean I don't I think actually

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400
science I mean I don't I think actually
 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.520
science I mean I don't I think actually
many respects science science is doing

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530
many respects science science is doing
 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.670
many respects science science is doing
well right now you know in terms of but

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680
well right now you know in terms of but
 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.410
well right now you know in terms of but
I think there's just a general fear that

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420
I think there's just a general fear that
 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.929
I think there's just a general fear that
that won't continue that people won't

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939
that won't continue that people won't
 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.250
that won't continue that people won't
take it seriously that if there are

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260
take it seriously that if there are
 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.540
take it seriously that if there are
budget cuts that's where it will happen

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550
budget cuts that's where it will happen
 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.359
budget cuts that's where it will happen
I think it's really important that we

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369
I think it's really important that we
 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.880
I think it's really important that we
recognize the really important role

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890
recognize the really important role
 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.130
recognize the really important role
science has played not just people doing

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140
science has played not just people doing
 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.720
science has played not just people doing
science but people being trained as

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730
science but people being trained as
 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.580
science but people being trained as
scientists a lot of people who have gone

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590
scientists a lot of people who have gone
 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.069
scientists a lot of people who have gone
out and done important things have for

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079
out and done important things have for
 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.630
out and done important things have for
trained a scientist I'm always surprised

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640
trained a scientist I'm always surprised
 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.190
trained a scientist I'm always surprised
whatever you people know they tell me

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200
whatever you people know they tell me
 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.049
whatever you people know they tell me
they tell me that they were actually a

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059
they tell me that they were actually a
 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.280
they tell me that they were actually a
lot of people who read my book for

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290
lot of people who read my book for
 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.900
lot of people who read my book for
example or you know will be in different

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910
example or you know will be in different
 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.760
example or you know will be in different
fields in and there'll be people who

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770
fields in and there'll be people who
 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.049
fields in and there'll be people who
aren't doing anything life science now

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059
aren't doing anything life science now
 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.549
aren't doing anything life science now
but they were trained as scientists and

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559
but they were trained as scientists and
 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.490
but they were trained as scientists and
I think we really have to appreciate how

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500
I think we really have to appreciate how
 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.340
I think we really have to appreciate how
critical that is I think this sort of

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350
critical that is I think this sort of
 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.830
critical that is I think this sort of
and how important basic research is not

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840
and how important basic research is not
 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.869
and how important basic research is not
just applied research but people really

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879
just applied research but people really
 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.610
just applied research but people really
working on fundamental problems being

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620
working on fundamental problems being
 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.869
working on fundamental problems being
allowed to think about that and how

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879
allowed to think about that and how
 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.210
allowed to think about that and how
basic research has had these broad

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220
basic research has had these broad
 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.859
basic research has had these broad
ranging implications in the future that

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869
ranging implications in the future that
 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.120
ranging implications in the future that
we didn't anticipate so just I think a

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130
we didn't anticipate so just I think a
 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.500
we didn't anticipate so just I think a
general recognition of the role that

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510
general recognition of the role that
 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.170
general recognition of the role that
science has played it would be really

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180
science has played it would be really
 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.890
science has played it would be really
important

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900
 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.960
