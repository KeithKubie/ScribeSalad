in 2010 and we explored it more and we

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970
in 2010 and we explored it more and we
 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.300
in 2010 and we explored it more and we
wanted to continue fault lines and and

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310
wanted to continue fault lines and and
 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.280
wanted to continue fault lines and and
even get into maybe even bigger systems

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290
even get into maybe even bigger systems
 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.979
even get into maybe even bigger systems
anyway it gave me some heroes in in the

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989
anyway it gave me some heroes in in the
 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.890
anyway it gave me some heroes in in the
beginning because I knew that it's these

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900
beginning because I knew that it's these

happened to how one he just put his
 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.499
happened to how one he just put his
wetsuit out there on the knees a tree

rid of them just went into his wetsuit
 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.670
rid of them just went into his wetsuit
and wanted to do a cave and then

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680
and wanted to do a cave and then
 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.290
and wanted to do a cave and then
everything got irritating in his back

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:08.300
everything got irritating in his back
 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.839
everything got irritating in his back
and painful and it was stinging and it

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:10.849
and painful and it was stinging and it
 

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:13.659
and painful and it was stinging and it
was poisonous and whatever so he had a

was poisonous and whatever so he had a
 

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:15.580
was poisonous and whatever so he had a
really hard time he had to get out of

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:15.590
really hard time he had to get out of
 

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.230
really hard time he had to get out of
the cave here to get you finish

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240
the cave here to get you finish
 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.450
the cave here to get you finish
everything it had was really painful the

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:19.460
everything it had was really painful the
 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.339
everything it had was really painful the
porters were laughing at him but then

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:21.349
porters were laughing at him but then
 

00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:24.219
porters were laughing at him but then
they realized it was more serious than

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:24.229
they realized it was more serious than
 

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:25.809
they realized it was more serious than
that and he's in a really awkward

00:07:25.809 --> 00:07:25.819
that and he's in a really awkward
 

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:28.869
that and he's in a really awkward
situation and has pain and they have to

00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:28.879
situation and has pain and they have to
 

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:30.700
situation and has pain and they have to
do something about it and they put him

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:30.710
do something about it and they put him
 

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.219
do something about it and they put him
on fire and with a lot of warms after

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:33.229
on fire and with a lot of warms after
 

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:36.700
on fire and with a lot of warms after
eventually after four or five hours the

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:36.710
eventually after four or five hours the
 

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:41.200
eventually after four or five hours the
pain was receding and yeah he had a

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:41.210
pain was receding and yeah he had a
 

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.619
pain was receding and yeah he had a
tough time anyway so little stories

00:07:44.619 --> 00:07:44.629
tough time anyway so little stories
 

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:46.300
tough time anyway so little stories
besides so but that's what you

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:46.310
besides so but that's what you
 

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.519
besides so but that's what you
experience on the experi

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:47.529
experience on the experi
 

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:50.879
experience on the experi
like this but it's it's incredible I

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:50.889
like this but it's it's incredible I
 

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:54.989
like this but it's it's incredible I
mean the variety of butterflies and

00:07:54.989 --> 00:07:54.999
mean the variety of butterflies and
 

00:07:54.999 --> 00:07:57.029
mean the variety of butterflies and
sometimes they are big like birds and

00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039
sometimes they are big like birds and
 

00:07:57.039 --> 00:07:59.789
sometimes they are big like birds and
they really surprise you with

00:07:59.789 --> 00:07:59.799
they really surprise you with
 

00:07:59.799 --> 00:08:03.659
they really surprise you with
IRA's iridescent wings and really it's

00:08:03.659 --> 00:08:03.669
IRA's iridescent wings and really it's
 

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:10.270
IRA's iridescent wings and really it's
amazing

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:10.280
 
 

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.760
 
so and for cave exploring you have to

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:12.770
so and for cave exploring you have to
 

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.090
so and for cave exploring you have to
follow any lead any little fissure and

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:16.100
follow any lead any little fissure and
 

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.080
follow any lead any little fissure and
in the beginning it's quite difficult to

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:20.090
in the beginning it's quite difficult to
 

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.890
in the beginning it's quite difficult to
find really major systems so you can't

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:23.900
find really major systems so you can't
 

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.260
find really major systems so you can't
see it like a mountain you have to you

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:26.270
see it like a mountain you have to you
 

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.090
see it like a mountain you have to you
have to crawl into anything which

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:28.100
have to crawl into anything which
 

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.680
have to crawl into anything which
what-what is kind of opening and

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:31.690
what-what is kind of opening and
 

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.630
what-what is kind of opening and
unfortunately we have been very unhappy

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640
unfortunately we have been very unhappy
 

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.209
unfortunately we have been very unhappy
on that trip so there was a lot of

00:08:37.209 --> 00:08:37.219
on that trip so there was a lot of
 

00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:40.149
on that trip so there was a lot of
effort a lot of walking but without

00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:40.159
effort a lot of walking but without
 

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:43.540
effort a lot of walking but without
really the big results so we find only

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:43.550
really the big results so we find only
 

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:48.390
really the big results so we find only
mine while marginal descends so probably

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:48.400
mine while marginal descends so probably
 

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.670
mine while marginal descends so probably
if you go further in maybe there are the

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680
if you go further in maybe there are the
 

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.230
if you go further in maybe there are the
big systems but you never know exactly

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:53.240
big systems but you never know exactly
 

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.200
big systems but you never know exactly
so we had something like 20 meter drops

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:56.210
so we had something like 20 meter drops
 

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:57.970
so we had something like 20 meter drops
and that was it so it was always

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:57.980
and that was it so it was always
 

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.110
and that was it so it was always
disappointing on the other hand we we've

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.120
disappointing on the other hand we we've
 

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.340
disappointing on the other hand we we've
met this kind of people

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:03.350
met this kind of people
 

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:08.380
met this kind of people
it is Fong na ki bong National Park it's

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:08.390
it is Fong na ki bong National Park it's
 

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:10.600
it is Fong na ki bong National Park it's
a World Heritage Site but still there

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:10.610
a World Heritage Site but still there
 

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:13.510
a World Heritage Site but still there
are these illegal loggers and also

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:13.520
are these illegal loggers and also
 

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.230
are these illegal loggers and also
illegal hunters so it's amazing how much

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:17.240
illegal hunters so it's amazing how much
 

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.900
illegal hunters so it's amazing how much
they carry these are maybe 100 pound man

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:19.910
they carry these are maybe 100 pound man
 

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.140
they carry these are maybe 100 pound man
carrying 200 pounds on their back on

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:23.150
carrying 200 pounds on their back on
 

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.860
carrying 200 pounds on their back on
this very ragged landscape with their

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:26.870
this very ragged landscape with their
 

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.550
this very ragged landscape with their
plastic sandals it's it's incredible how

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560
plastic sandals it's it's incredible how
 

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.900
plastic sandals it's it's incredible how
they manage it here on the entrance it's

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:34.910
they manage it here on the entrance it's
 

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:37.570
they manage it here on the entrance it's
like a like a living thing that cave

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:37.580
like a like a living thing that cave
 

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.329
like a like a living thing that cave
freezes and has clouds inside so

00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:40.339
freezes and has clouds inside so
 

00:09:40.339 --> 00:09:42.820
freezes and has clouds inside so
everything comes out and it's almost

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:42.830
everything comes out and it's almost
 

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.300
everything comes out and it's almost
like a storm and moves the the leaves

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:46.310
like a storm and moves the the leaves
 

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:50.579
like a storm and moves the the leaves
and yeah it's a kind of a cold wind and

00:09:50.579 --> 00:09:50.589
and yeah it's a kind of a cold wind and
 

00:09:50.589 --> 00:09:53.200
and yeah it's a kind of a cold wind and
for me as a photograph I it was always

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:53.210
for me as a photograph I it was always
 

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:55.540
for me as a photograph I it was always
kind of tricky to have to deal with so

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:55.550
kind of tricky to have to deal with so
 

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:58.800
kind of tricky to have to deal with so
much fog I didn't reckon with that and

00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:58.810
much fog I didn't reckon with that and
 

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.870
much fog I didn't reckon with that and
yeah I had to somehow live with that

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:01.880
yeah I had to somehow live with that
 

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.090
yeah I had to somehow live with that
because they always always some sort of

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:04.100
because they always always some sort of
 

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.150
because they always always some sort of
condensation and it was tricky to get

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:07.160
condensation and it was tricky to get
 

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.570
condensation and it was tricky to get
some clear view especially here in the

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:10.580
some clear view especially here in the
 

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.610
some clear view especially here in the
entrance there was a lot of condensation

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:12.620
entrance there was a lot of condensation
 

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.370
entrance there was a lot of condensation
when the cool air comes out of the cave

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:15.380
when the cool air comes out of the cave
 

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:21.100
when the cool air comes out of the cave
it just it just condensate and well soon

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:21.110
it just it just condensate and well soon
 

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.260
it just it just condensate and well soon
in the beginning what I showed now is a

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:23.270
in the beginning what I showed now is a
 

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:23.880
in the beginning what I showed now is a
little

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:23.890
little
 

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.550
little
they were already this this beautiful

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:27.560
they were already this this beautiful
 

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:32.200
they were already this this beautiful
and impressive huge stars and I did what

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:32.210
and impressive huge stars and I did what
 

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.470
and impressive huge stars and I did what
I could do with illuminating this kind

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:35.480
I could do with illuminating this kind
 

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.490
I could do with illuminating this kind
of situations

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:36.500
of situations
 

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.370
of situations
despite this fog it was pretty

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:39.380
despite this fog it was pretty
 

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:44.290
despite this fog it was pretty
impressive to to see how how other it

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:44.300
impressive to to see how how other it
 

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.990
impressive to to see how how other it
changes with different light settings so

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:47.000
changes with different light settings so
 

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.560
changes with different light settings so
I overlaid some images to give you a

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:49.570
I overlaid some images to give you a
 

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:56.380
I overlaid some images to give you a
idea how you can visualize these sort of

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:56.390
idea how you can visualize these sort of
 

00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:01.860
idea how you can visualize these sort of
rooms but it was very beautiful entry

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:01.870
rooms but it was very beautiful entry
 

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:05.170
rooms but it was very beautiful entry
and then we come into this huge gallery

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:05.180
and then we come into this huge gallery
 

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:11.230
and then we come into this huge gallery
and this is half a mile away that is

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:11.240
and this is half a mile away that is
 

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.730
and this is half a mile away that is
called hand hands of talk and and and

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:15.740
called hand hands of talk and and and
 

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.340
called hand hands of talk and and and
after that is the view to the first door

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:18.350
after that is the view to the first door
 

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.650
after that is the view to the first door
line which is another half mile away so

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:20.660
line which is another half mile away so
 

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.580
line which is another half mile away so
it's actually one kilometer or 1 1 mile

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:24.590
it's actually one kilometer or 1 1 mile
 

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:28.930
it's actually one kilometer or 1 1 mile
towards the towards the opening and you

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:28.940
towards the towards the opening and you
 

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.500
towards the towards the opening and you
have this giant giant stalls I mean that

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:32.510
have this giant giant stalls I mean that
 

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.410
have this giant giant stalls I mean that
is like more than a 10 story building

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:35.420
is like more than a 10 story building
 

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:39.370
is like more than a 10 story building
this dystonic might and here you have as

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:39.380
this dystonic might and here you have as
 

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:43.390
this dystonic might and here you have as
a comparison a person yeah it's

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:43.400
a comparison a person yeah it's
 

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.600
a comparison a person yeah it's
absolutely unbelievable these dimensions

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:46.610
absolutely unbelievable these dimensions
 

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:51.780
absolutely unbelievable these dimensions
and it's difficult to put that in scale

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:51.790
and it's difficult to put that in scale
 

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:55.720
and it's difficult to put that in scale
so now I change the position to exactly

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:55.730
so now I change the position to exactly
 

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:57.970
so now I change the position to exactly
where that man stand and we see in the

00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:57.980
where that man stand and we see in the
 

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:01.840
where that man stand and we see in the
back far these little stalls but these

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:01.850
back far these little stalls but these
 

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:04.060
back far these little stalls but these
are the big ones we have seen in just in

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:04.070
are the big ones we have seen in just in
 

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:07.870
are the big ones we have seen in just in
the last frame so it just gives you an

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:07.880
the last frame so it just gives you an
 

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:12.760
the last frame so it just gives you an
idea how big these rooms are and that is

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:12.770
idea how big these rooms are and that is
 

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:16.660
idea how big these rooms are and that is
half a mile to these big stars and we

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:16.670
half a mile to these big stars and we
 

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:19.390
half a mile to these big stars and we
needed like 14 people to light this

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:19.400
needed like 14 people to light this
 

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:23.350
needed like 14 people to light this
gallery that was very very tricky and to

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360
gallery that was very very tricky and to
 

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.690
gallery that was very very tricky and to
lighting in that way that the fog

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:25.700
lighting in that way that the fog
 

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.760
lighting in that way that the fog
doesn't reflect the light so it was

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:27.770
doesn't reflect the light so it was
 

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:31.270
doesn't reflect the light so it was
pretty challenging to to make that shot

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:31.280
pretty challenging to to make that shot
 

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.350
pretty challenging to to make that shot
and we had of course a lot of problems

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:34.360
and we had of course a lot of problems
 

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.150
and we had of course a lot of problems
also in terms of communication with

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:37.160
also in terms of communication with
 

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.370
also in terms of communication with
there were a lot of Vietnamese you can

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:39.380
there were a lot of Vietnamese you can
 

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.400
there were a lot of Vietnamese you can
imagine what what it means to get that

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:42.410
imagine what what it means to get that
 

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:47.980
imagine what what it means to get that
somehow coordinated and with only a low

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:47.990
somehow coordinated and with only a low
 

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:50.470
somehow coordinated and with only a low
number of radios and then it should be

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480
number of radios and then it should be
 

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.840
number of radios and then it should be
translated and whatever it was just a

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:52.850
translated and whatever it was just a
 

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:54.300
translated and whatever it was just a
mess

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:54.310
mess
 

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:58.750
mess
and well here we are close now to the

00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:58.760
and well here we are close now to the
 

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:04.390
and well here we are close now to the
first sinkhole and it the the pictures

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:04.400
first sinkhole and it the the pictures
 

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.700
first sinkhole and it the the pictures
changed from the natural light setting

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:06.710
changed from the natural light setting
 

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:11.800
changed from the natural light setting
towards a little artificial ads which

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:11.810
towards a little artificial ads which
 

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:14.130
towards a little artificial ads which
which shows you how big some of these

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:14.140
which shows you how big some of these
 

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.780
which shows you how big some of these
rocks are which are just falling from

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:16.790
rocks are which are just falling from
 

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.450
rocks are which are just falling from
the ceiling yeah they are several storey

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:19.460
the ceiling yeah they are several storey
 

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.430
the ceiling yeah they are several storey
buildings which just fall from the

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440
buildings which just fall from the
 

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.760
buildings which just fall from the
ceiling so these dimensions are really

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:24.770
ceiling so these dimensions are really
 

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:28.030
ceiling so these dimensions are really
unbelievable and then just these little

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.040
unbelievable and then just these little
 

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.880
unbelievable and then just these little
stalls next to the person you you can

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:30.890
stalls next to the person you you can
 

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:33.580
stalls next to the person you you can
figure out how big it is and then there

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:33.590
figure out how big it is and then there
 

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:36.010
figure out how big it is and then there
was something very very strange what I

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:36.020
was something very very strange what I
 

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.710
was something very very strange what I
have never seen before like that it's

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720
have never seen before like that it's
 

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.800
have never seen before like that it's
it's a so-called phyto cost and these

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:41.810
it's a so-called phyto cost and these
 

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:48.520
it's a so-called phyto cost and these
are microorganisms who actively yeah

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:48.530
are microorganisms who actively yeah
 

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:51.370
are microorganisms who actively yeah
attract calcite and they grow it's some

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:51.380
attract calcite and they grow it's some
 

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.460
attract calcite and they grow it's some
kind of growing stone and this grows

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:54.470
kind of growing stone and this grows
 

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:56.710
kind of growing stone and this grows
towards the light these microorganisms

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720
towards the light these microorganisms
 

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.960
towards the light these microorganisms
they built their own castle and their

00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:58.970
they built their own castle and their
 

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:03.160
they built their own castle and their
heart shell with rock and and just it's

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:03.170
heart shell with rock and and just it's
 

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:05.980
heart shell with rock and and just it's
growing rock against against light it's

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:05.990
growing rock against against light it's
 

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:08.950
growing rock against against light it's
absolutely amazing so here we have the

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:08.960
absolutely amazing so here we have the
 

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.350
absolutely amazing so here we have the
dim light of of the first door line

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360
dim light of of the first door line
 

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.500
dim light of of the first door line
again and you see the size of these

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:14.510
again and you see the size of these
 

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:16.900
again and you see the size of these
boulders it's just massive everything

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:16.910
boulders it's just massive everything
 

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:20.560
boulders it's just massive everything
yeah you see a little of the forest on

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:20.570
yeah you see a little of the forest on
 

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.200
yeah you see a little of the forest on
the top and they are hanging wines and

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:23.210
the top and they are hanging wines and
 

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:26.920
the top and they are hanging wines and
some look like petrified icicles and

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:26.930
some look like petrified icicles and
 

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:31.030
some look like petrified icicles and
down there you have giant it's also a

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040
down there you have giant it's also a
 

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.940
down there you have giant it's also a
fight across stalagmite in a way and

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:33.950
fight across stalagmite in a way and
 

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.030
fight across stalagmite in a way and
it's over and over grown with with this

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.040
it's over and over grown with with this
 

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.790
it's over and over grown with with this
plans and this is the place they called

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:39.800
plans and this is the place they called
 

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.090
plans and this is the place they called
watch out for dinosaurs and somehow I

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:43.100
watch out for dinosaurs and somehow I
 

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.540
watch out for dinosaurs and somehow I
knew why

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:44.550
knew why
 

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.910
knew why
I wouldn't have wondered if someone

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920
I wouldn't have wondered if someone
 

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.000
I wouldn't have wondered if someone
looks around the edge and you and roars

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:50.010
looks around the edge and you and roars
 

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:54.170
looks around the edge and you and roars
and there are some crazy sounds too and

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:54.180
and there are some crazy sounds too and
 

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.509
and there are some crazy sounds too and
and here you see again this kind of

00:14:56.509 --> 00:14:56.519
and here you see again this kind of
 

00:14:56.519 --> 00:14:57.590
and here you see again this kind of
rocks

00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600
rocks
 

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.160
rocks
yeah which which which form around the

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:01.170
yeah which which which form around the
 

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.590
yeah which which which form around the
plants and the plants completely adapted

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600
plants and the plants completely adapted
 

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.540
plants and the plants completely adapted
to that so it's it's it's rock hard

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:05.550
to that so it's it's it's rock hard
 

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:10.100
to that so it's it's it's rock hard
their stems and yeah very to me very

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:10.110
their stems and yeah very to me very
 

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.280
their stems and yeah very to me very
fascinating yeah I would love to know

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:13.290
fascinating yeah I would love to know
 

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:16.130
fascinating yeah I would love to know
the biology behind it here you see

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:16.140
the biology behind it here you see
 

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:19.160
the biology behind it here you see
that's this massive style in the middle

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:19.170
that's this massive style in the middle
 

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:23.269
that's this massive style in the middle
it's about 200 feet high and all built

00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279
it's about 200 feet high and all built
 

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:26.870
it's about 200 feet high and all built
up by these microorganisms so in rainy

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880
up by these microorganisms so in rainy
 

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.910
up by these microorganisms so in rainy
season there is a waterfall coming or

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:28.920
season there is a waterfall coming or
 

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.460
season there is a waterfall coming or
just or if it rains a waterfall coming

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:31.470
just or if it rains a waterfall coming
 

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:35.030
just or if it rains a waterfall coming
down and you see that that this is the

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040
down and you see that that this is the
 

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.240
down and you see that that this is the
plant grows which influenced the stone

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:38.250
plant grows which influenced the stone
 

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:41.150
plant grows which influenced the stone
and and this is like like wings like

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160
and and this is like like wings like
 

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.910
and and this is like like wings like
fingers which grows towards light it's

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920
fingers which grows towards light it's
 

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:48.199
fingers which grows towards light it's
not like a normal rock formation so that

00:15:48.199 --> 00:15:48.209
not like a normal rock formation so that
 

00:15:48.209 --> 00:15:50.240
not like a normal rock formation so that
was pretty beautiful and it's always

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:50.250
was pretty beautiful and it's always
 

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.720
was pretty beautiful and it's always
like where water comes down where the

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:52.730
like where water comes down where the
 

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:56.600
like where water comes down where the
plants can get the calcite from and then

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:56.610
plants can get the calcite from and then
 

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:58.940
plants can get the calcite from and then
they grow against the light and you have

00:15:58.940 --> 00:15:58.950
they grow against the light and you have
 

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:03.949
they grow against the light and you have
really strange formations that is the

00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:03.959
really strange formations that is the
 

00:16:03.959 --> 00:16:06.860
really strange formations that is the
view from above and you look down in a

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:06.870
view from above and you look down in a
 

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:09.290
view from above and you look down in a
huge gallery that galleries maybe 300

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:09.300
huge gallery that galleries maybe 300
 

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.250
huge gallery that galleries maybe 300
feet high yeah these dimensions are

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:12.260
feet high yeah these dimensions are
 

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.690
feet high yeah these dimensions are
exceptional and just to light it it's

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:14.700
exceptional and just to light it it's
 

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:19.730
exceptional and just to light it it's
also a challenge and you have this big

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:19.740
also a challenge and you have this big
 

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.850
also a challenge and you have this big
Gower's in the front and and then you

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:22.860
Gower's in the front and and then you
 

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.910
Gower's in the front and and then you
have this crazy balconies in this shaft

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920
have this crazy balconies in this shaft
 

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:31.579
have this crazy balconies in this shaft
so these plates they were like six

00:16:31.579 --> 00:16:31.589
so these plates they were like six
 

00:16:31.589 --> 00:16:35.569
so these plates they were like six
meters that's maybe 18 feet 20 feet into

00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:35.579
meters that's maybe 18 feet 20 feet into
 

00:16:35.579 --> 00:16:38.600
meters that's maybe 18 feet 20 feet into
into the into the room so these are also

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:38.610
into the into the room so these are also
 

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:43.490
into the into the room so these are also
kind of growing rocks and and all Fano

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:43.500
kind of growing rocks and and all Fano
 

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.910
kind of growing rocks and and all Fano
means due to the phyto cost and then we

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920
means due to the phyto cost and then we
 

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.389
means due to the phyto cost and then we
we witnessed a thunderstorm going over

00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399
we witnessed a thunderstorm going over
 

00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:53.240
we witnessed a thunderstorm going over
us and it rumbled and it echoed and

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:53.250
us and it rumbled and it echoed and
 

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.819
us and it rumbled and it echoed and
suddenly you hear splashing and rumbling

00:16:55.819 --> 00:16:55.829
suddenly you hear splashing and rumbling
 

00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:56.879
suddenly you hear splashing and rumbling
and water

00:16:56.879 --> 00:16:56.889
and water
 

00:16:56.889 --> 00:17:00.119
and water
like water filling pipes and everything

00:17:00.119 --> 00:17:00.129
like water filling pipes and everything
 

00:17:00.129 --> 00:17:03.299
like water filling pipes and everything
sounded like in another dimension and

00:17:03.299 --> 00:17:03.309
sounded like in another dimension and
 

00:17:03.309 --> 00:17:07.649
sounded like in another dimension and
suddenly this fighter cost things they

00:17:07.649 --> 00:17:07.659
suddenly this fighter cost things they
 

00:17:07.659 --> 00:17:11.100
suddenly this fighter cost things they
spit water like yeah and waterfalls came

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:11.110
spit water like yeah and waterfalls came
 

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:14.009
spit water like yeah and waterfalls came
out and I reacted fast to arrange for

00:17:14.009 --> 00:17:14.019
out and I reacted fast to arrange for
 

00:17:14.019 --> 00:17:15.840
out and I reacted fast to arrange for
shots and who knows how long it takes

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:15.850
shots and who knows how long it takes
 

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:19.590
shots and who knows how long it takes
but that was pretty amazing to find

00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600
but that was pretty amazing to find
 

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.230
but that was pretty amazing to find
suddenly these waterfalls normally it

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240
suddenly these waterfalls normally it
 

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.480
suddenly these waterfalls normally it
should frighten you because I mean to

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:24.490
should frighten you because I mean to
 

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:26.549
should frighten you because I mean to
have a water break in like this it's

00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559
have a water break in like this it's
 

00:17:26.559 --> 00:17:29.700
have a water break in like this it's
almost or in a cave or always quite

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:29.710
almost or in a cave or always quite
 

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:32.639
almost or in a cave or always quite
dangerous but this cave is so big that

00:17:32.639 --> 00:17:32.649
dangerous but this cave is so big that
 

00:17:32.649 --> 00:17:34.230
dangerous but this cave is so big that
you don't need to be afraid that the

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240
you don't need to be afraid that the
 

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.409
you don't need to be afraid that the
water can kind of close you in or that

00:17:37.409 --> 00:17:37.419
water can kind of close you in or that
 

00:17:37.419 --> 00:17:39.870
water can kind of close you in or that
you might drown or whatever so was not

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:39.880
you might drown or whatever so was not
 

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.629
you might drown or whatever so was not
the issue but it was overwhelming I mean

00:17:42.629 --> 00:17:42.639
the issue but it was overwhelming I mean
 

00:17:42.639 --> 00:17:44.789
the issue but it was overwhelming I mean
you could imagine the noise I mean it

00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:44.799
you could imagine the noise I mean it
 

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:47.789
you could imagine the noise I mean it
was splashing it was roaring and it was

00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:47.799
was splashing it was roaring and it was
 

00:17:47.799 --> 00:17:49.759
was splashing it was roaring and it was
yeah very loud difficult to communicate

00:17:49.759 --> 00:17:49.769
yeah very loud difficult to communicate
 

00:17:49.769 --> 00:17:53.190
yeah very loud difficult to communicate
difficult to tell what what to do and

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200
difficult to tell what what to do and
 

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.889
difficult to tell what what to do and
how to light and whatever so it was a

00:17:55.889 --> 00:17:55.899
how to light and whatever so it was a
 

00:17:55.899 --> 00:17:59.610
how to light and whatever so it was a
jump running jumping and fast reactions

00:17:59.610 --> 00:17:59.620
jump running jumping and fast reactions
 

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:05.759
jump running jumping and fast reactions
so and now you see how I deal with the

00:18:05.759 --> 00:18:05.769
so and now you see how I deal with the
 

00:18:05.769 --> 00:18:09.149
so and now you see how I deal with the
light and I give you some different

00:18:09.149 --> 00:18:09.159
light and I give you some different
 

00:18:09.159 --> 00:18:13.740
light and I give you some different
ideas how this giant phyto cast how I

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:13.750
ideas how this giant phyto cast how I
 

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:17.759
ideas how this giant phyto cast how I
looked like in different lighted

00:18:17.759 --> 00:18:17.769
looked like in different lighted
 

00:18:17.769 --> 00:18:21.120
looked like in different lighted
situations so we have some underwater

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:21.130
situations so we have some underwater
 

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:24.149
situations so we have some underwater
lights and above water light and and

00:18:24.149 --> 00:18:24.159
lights and above water light and and
 

00:18:24.159 --> 00:18:27.269
lights and above water light and and
effectively it was a quite misty day as

00:18:27.269 --> 00:18:27.279
effectively it was a quite misty day as
 

00:18:27.279 --> 00:18:31.190
effectively it was a quite misty day as
usual and quite tricky to get something

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200
usual and quite tricky to get something
 

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:36.659
usual and quite tricky to get something
and just that you get the relation on

00:18:36.659 --> 00:18:36.669
and just that you get the relation on
 

00:18:36.669 --> 00:18:41.789
and just that you get the relation on
top of this huge Tower of phyto cost

00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:41.799
top of this huge Tower of phyto cost
 

00:18:41.799 --> 00:18:45.350
top of this huge Tower of phyto cost
there standing a person it's just

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360
there standing a person it's just
 

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:49.379
there standing a person it's just
enormous as always always incredible to

00:18:49.379 --> 00:18:49.389
enormous as always always incredible to
 

00:18:49.389 --> 00:18:53.840
enormous as always always incredible to
realize these dimensions you know and

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:53.850
realize these dimensions you know and
 

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:56.580
realize these dimensions you know and
then we are walking through that gallery

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:56.590
then we are walking through that gallery
 

00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:02.039
then we are walking through that gallery
and we coming into this dim range of the

00:19:02.039 --> 00:19:02.049
and we coming into this dim range of the
 

00:19:02.049 --> 00:19:07.529
and we coming into this dim range of the
next of the next door line which is

00:19:07.529 --> 00:19:07.539
next of the next door line which is
 

00:19:07.539 --> 00:19:09.000
next of the next door line which is
called Garden of Eden

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:09.010
called Garden of Eden
 

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:12.930
called Garden of Eden
and also there we can see this low-light

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:12.940
and also there we can see this low-light
 

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:17.610
and also there we can see this low-light
formations with this vitacost formations

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:17.620
formations with this vitacost formations
 

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.760
formations with this vitacost formations
where some mosses and whatever grow

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:20.770
where some mosses and whatever grow
 

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:22.799
where some mosses and whatever grow
against the light

00:19:22.799 --> 00:19:22.809
against the light
 

00:19:22.809 --> 00:19:26.760
against the light
yeah very beautiful and the further you

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:26.770
yeah very beautiful and the further you
 

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:30.450
yeah very beautiful and the further you
get into that dole line the crazy of

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:30.460
get into that dole line the crazy of
 

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:34.440
get into that dole line the crazy of
these shapes get and here we see again

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:34.450
these shapes get and here we see again
 

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:39.450
these shapes get and here we see again
some microorganisms forming and growing

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:39.460
some microorganisms forming and growing
 

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:40.500
some microorganisms forming and growing
towards the light

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:40.510
towards the light
 

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:45.390
towards the light
here we see this whitish areas that is

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:45.400
here we see this whitish areas that is
 

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.120
here we see this whitish areas that is
where the microorganisms grow against

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:48.130
where the microorganisms grow against
 

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:51.210
where the microorganisms grow against
the light and that's the natural light

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:51.220
the light and that's the natural light
 

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.820
the light and that's the natural light
and then I I front lit the same

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:53.830
and then I I front lit the same
 

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.400
and then I I front lit the same
situation and you see now where the

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:56.410
situation and you see now where the
 

00:19:56.410 --> 00:20:00.090
situation and you see now where the
chlorophyll is and where the receptive

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:00.100
chlorophyll is and where the receptive
 

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:04.620
chlorophyll is and where the receptive
areas are for for photosynthesis here

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:04.630
areas are for for photosynthesis here
 

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:07.140
areas are for for photosynthesis here
the same in a detail it looks like the

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:07.150
the same in a detail it looks like the
 

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:08.250
the same in a detail it looks like the
surface of Mars

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:08.260
surface of Mars
 

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:12.090
surface of Mars
it looks so extraterrestrial that this

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:12.100
it looks so extraterrestrial that this
 

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.890
it looks so extraterrestrial that this
is done with natural light by the way

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:13.900
is done with natural light by the way
 

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:17.549
is done with natural light by the way
and if I add front light it looks like

00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:17.559
and if I add front light it looks like
 

00:20:17.559 --> 00:20:20.460
and if I add front light it looks like
that yeah it's a really really crazy

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:20.470
that yeah it's a really really crazy
 

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.610
that yeah it's a really really crazy
formation so I I love to explore this

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:23.620
formation so I I love to explore this
 

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.250
formation so I I love to explore this
type of things you know area why I have

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:26.260
type of things you know area why I have
 

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.590
type of things you know area why I have
never heard anything about it or seen

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:28.600
never heard anything about it or seen
 

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.690
never heard anything about it or seen
anything about it and you stumble about

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:30.700
anything about it and you stumble about
 

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:34.680
anything about it and you stumble about
this the beginning I couldn't believe it

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:34.690
this the beginning I couldn't believe it
 

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:37.230
this the beginning I couldn't believe it
I mean it was rock hard stem and there

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:37.240
I mean it was rock hard stem and there
 

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.620
I mean it was rock hard stem and there
was this little fan on top and it looks

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:40.630
was this little fan on top and it looks
 

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:44.220
was this little fan on top and it looks
like it's growing on pavement it's rock

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:44.230
like it's growing on pavement it's rock
 

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:46.320
like it's growing on pavement it's rock
everything is rock the stem is rock and

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:46.330
everything is rock the stem is rock and
 

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:47.730
everything is rock the stem is rock and
there is little green I mean it looks

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:47.740
there is little green I mean it looks
 

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.430
there is little green I mean it looks
like fossils like you really like the

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:50.440
like fossils like you really like the
 

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.210
like fossils like you really like the
Jurassic on but it's green on top and

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:53.220
Jurassic on but it's green on top and
 

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:57.020
Jurassic on but it's green on top and
it's not petrified it's living and

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:57.030
it's not petrified it's living and
 

00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:02.180
it's not petrified it's living and
obviously living very well there

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:02.190
 
 

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:05.070
 
yeah that's that's a relative to the

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.080
yeah that's that's a relative to the
 

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.310
yeah that's that's a relative to the
nettle to it's a boutique ax which is

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320
nettle to it's a boutique ax which is
 

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.620
nettle to it's a boutique ax which is
kind of strange because it doesn't look

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:10.630
kind of strange because it doesn't look
 

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:13.860
kind of strange because it doesn't look
at all similar and then you have this

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:13.870
at all similar and then you have this
 

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:18.630
at all similar and then you have this
communities so of in the phyto cars so

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640
communities so of in the phyto cars so
 

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.399
communities so of in the phyto cars so
all these different colors are light

00:21:20.399 --> 00:21:20.409
all these different colors are light
 

00:21:20.409 --> 00:21:21.990
all these different colors are light
green dark green

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000
green dark green
 

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.930
green dark green
redish that is all related to a

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:24.940
redish that is all related to a
 

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.540
redish that is all related to a
different micro organism and it would be

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:27.550
different micro organism and it would be
 

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:30.200
different micro organism and it would be
really nice to do a biological research

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:30.210
really nice to do a biological research
 

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:34.050
really nice to do a biological research
to determine what kind of organisms are

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:34.060
to determine what kind of organisms are
 

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.840
to determine what kind of organisms are
able to capable to do that and maybe it

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:36.850
able to capable to do that and maybe it
 

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:38.760
able to capable to do that and maybe it
would be interesting for science because

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:38.770
would be interesting for science because
 

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:41.070
would be interesting for science because
maybe they are very light receptive and

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:41.080
maybe they are very light receptive and
 

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.590
maybe they are very light receptive and
who knows what you can I don't know

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600
who knows what you can I don't know
 

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.420
who knows what you can I don't know
couldn't can use that so it would be

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:45.430
couldn't can use that so it would be
 

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:48.390
couldn't can use that so it would be
really nice to to do some more

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400
really nice to to do some more
 

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:54.270
really nice to to do some more
exploration there and this is how Garden

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:54.280
exploration there and this is how Garden
 

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.910
exploration there and this is how Garden
of edom looks like so we have a forest

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:56.920
of edom looks like so we have a forest
 

00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:00.470
of edom looks like so we have a forest
inside the cave which is incredible and

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480
inside the cave which is incredible and
 

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:06.330
inside the cave which is incredible and
we have this you try to cost yeah

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:06.340
we have this you try to cost yeah
 

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:10.260
we have this you try to cost yeah
stalagmites in front and then a jungle

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:10.270
stalagmites in front and then a jungle
 

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:16.110
stalagmites in front and then a jungle
it is kind of strange that we had a

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:16.120
it is kind of strange that we had a
 

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.570
it is kind of strange that we had a
botanist with us and he looked for maybe

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:18.580
botanist with us and he looked for maybe
 

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:21.860
botanist with us and he looked for maybe
new plants he couldn't find any but

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:21.870
new plants he couldn't find any but
 

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:26.310
new plants he couldn't find any but
every every plan is kind of informed in

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320
every every plan is kind of informed in
 

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.550
every every plan is kind of informed in
a different way so that's that's him

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:29.560
a different way so that's that's him
 

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.310
a different way so that's that's him
researching the plants and especially

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.320
researching the plants and especially
 

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.700
researching the plants and especially
the trees they grow slim they don't have

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:35.710
the trees they grow slim they don't have
 

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:39.750
the trees they grow slim they don't have
much light like above and they are tall

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760
much light like above and they are tall
 

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.780
much light like above and they are tall
maybe 100 feet tall but very slim and

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:42.790
maybe 100 feet tall but very slim and
 

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:47.870
maybe 100 feet tall but very slim and
and tender and it's it's a really well

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880
and tender and it's it's a really well
 

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.900
and tender and it's it's a really well
interesting environment which is kind of

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:51.910
interesting environment which is kind of
 

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:56.310
interesting environment which is kind of
different so they call it morphological

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320
different so they call it morphological
 

00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:02.150
different so they call it morphological
plasticity or phenotypic plasticity that

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:02.160
plasticity or phenotypic plasticity that
 

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:05.640
plasticity or phenotypic plasticity that
these plants shape different so it's not

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:05.650
these plants shape different so it's not
 

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.040
these plants shape different so it's not
genetically and this is a little

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:08.050
genetically and this is a little
 

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:11.760
genetically and this is a little
impactions with a little fruit fly on it

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:11.770
impactions with a little fruit fly on it
 

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:15.660
impactions with a little fruit fly on it
so even you find even flowers there it

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:15.670
so even you find even flowers there it
 

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:20.220
so even you find even flowers there it
was really overwhelming experience to

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:20.230
was really overwhelming experience to
 

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:23.030
was really overwhelming experience to
see that and to live in that time and

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:23.040
see that and to live in that time and
 

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:28.020
see that and to live in that time and
and also the way back there I mean when

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:28.030
and also the way back there I mean when
 

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:30.090
and also the way back there I mean when
it when it was night I mean we hear this

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:30.100
it when it was night I mean we hear this
 

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.310
it when it was night I mean we hear this
kind of strange noises it was a big flat

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320
kind of strange noises it was a big flat
 

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.470
kind of strange noises it was a big flat
and it was echoing everywhere it was

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:35.480
and it was echoing everywhere it was
 

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.560
and it was echoing everywhere it was
really loud for her we couldn't imagine

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:38.570
really loud for her we couldn't imagine
 

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:40.930
really loud for her we couldn't imagine
what it is I mean we would have thought

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:40.940
what it is I mean we would have thought
 

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.759
what it is I mean we would have thought
it's maybe a pterodactyl is like a

00:23:42.759 --> 00:23:42.769
it's maybe a pterodactyl is like a
 

00:23:42.769 --> 00:23:44.830
it's maybe a pterodactyl is like a
flying sorrows or something like that

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:44.840
flying sorrows or something like that
 

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.370
flying sorrows or something like that
but then we we thought maybe it's a big

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:48.380
but then we we thought maybe it's a big
 

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.649
but then we we thought maybe it's a big
old but we never saw it we always

00:23:50.649 --> 00:23:50.659
old but we never saw it we always
 

00:23:50.659 --> 00:23:52.840
old but we never saw it we always
listened to it and it sounded so loud

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:52.850
listened to it and it sounded so loud
 

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:55.749
listened to it and it sounded so loud
and so well you could imagine anything

00:23:55.749 --> 00:23:55.759
and so well you could imagine anything
 

00:23:55.759 --> 00:23:59.379
and so well you could imagine anything
to that so it was a very very very weird

00:23:59.379 --> 00:23:59.389
to that so it was a very very very weird
 

00:23:59.389 --> 00:24:02.669
to that so it was a very very very weird
environment and you yeah you are

00:24:02.669 --> 00:24:02.679
environment and you yeah you are
 

00:24:02.679 --> 00:24:08.289
environment and you yeah you are
yeah to me it was really yeah incredible

00:24:08.289 --> 00:24:08.299
yeah to me it was really yeah incredible
 

00:24:08.299 --> 00:24:13.210
yeah to me it was really yeah incredible
to witness that

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:13.220
 
 

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.310
 
the situation there in this shaft was

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:15.320
the situation there in this shaft was
 

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.649
the situation there in this shaft was
extraordinary sunlight was hitting the

00:24:17.649 --> 00:24:17.659
extraordinary sunlight was hitting the
 

00:24:17.659 --> 00:24:20.589
extraordinary sunlight was hitting the
ground it was humid and whole clouds

00:24:20.589 --> 00:24:20.599
ground it was humid and whole clouds
 

00:24:20.599 --> 00:24:24.339
ground it was humid and whole clouds
were rising and it was like climbing

00:24:24.339 --> 00:24:24.349
were rising and it was like climbing
 

00:24:24.349 --> 00:24:26.710
were rising and it was like climbing
through the skies climbing through the

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720
through the skies climbing through the
 

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.109
through the skies climbing through the
heaven and you are in midst of these

00:24:29.109 --> 00:24:29.119
heaven and you are in midst of these
 

00:24:29.119 --> 00:24:32.259
heaven and you are in midst of these
cloud formations that was really

00:24:32.259 --> 00:24:32.269
cloud formations that was really
 

00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:35.680
cloud formations that was really
something very very special and amazing

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:35.690
something very very special and amazing
 

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:40.589
something very very special and amazing
to me I mean you're like in midst well

00:24:40.589 --> 00:24:40.599
to me I mean you're like in midst well
 

00:24:40.599 --> 00:24:43.719
to me I mean you're like in midst well
in midst the heaven captured in a cave

00:24:43.719 --> 00:24:43.729
in midst the heaven captured in a cave
 

00:24:43.729 --> 00:24:49.139
in midst the heaven captured in a cave
so this was really unusual to just enjoy

00:24:49.139 --> 00:24:49.149
so this was really unusual to just enjoy
 

00:24:49.149 --> 00:24:51.940
so this was really unusual to just enjoy
and this is how you feel after a trip

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:51.950
and this is how you feel after a trip
 

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:52.599
and this is how you feel after a trip
like this

00:24:52.599 --> 00:24:52.609
like this
 

00:24:52.609 --> 00:24:56.799
like this
I mean you are worn out and everyone is

00:24:56.799 --> 00:24:56.809
I mean you are worn out and everyone is
 

00:24:56.809 --> 00:25:01.029
I mean you are worn out and everyone is
kind of done and and and these are the

00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.039
kind of done and and and these are the
 

00:25:01.039 --> 00:25:04.690
kind of done and and and these are the
real stars of our expedition the porters

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:04.700
real stars of our expedition the porters
 

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.210
real stars of our expedition the porters
they were amazing and without them it

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:07.220
they were amazing and without them it
 

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.249
they were amazing and without them it
would have been impossible and there is

00:25:09.249 --> 00:25:09.259
would have been impossible and there is
 

00:25:09.259 --> 00:25:11.349
would have been impossible and there is
a big thanks to them big thanks to

00:25:11.349 --> 00:25:11.359
a big thanks to them big thanks to
 

00:25:11.359 --> 00:25:14.219
a big thanks to them big thanks to
