00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:02.160
HAL VARIAN: OK.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.020
Well, I guess we should
get started.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.410
My task is to introduce
our speaker.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.760
Now I suppose it's theoretically
possible that

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.759
everybody just wandered into
this room by chance, expecting

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.030
that something interesting
might be happening.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.720
I don't know.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.460
What do you think, Nate?

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.420
Is that plausible?

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.045
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:26.160
NATE SILVER: You could
have herding, right?

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.870
A few people actually know
what they're doing, and

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.600
everything else kind
of follows along.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.580
HAL VARIAN: Yeah.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.540
It could be, but I'm guessing
that event has a relatively

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.610
low probability.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.610
So I'm guessing that most of
the people know who our

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.710
speaker is, and you
know his story.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.800
So I'm not going to
introduce him.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.446
I'm just going to turn
you over to Nate.

00:00:45.446 --> 00:00:52.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.730
NATE SILVER: Well, thank you.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.770
I'll spare you the kind of
wedding toast speech, and

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.170
we'll get to the questions
pretty soon.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.390
But it's a real honor to be
here at Google, in my view

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.010
probably the smartest company
in the world right now about

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.480
working with data and
using it to actually

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.520
transform people's lives.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.450
And I hope that some of what we
were able to accomplish--

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.360
and I tend to use "we" when I
mean "I" sometimes, right?

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.730
But I do see it as kind of
a collective project that

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.490
FiveThirtyEight is a part of, to
make journalism smarter, to

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.090
make political coverage better,
to just have people be

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.860
a little bit more data literate
and data savvy.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.880
And when that kind of hits into
the punditry, interesting

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.880
things, I guess, can
happen sometimes.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.775
But we have a lot of great
questions, it looks like, I

00:01:40.775 --> 00:01:42.410
think we'll leave time--
there'll be time for questions

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.590
at the end from people
in the room as well.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.350
So let's get started.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.420
HAL VARIAN: Absolutely.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.700
So we produced all these
questions using [INAUDIBLE],

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.580
so these are questions
submitted by

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.750
members of the audience.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.080
The techniques in
FiveThirtyEight's methodology

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.240
section were invented
ages ago.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.420
Someone could have done what you
were doing by at least the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.960
1990s or earlier.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.450
Why did it take the world so
long to produce and appreciate

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.521
Nate Silver?

00:02:06.521 --> 00:02:09.467
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:11.210
NATE SILVER: I was busy
playing poker.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.480
HAL VARIAN: Besides your mom.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.860
NATE SILVER: My mom, right?

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.190
No, if the Congress hadn't
basically banned internet

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.900
poker, then maybe I'd still
be doing that, right?

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.810
NATE SILVER: So in all
seriousness, though, it's only

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.210
been a few election cycles,
maybe the last four or five,

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.160
where you had as many state
polls as we do right now.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.650
And it's only been more recently
than that we can

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.700
really collect them pretty
easily on the internet, where

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.060
you do a Google News search or
you steal from Real Clear

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.600
Politics, or whatever else.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.150
But collecting all that data
and have it be essentially

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.220
free isn't something that's been
able to be true for all

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.590
that long, really.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.400
But also, I think people
are taking more of a

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.480
do-it-yourself mentality toward
aggregation and toward

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.600
producing content.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.680
When a news organization--

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.650
and the Times is
no exception--

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.500
produces a poll, they want
you think it's the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.120
only poll in the world.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.170
They don't fry the context of
well, this poll says that

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.420
Ronnie's ahead, by the other 12
polls say he's not, which

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.570
is what a reporter probably
should do.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.330
So you have, I think, some
perverse incentives in news

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.840
organizations who produce their
own polls-- which are

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.850
expensive, and I'm
a fan of good,

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.950
expensive telephone polling--

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.980
to pretend that no one else
is doing the same thing.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.260
And so I think that's
part of it.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.930
It kind of cuts against the
newsroom's first instinct.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.990
And part of it is that this is
actually a relatively new

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.250
thing, where you have so much
data available for free.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.930
HAL VARIAN: So right before
the election, the Romney

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.270
campaign claimed to be confident
that they would win.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.410
What was wrong with their
internal polling?

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.370
Why were the predictions
so far off?

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.400
Or were they just keeping a
straight face when they knew

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.340
defeat was coming?

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.140
NATE SILVER: Yeah, I think maybe
more-- well, there are

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.440
different layers of the Romney
organization, right?

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.300
And one question is, what did
Mitt Romney himself believe?

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.980
And I'm not sure about that.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.480
There's a question of, what did
Mitt Romney's pollsters

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.400
really believe?

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.750
And it's probably not
what they told the

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.380
press, exactly, right?

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.649
So I think there's some
culpability here where the

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:20.310
press is fed spin and bullshit,
basically, and then

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.520
they act surprised later on
when the bullshit in fact

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.466
turns out to be bullshit.

00:04:25.466 --> 00:04:27.460
And they blame the messenger,
when they should be blaming

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.350
themselves.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.290
Look, when campaign pollsters
talk to the press, they're not

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.040
trying to produce accurate
information.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.650
They're trying to put
things in the most

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.490
favorite light they can.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.610
I had very few conversations
with the campaigns.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.100
I try and avoid that,
almost go out of my

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.970
way to avoid that.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.580
But when I talked to the Romney
folks, they tended to

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.570
have a pretty realistic
view of what the

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.990
landscape looked like.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.510
Maybe it's because when they're
talking to me, then

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.960
I'm not going to go actually
report that.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.000
It's just kind of a friendly
on-background conversation, so

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.570
maybe you get less
spin and a little

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.920
bit more actual insight.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.580
But I think it's not
hard to tell--

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.230
it's hard for a campaign to
operate under the assumption

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.650
that it's probably
going to lose.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.680
Then it seems like it's
wasting its time.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.050
And so there are all kinds of
different biases that can

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.070
creep in, from confirmation bias
in the way you kind of

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.650
construct your samples, to
what news actually gets

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.250
reported to the candidate.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.400
I think any organization,
whether it's a political

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.330
campaign or anything else, if
you're an organization that

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.240
can do a reasonably good,
a recently honest

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.300
self-assessment,

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.010
that's a big Edge.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.960
That's why, by the way,
consultants make millions of

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.350
dollars per year.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.590
McKinsey or whatever else,
they're not really adding a

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:43.230
lot of value, necessarily.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.690
I'm sure they're very
smart people.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.210
But with the actual work
product, so much as they

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.520
provide mediation services to
resolve internal conflicts in

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.400
companies--

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.220
we can do politically incorrect
things if you hire

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.630
McKinsey to go in and say
something obvious, basically.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.690
NATE SILVER: So it's kind of the
same agency, probably, you

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.170
have, I think, in a political
campaign, where--

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.930
and by the way, one thing the
Obama campaign did in '08--

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.420
I'm not sure about
this years--

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.320
they had four or five different
pollsters that

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.350
worked independently from
one another, at

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.460
least to some degree.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.650
So they would have maybe the
same, two different pollsters

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.630
in-house survey Ohio.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.980
And then if you have a
difference of opinion in one

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:24.450
candidate--

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.280
one pollster might show a tie
in Ohio, and one might have

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.590
Obama up five--

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.800
then you can start to iron
that out, and those

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.850
discussions are often
productive.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.290
But within a campaign,
it can become

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.810
something quite insular.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.480
I think in general, people
overrate the value of the

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.770
campaign's internal polls.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.300
Even if you actually saw the
real internal polls-- which

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.780
you don't--

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.490
even then, I think, even though
some of the pollsters

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.130
are very smart, they're
operating under worse

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:54.250
incentives than you have
for a public pollster.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.010
It's hard to add value relative
to simple methods

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:59.930
with the extra things you might
do, and so if you have

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.300
bad incentives, then often that
leads to worse overall

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.430
results, even if you're a more
capable person in some

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.260
abstract sense.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.750
HAL VARIAN: Your remark reminds
me of the definition

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:10.490
of a consultant--

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.150
somebody who borrows your
watch to tell you

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.800
what time it is.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.220
NATE SILVER: Exactly.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.650
HAL VARIAN: So probability
is hard to

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.250
grasp for the layperson.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.230
So what do you think the best
way is to visualize the

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.280
prediction data?

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.290
NATE SILVER: I think if you have
something which is like

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.480
geographical data-- so the
National Weather Service

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.120
actually has worked on this
problem a lot with its

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:33.900
hurricane forecast.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.680
If you can actually show
people the "cone of

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.810
uncertainty," as they call it,
then they gradually come to

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.840
understand what that means.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.760
They've also kind of worked
on problems like how much

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.520
uncertainty do you want
to show in that cone.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.860
If you show the 90% confidence
interval, in essence, it would

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.990
still be very, very wide.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.440
If you show the 50% confidence
interval, well, it's kind of

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.970
useful, but you're going
to be outside that

00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:59.330
range half the time.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.030
They kind of settled by trial
and error on showing 2/3 the

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.600
possible outcomes.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.670
But probability, it is something
where you can say

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.650
all the time that well, this
kind of has an 80% chance of

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.940
winning, and it's a
straightforward, kind of

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.900
objective statement.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.330
But people don't really grasp
what that means, exactly.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.310
That's why I say, having played
poker, it comes more

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.410
naturally to me.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.500
Because you know that if your
opponent has to catch a flush

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.830
with one card to come, he'll
make his hand 20% of the time.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:32.870
You'll win 80% of time.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.860
But believe me, you've played
plenty of hands, and you know,

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.710
you take those bad beats
20% of the time.

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:38.440
You know what it feels like.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.429
You busted out of tournaments
or lost a lot of money on

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:42.000
those hands.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.810
So you're very aware of
what 80-20 really

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:45.680
kind of feels like.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.630
I think that's harder for
people when they're not

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.530
encountering probability
on a day-to-day basis.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.383
I think in general, the news
media has a tough time, and

00:08:54.383 --> 00:08:56.090
maybe people in general
have a tough time--

00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:00.070
everything is either
50-50 or 100-0.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:03.490
It's either, oh, too close to
call, or it's like, we're sure

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:04.020
what's going to happen.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.400
It'd be a shock if anything
else transpired.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.640
When usually we're operating
on the margins here.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.600
And if you guys are
engineers--

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.626
I know some of you
probably are--

00:09:15.626 --> 00:09:18.060
you know when you're building
a program, you're making

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.090
little incremental improvements
most the time.

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.710
More often, you have
this a-ha moment.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.280
You're debugging things
and you're making

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.180
these marginal gains.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.950
And that kind of process doesn't
necessarily make for

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:34.960
great stories, necessarily.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.700
And so that also clashes with
the way that the campaigns

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.240
tend to be covered.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.920
HAL VARIAN: I just read a
review of a new textbook

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.530
called "Introduction to
Probability and Statistics

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:46.570
Using Texas Hold 'em."

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:47.850
NATE SILVER: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:48.700
HAL VARIAN: True story.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:49.400
True story.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.980
So maybe literacy will
increase, if we

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:52.770
get the right materials.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:56.120
NATE SILVER: Well, I know some
investment banks and hedge

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.220
funds are now training their
people by having them play

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.940
Texas Hold 'em.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.340
Somehow that attitude, and
the instinct to take new

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.820
information that you
perceive and have a

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.080
better first judgment--

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.800
I met a guy who says, oh, don't
do the Malcolm Gladwell

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.610
"Blink" thing.

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:14.800
You want to think through
problems, think a little bit

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.890
more slowly.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:19.340
At the same time, to have a
better first cut when you

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:23.090
encounter a new piece of data,
a better first instinct,

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.820
whether that's meaningful or
not, whether it should change

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.600
your summation of a problem or
not, that's helpful as well.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.700
And poker is a very game
for developing

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.660
that skill, I think.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.080
HAL VARIAN: So as you and your
model gain renown and

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.970
credibility, how will your
forecast affect the very

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.330
events they aim to predict?

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.150
And how can you adjust for
this in your model?

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.120
NATE SILVER: Well, I was talking
with some people over

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.930
lunch, and it's going to be a
problem that you guys might

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:52.160
encounter as well, where because
Google a itself is so

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.430
influential on what people
identify and maybe what trends

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:59.160
go viral, then it becomes a
very challenging problem,

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.760
potentially.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.360
I would hope that we
didn't influence

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.160
people all that much.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.930
It worries me maybe a little bit
more in something like a

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:12.330
primary campaign, where voters
are being more tactical, if

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.510
you have to pick between
five or six options.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.600
There's some evidence, by the
way, this worked toward Rick

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.050
Santorum's benefit in the Iowa
caucus, where you basically

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:22.140
had three interchangeable
candidates, more or less,

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.480
Bachmann, Perry, and Santorum,
who were all

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.550
polling at about 10%.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.410
That's kind of an inefficient
outcome, where people who

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:34.690
would want Bachmann to win the
Iowa caucus for some reason

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:37.080
would probably be happy
with Santorum as well.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.780
So once one candidate had any
edge, you saw a lot of

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.045
tactical shifting.

00:11:41.045 --> 00:11:42.900
And in this case, there was
some CNN poll that was

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.130
published that had
Santorum gaining.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:45.900
It could've been real.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.510
It could have been a
[INAUDIBLE] fluke.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.430
But that gave him momentum,
and then people joined the

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.570
bandwagon, and the surge became
a self-fulfilling

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:55.150
prophecy after a while.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:58.310
In general elections, where you
have just two parties, you

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:00.620
have less of that tactical
behavior.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.810
So I'm not as worried about
it, I don't think.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:07.900
There can be things, though,
like when we had US House

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.430
Forecast in 2010--

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.810
we'll do it again in 2014--

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:13.840
there are scarce resources.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.350
So if you give a candidate only
a 5% chance of winning,

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:21.250
then maybe her congressional
committee won't fund her as

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.520
much as another candidate.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.760
And so that can be
complicated.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.740
Or when we do things like say,
well, here's the optimal

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.630
allocation of resources between
different states.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.520
We had a return on
investment index.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.660
Implicitly, that kind of assumes
that the campaigns are

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.070
behaving the way they
have in the past.

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:43.570
It's kind of like, sort of
like the Lucas critique,

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:49.250
almost, in economics, where
you're modeling things based

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:52.480
on past data, but you're
implicitly accounting for

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.130
decision-making of past
policymakers.

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.560
So the extent to which certain
states might move relative to

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.000
other states implicitly includes
the assumption that

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.870
campaigns were making before.

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:05.240
And if they change the way
they behave, maybe target

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.130
particular states differently
than they did in the past,

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.820
then you have some structural
uncertainty in the problem.

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.330
So these things are really
complicated, and they kind of

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:14.880
keep you up late at night.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.040
I think they're one reason, in
general, to when you are

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.670
making a choices, as far as
specifying a confidence

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:25.670
interval, to err on the side of
including more uncertainty

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.000
rather than less.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.540
Although you can have the
reverse case, where if you

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.020
have a self-fulfilling prophecy,
then you can be

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.770
accurate, just because that's
what you predict is going to

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:36.630
happen, and lo and
behold, it does.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:41.180
I did some work for a movie
studio a couple of years ago.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.960
And they had a belief in their
culture that some particular

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.370
random day-- say, the first
weekend in October--

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:49.560
was a very good time
to release a movie.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.040
I think they had had some movie
that just had a good

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.350
script one year, was a
well-directed movie that did

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:55.740
well in that slot.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.660
So every year thereafter, they'd
put some breakout film

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:02.670
in that October 7 slot, let's
call it, and because they

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:03.900
believed it was going to do
well, they'd pump a lot of

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.540
marketing budget behind it.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.390
And lo and behold,
it did do well.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:08.085
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:08.085 --> 00:14:10.020
So this became more are more
entrenched, and they seemed

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:13.200
very, very smart, because they
predicted that every year this

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:13.750
film would be successful.

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.940
But of course if you pick one
of your better films and put

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.340
lots and lots of marketing
muscle behind

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:18.140
it, then it'll work.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.210
It has nothing to do with the
date on which it's released.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:22.740
HAL VARIAN: Yes, we see
this at Google.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.380
I talked to an advertiser
once who said, I know my

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.690
advertising works because I
increase my expenditure every

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.055
December, and what do you
know, my sales go up.

00:14:31.055 --> 00:14:33.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:37.010
HAL VARIAN: So what do you
think is the best way to

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.990
evaluate the performance of
forecasters who are computing

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:42.190
probability estimates
for discrete events?

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:45.460
And in particular, what if
these events are rare?

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.880
NATE SILVER: If they're
rare, it's tough.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.860
If they're common, then
calibration, in my view, is

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:54.420
the best test, meaning of the
things you say will happen 80%

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.960
of the time, do they happen
80% of the time?

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.433
And it's problematic if they
happen half the time, but also

00:15:00.433 --> 00:15:02.920
if they happen 100%
of the time.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:07.200
People don't realize that if
you make these 80-20 calls,

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.630
you're supposed to get that
wrong 20% of the time, of

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.480
you're doing something wrong.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.080
You're being underconfident,
I guess.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.040
And sometimes we've been
accused of being too

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.610
conservative in the confidence
intervals that we specify.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.610
But there are also
cases where--

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.150
the Senate candidate in North
Dakota, Heidi Heitkamp, we had

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:28.260
her with only an 8% chance
of winning, and she did.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.375
I think we had Rick Santorum
with a 3% chance of winning

00:15:31.375 --> 00:15:34.080
the Iowa caucus at one point
before his surge, or a 2%

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.540
chance, and he did.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.750
So we look at that over
the long run.

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.550
But over the short run,
then you have to be--

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:42.650
I don't know.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:47.000
I mean, if you don't have a
large enough sample size to

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.690
test things truly at a sample,
then yeah, there aren't any

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.780
great substitutes for it.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.570
And I tended to fall more
to, I guess I call

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:56.760
them Bayesian priors.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.970
But to think, does the structure
of this model make a

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:01.840
lot of sense?

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.530
You can make inferences.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:04.520
One thing I found helpful in
writing my book is that you

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:09.330
talk about forecasting practices
in different fields,

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:12.040
and so you can learn implicitly
from that.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.930
Well, here are some good
principles that generally

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:17.190
produce more reliable
forecasts.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.310
So by following those
guidelines--

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:23.710
and if you are, then having one
additional case might not

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:27.020
tell you all that much,
necessarily.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.970
If you have 100 additional cases
or 1,000, then sure, it

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.780
tells you an awful lot.

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.270
And one thing that Google gets
to do, is because you guys can

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:37.650
kind of collect data on demand,
basically, from

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:42.230
billions of users, here, you
can solve a lot of things

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.630
through trial and error.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:47.120
And if you have that much data,
then that is probably

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.460
the better way to do
it, more kind of

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.110
a brute force approach.

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:55.490
But I think people aren't
sensitive enough to how much

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.760
your whole attitude and approach
should change when

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.300
you're in an environment
that isn't data-rich.

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.140
You almost have to do some of
the opposite things, really, I

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.560
think, in and not be overly
fixated on how

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.720
any one result goes.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.720
But it's tricky for people.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.270
HAL VARIAN: So tell us about
your tech set-up and workflow.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:16.270
So what programming and stats
languages do you use?

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:19.010
And one question I know this
audience wants to know is, do

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:20.890
you work in a cubicle with
three other people?

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:24.520
HAL VARIAN: Do you get
free massages?

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.040
NATE SILVER: I do not
free massages.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.080
The food at "The New York Times"
cafeteria is not as

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.820
good as the food at the
Google cafeteria.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:37.750
So I don't really have as much
of a routine as a lot of

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:41.380
people do, in part because I
go through different phases

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.470
where I'm traveling a lot or
writing the book or promoting

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:46.360
the book or doing media or not
doing media, or working on a

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.330
model, or going to the office.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:51.610
So there's not really a
routine all that much.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:56.330
I do have a desk at the "Times"
which is shared with

00:17:56.330 --> 00:18:01.740
Micah Cohen, also
of the 538 blog.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.820
But I go in probably two or
three times a week if I have

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.020
something else to do in Midtown,
otherwise not.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.260
I find it hard, actually,
to do writing

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.720
when you're in a newsroom.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.290
To write, I need total quiet
or music playing.

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:20.560
But I think writing is the
thing that requires more

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.390
concentration than
anything else.

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:23.790
Although programming, also--

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.360
I'm not a very good programmer,
so when actually

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:31.480
have to program the Staticode,
that requires a lot of effort.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.500
And for that stuff, I
think you need some

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.660
silence and some quiet.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.190
Where offices are a
great place to go

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:38.370
to socialize, right?

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.470
But I think for some types of
tasks, you need to think on

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:44.380
your own as well.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:45.730
But my set-up's not
very advanced.

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:49.680
I have an ASUS laptop, which I
need to replace because it's

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.220
basically falling
apart right now.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:57.280
I use Stata for most stuff
and Microsoft Excel.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.890
I used to try to do everything
in Excel, and that kind of was

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:01.525
a bad idea.

00:19:01.525 --> 00:19:05.360
I mean, Excel's not
a bad program.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.710
It's a pretty good program.

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:10.460
You can kind of think of it as a
visual programming language.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:15.390
But in 2008, it took like two
hours to actually run the

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.170
model on Excel, because
it was so slow.

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.910
Now you can do it in about five
minutes, and I'm sure you

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.440
could get it down to a minute
and a half, if I were a more

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.870
competent Stata programmer.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:28.780
But to have some kind
of code is helpful.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:29.680
HAL VARIAN: What's the next
thing you want to

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.360
learn in this area?

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.703
The tools area.

00:19:32.703 --> 00:19:33.490
NATE SILVER: I don't know.

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.880
I mean, maybe R. But it's
hard, you know--

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.026
HAL VARIAN: That's
a good answer.

00:19:38.026 --> 00:19:40.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:41.940
NATE SILVER: The switching
cost is pretty high.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:47.090
When you're use to having the 15
Stata commands that I know,

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:49.820
I know how to make them do
anything in ways that are

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:53.850
probably really inefficient
in some sense.

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:55.140
But it's hard to switch.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.360
But it might be good to
go to R or something.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.120
I think that would be the one
that would make the most

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.390
sense, I would think.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:03.820
HAL VARIAN: So what's the most
statistically unsound tactic

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.230
in professional sports?

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:08.230
NATE SILVER: Well, I think in
terms of being something which

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:13.040
is routinely done badly, and
which costs teams quite a bit

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.710
of win expectation, is the way
that NFL teams operates on

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:18.820
fourth down.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:22.210
They punt way too much, and to
a lesser extent, go for field

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:24.990
goals instead of going for it
more often than they should.

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:27.480
I've always found this ironic,
by the way, because the good,

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.740
masculine thing to do would be
to keep your offense on the

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.850
field and go for
it more, right?

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:36.940
You'd think the bias would
almost work the other way.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:37.710
But it doesn't.

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.470
Teams punt way too often.

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:42.220
They're much too risk-averse.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.420
The announcers tend to be really
punitive to a guy when

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:47.390
he decides to go for it.

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:50.980
Basically on fourth and two or
fourth and one, you should be

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.730
going for it almost all the
time, unless you're deep in

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:57.640
your own territory and you
have a big lead already.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:01.380
But you know, but your
incentives, again, become

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.620
distorted, where if you go for
it and the quarterback that

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:07.455
sacked or something, you'll
come in for a lot of heat,

00:21:07.455 --> 00:21:10.070
when the normal thing to do is
to punt, and so you don't risk

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.850
as much there.

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:12.560
But there are some teams--

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.940
the Patriots are very
good about how

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.430
they manage that stuff.

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:19.940
And those decisions are worth
about half a win per year.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:24.600
Which doesn't sound like much,
but over a 16-game schedule,

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.090
that's worth quite a bit.

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:29.010
It's worth basically millions
and millions of dollars, if

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.580
you look for the price
that an NFL team pays

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.790
for a marginal win.

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:37.330
And just based on reading this
literature and keeping your

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:40.010
offense on the field more,
it should be fun.

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:43.370
But teams have screwed that
up for years now.

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.370
HAL VARIAN: This is the
Paul Romer find.

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:46.287
NATE SILVER: The Paul
Romer paper.

00:21:46.287 --> 00:21:46.960
Yeah, yeah.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.740
He was the one who found that
it's actually half a win a

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.416
year, just based on this one
type of decision, which will

00:21:53.416 --> 00:21:56.450
come up three or four
times in a game.

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:59.680
But it's a odd that so
few teams have done

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.930
that reading, I suppose.

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.530
HAL VARIAN: They don't read
the "Journal of Political

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:07.180
Economy," for some reason.

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:08.270
NATE SILVER: No, they-- yeah.

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:10.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:12.600
HAL VARIAN: So in the North
Dakota and Montana Senate

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.590
races, which your algorithm got
wrong, you excluded polls

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:17.200
that turned out to
be accurate.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.670
So what went wrong, and do you
plan to make any changes in

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:21.360
the future?

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:26.170
NATE SILVER: So I guess in the
North Dakota case, the Heidi

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:28.570
Heitkamp campaign-- she was the
Democrat in that race--

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:32.550
released polls that
had her ahead.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:36.150
And usually, internal polls
exaggerate a little bit,

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:38.120
although the rule is kind of
like, if you're actually

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.620
winning, you don't need to
lie in the internal poll.

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.160
If you're losing,
though, you do.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.930
So you kind of have
these asymmetries.

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.280
Some people said the fact that
she was releasing polls and

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.300
her opponent wasn't
was interesting.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.730
But in general, we
don't use polls

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:50.670
released by the campaigns.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.570
We think in the long run-- for
example, in the Wisconsin

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:57.550
recall election earlier this
year, you had a number of

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:00.540
polls released by Democratic
groups that had the race tied,

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.680
whereas the public polls had
Scott Walker up by six.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.880
And Scott Walker won by
six, pretty much.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.860
And so that's the case
more often than not.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.380
But North Dakota was a case
where the model, if it doesn't

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.800
have polls, it defaults
to what we call state

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.660
fundamentals, which means that
hey, it's North Dakota.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:19.220
The Republican will
probably win.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:20.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.020
NATE SILVER: And so there wasn't
very much polling data

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.710
at all, so it gave the
fundamentals a

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:27.410
fairly heavy weight.

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:33.060
And I don't know, I think it's
a well-designed, sensible

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.060
model, basically.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:37.480
Although that was a case where
people who were using the

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.850
Heitkamp internal polls
often got the right

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:42.720
call, and we did not.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.260
But I'm willing to
live with that.

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.350
I mean, one other thing, too,
was that we modeled that, we

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.880
calibrated it based on how well
polls have done since

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.390
1990, looking back on every
Senate race since 1990.

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:56.230
And it's not like the
fundamentals calculations are

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:59.640
perfect, but the polls are
also often pretty bad in

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:03.010
Senate races, so it helps
to hedge your bets

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:03.900
a little bit more.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.620
If it's true that the polls are
on a secular trend toward

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.760
becoming more accurate,
then you could trust

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.640
the polls even more.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.570
I'm still a little bit skeptical
that polls are

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:17.810
really on a long-term upward
trend, when it's becoming

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:20.500
harder and harder to reach
people on the phone.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.680
Internet polls, including
Google's, had a pretty good

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.920
year this year.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.940
But so, I don't know.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.840
Look, we're going to have some
year where the polls do bad,

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.220
probably, and someone will look
really smart for saying,

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.080
don't trust the polls.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:40.300
I mean, frankly, the polls in
the GOP primaries this year

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:43.790
were a pretty wild ride.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.970
But look, if the polls are
right, then just trust the

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:47.130
polls, and you'll
do pretty well.

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:51.640
It's hard to add, necessarily, a
ton of value on top of that.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.140
HAL VARIAN: So 538 is
exceedingly transparent about

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:57.520
its processes and inputs,
but it's not 100% open.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.195
Is there any path to being able
to open up the source or

00:25:00.195 --> 00:25:02.320
allow others to run simulations
as well, or is

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.630
that not in the cards?

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:05.730
NATE SILVER: So there
are kind of three

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.010
different levels here.

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:11.210
One is the level of transparency
that we have in

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:14.530
practice, where things are
described very fully, and I

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:16.440
think there's room--

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:20.770
so sometimes you'll have, say
the academic standard is maybe

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:23.700
you release your source code and
all your data, and there's

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.260
a lot to be said for that.

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:29.060
I think it's also important,
though, to explain not just

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:32.170
what you're doing, but
why you're doing it.

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:34.650
You might have a fully-specified
model that's

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:38.740
publicly available but that's
also a terribly designed

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:42.000
model, an overfit regression
model or something that

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.090
doesn't make any sense, or
makes very questionable

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:45.680
assumptions.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.080
So the fact that we're kind of
walking and talking through

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.120
the model and explaining why
we made the choices that we

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.090
did, I think, is helpful.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:57.210
With that said, I would ideally
like to have fuller--

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:01.120
not complete, but more
transparency, and more formal

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.630
language describing
what we're doing.

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:06.370
Part of what happens is that
writing these articles that

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:09.930
are methodologically based
take a lot of time right.

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:13.180
And so I have an aspiration to
have a lot of this basically,

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:17.630
a 10,000 word article that
describes the FiveThirtyEight

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:19.560
model more fully, and then
there's some breaking news

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:24.710
story, Sanders makes some joke
about rape or something, and

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:26.600
you wind up covering that and
not catching up with the

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.620
methodological stuff.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:31.030
But I would like to move toward
a place where we have

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:33.920
more disclosure and transparency
and it's fairly

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.160
explicit, and yes, people
can reverse-engineer it.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.620
I don't think we're literally
going to release source code.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.580
It is a proprietary product.

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.970
One thing I have, is because I
license it to "The New York

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:48.240
Times," if you release that
source code, then I'm paying

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.370
out of pocket, in essence, in
terms of when I next have the

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:52.080
deal come up.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.220
But the idea is not really to
hide anything, and I've always

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:56.140
answered all questions
about them all.

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:58.280
I just don't want to quite make
it literally so easy so

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.880
someone can run the source
code and permute it

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.310
themselves.

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:06.020
You also have this perverse
thing, and maybe you guys have

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:09.110
experienced this, different
teams here, where sometimes

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:11.410
when you disclose more,
it won't shut

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:14.320
up the trolls, basically.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:14.820
It won't.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.760
They'll just find other things,
other little details

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.450
to nitpick.

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:21.990
So I think it just means,
what's your own kind of

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.550
ethical practice?

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:25.310
As far as, just so
you're clear--

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:27.230
if you disclose things more
fully, you're like, well, you

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:29.960
guys know how this is working,
you guys know that I'm not

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.360
manipulating these numbers.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:35.480
Like some people thought that we
actually go in and manually

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.460
give a weight to every poll,
where'd I go, here's "We Ask

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:40.650
America" poll in Nebraska.

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:43.000
1.23653.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.780
Or just making up these long
numbers arbitrarily.

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:48.770
Whereas no, it's all done
algorithmically.

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:50.070
But I think things
could have been a

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:52.260
little bit better explained.

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:54.310
I would strive to do more
of that going forward.

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:57.260
But you do have to kind
of carve out time,

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.330
I think, for that.

00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:00.220
And one thing also-- sorry, I'm
kind of giving long-winded

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.460
answers here.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:06.220
But we're also hoping that by
the next election, I'll have a

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.780
bigger team around
FiveThirtyEight.

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.320
I mean it really is, we have
great interactive graphics

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.920
people at "The Times" and great
editors and so forth,

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.550
but in terms of content
producers, it really is just

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:18.610
me and Micah.

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:20.480
There was not a big
FiveThirtyEight team.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.660
And the "Times" understand that
the 538 team needs to

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.560
grow, or if I go somewhere
else, then

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:27.990
probably the same thing.

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:30.990
But so that'll be different,
I think, next year.

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:36.000
But a lot of it just is, like,
well, I ran out of time to do

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.540
things I would otherwise
want to do.

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:41.590
HAL VARIAN: So on this
methodological point, what do

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:44.930
you think about market
approaches, political stock

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:47.505
markets, like the Iowa
Electronic Market or Intrade,

00:28:47.505 --> 00:28:50.850
or these other cases where
you're looking, basically, at

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:54.030
crowdsourcing the forecasts?

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:58.970
NATE SILVER: So look, in
general, I think that markets

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:04.850
are the least worst solution,
a lot of the time.

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:05.150
Very often.

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:07.070
It doesn't mean they're
perfect, though.

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:09.710
I think there is a question
of, how informed is the

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:14.590
average trader at Intrade,
for example?

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:17.000
And by the way, the government
decided, the CFTC decided to

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.316
sue Intrade today.

00:29:19.316 --> 00:29:20.130
HAL VARIAN: Oh.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:21.580
NATE SILVER: I'm not sure that's
really the best use of

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:24.100
taxpayer dollars.

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.770
So that could be an interesting
development.

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:31.970
But I think that sophisticated
political observers could

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:34.000
probably beat Intrade.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.110
I'm not sure they could, though,
if they were more real

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:39.690
money on the line,
I guess I'd say.

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:42.970
I don't mean to sound totally
pejorative or anything.

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:45.630
But look, if you really had
a good play, if you really

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:47.860
thought you had a good model
of the election, then you

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:50.850
wouldn't be betting for a few
thousand bucks on Intrade.

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:53.320
You be instead, rather, working
at a hedge fund,

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.000
developing a portfolio.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.830
It's pretty clear that, for
example, coal stocks were

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:03.310
correlated with Romney's chance
of winning at Intrade.

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:05.560
Or green energy stocks were
correlated, conversely, with

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.695
Obama's chance of winning,
or different types

00:30:07.695 --> 00:30:08.550
of health care stocks.

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:10.750
There are enough companies where
the have predictable

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:12.080
enough economic affects on the
election, where even if you

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:15.580
have some fuzziness in building
your portfolio, you

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.470
can make a lot more that
way, potentially.

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:21.530
But the other question is, you
can always have herding in

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:24.480
markets, where you have the
blind leading the blind,

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.140
potentially.

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:30.040
I think there were times at the
end of the election where

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.860
there were some odd activity
on Intrade, where Romney's

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:36.330
price would shift a lot with
no real reason in the

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:37.030
fundamentals.

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:41.630
There were some theories that
you had wealthy Republicans or

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:43.690
whatever, conservatives, kind
of buying these shares to

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:47.100
influence the way the race
was covered by the media.

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:50.550
And you had divergences where
in Intrade, Romney might be

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:54.130
priced with a 35% chance of
winning, but at other markets,

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:58.220
he'd have a 15% chance or 20%
chance, really big spreads

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:01.600
that are not consistent with
highly rational behaviors.

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.585
So you have this kind of
abstract question of, what if

00:31:03.585 --> 00:31:08.490
you really had a highly liquid
stock market or prediction

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:10.330
market, how well
would that do?

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:13.610
Then you have the question of,
well, how well does Intrade do

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:17.390
in practice, given the
constraints it has on people

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:20.260
depositing money and
the lack of volume?

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.340
And I think the answer
is that it's useful.

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:26.340
It's a lot better than the
pundits, for example.

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:30.040
But I think once people
start to invest it

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.480
with godlike power--

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.540
like, oh, it's the market, it
must be right-- that's exactly

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:35.080
when markets fail.

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.870
It's when you think markets are
infallible that markets

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:40.210
become much less useful tools.

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:43.170
HAL VARIAN: So can you put
historical polls in your model

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:47.780
and simulate the predictions,
from 2000, 2004, et cetera?

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:50.870
And it would be nice to know if
the elections are ever as

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:54.250
close as the pundits say.

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:57.010
NATE SILVER: Well, I think at
the end of the campaign, both

00:31:57.010 --> 00:32:02.360
the 2000 and 2004 elections
would have been closer.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.620
But remember, in 2008, on the
weekend before the election,

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.700
the McLaughlin Group, they asked
their panel, who's going

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:11.210
to win the election
next Tuesday?

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:13.070
And three of the four panelists
said it was too

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:14.330
close to call.

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:17.090
And in 2008, this wasn't
even debatable.

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:19.980
Obama was up by 7 points in
every single poll in every

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.120
single swing state.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.960
I mean, just no excuse for that
at all, if you're not

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.230
just constantly trafficking
in bullshit, basically.

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:29.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:31.440
NATE SILVER: So you know, the
fact that in 2012, you met

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.340
some resistance, it shouldn't
have been surprising, exactly.

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:34.880
I'm not sure.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.410
You know, in 1984, there'd
probably be some columnists

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:39.030
saying, well, Walter Mondale,
don't count

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:39.570
Walter Mondale out.

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:41.306
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:41.306 --> 00:32:42.150
NATE SILVER: People
haven't voted yet.

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:42.750
Anything could happen.

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:45.240
We're hearing reports of more
yard signs in Roanoke.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:48.315
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:48.315 --> 00:32:49.720
NATE SILVER: But there's always
going to make the

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.890
contrarian argument, and it's
hard for people to kind of

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:56.090
accept, I think, reality,
in some sense, for

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:57.600
the end of a campaign.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.650
HAL VARIAN: So let's switch
to a sports question.

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:02.060
Coaches and managers are
generally judged by how many

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:04.610
games are won and whether or
not they win championships.

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:07.690
Do you believe there will be
a reliable way to measure

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:12.400
coaching performance from
a game-to-game basis.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.040
NATE SILVER: It's tricky.

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.620
I mean, in the NFL, maybe you
can do a little bit more with

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:18.100
those play-calling things
I talked about.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:23.940
But I do think that one bias
that stat-heads sometimes have

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:26.410
is to assume that if you can't
measure something easily, that

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:28.550
it isn't important.

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:32.120
Hypothetically, if you had a
baseball manager who got his

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:36.200
players to perform 5% better
than they otherwise would--

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.000
and how do you define 5%?

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.520
I'm not sure.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.320
Either it was because they're
better rested or you have a

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:46.730
better clubhouse environment
or anything else.

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:48.400
Then that would be extremely
valuable, and that would

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:52.300
outweigh the cost of laying down
too many sacrifice bunts

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:53.740
or whatever else.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.630
Now can you measure that?

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:58.540
It would probably
be pretty hard.

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:00.280
You have too many degrees of
freedom in the problem to

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.520
really pin anything down
in a more reliable way.

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:07.280
But you know, both baseball
teams and basketball teams, I

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:10.190
think, have learned, for
example, that as it's become

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:13.060
easier to measure defensive
contributions from individual

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:16.030
players, that they were probably
underrating defense,

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:17.260
if anything.

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.980
Maybe stat-heads
in particular--

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:23.530
Billy Beane's earliest kind
of mid-'90s ace teams had

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:25.710
terrible defensive outfields,
because you couldn't measure

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:27.280
it, and so it was kind
of assumed that

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.690
oh, it doesn't matter.

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:32.610
But when you had Matt Stairs
playing center field or

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:35.080
something, that created
big problems.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:38.179
And so they kind of learned the
hard way that you had to

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:39.590
try and measures this
stuff and gain some

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:41.020
advantage from that.

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.429
But I think there could be
coaches that make more of a

00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:44.739
difference.

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:47.860
It seems certainly, if you look
at, for example, college

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:51.790
basketball programs, that a
coach can be hugely valuable.

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:53.899
That gets tied into recruiting
and everything else.

00:34:53.899 --> 00:34:56.170
So it's hard to say.

00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:57.840
But I don't know.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:01.650
So are we ever going to be able
to have a coach metric?

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:03.940
Probably not, unfortunately.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:06.310
It's a hard problem
to address.

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:09.780
But that doesn't mean their
value should be dismissed

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:11.760
out-of-hand, I think.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.450
HAL VARIAN: So which past
elections in the modern era

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:19.040
would you most want to apply
your methods to, and why?

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.950
Range over time and
space here.

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:25.295
NATE SILVER: I think it would be
fun to apply your method to

00:35:25.295 --> 00:35:29.240
an election that had three
viable candidates.

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:32.390
The 1992 election, that close
to the end would have been a

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:33.255
lot of fun, potentially.

00:35:33.255 --> 00:35:36.450
Although also, the variance
is much higher in a

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:37.350
three-candidate race.

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:39.700
A lot more [INAUDIBLE] things
can happen, so you could wind

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.510
up with more egg on your face.

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:45.780
But yeah, that would be the
fantasy scenario, is to deal

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:48.595
with an election where you had
three viable candidates and

00:35:48.595 --> 00:35:51.630
you states that could shift
between blue and red and

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:54.150
green, and that would be fun.

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:55.410
HAL VARIAN: Have you thought
about looking at

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:56.335
parliamentary elections?

00:35:56.335 --> 00:35:58.480
NATE SILVER: Well, I tried this
for the UK, and our model

00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.580
kind of sucked, actually.

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.550
NATE SILVER: Look, Cleggmania
wore off, and the model was

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:07.440
really bullish on Nick Clegg.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:10.400
But that's also a case where
in the UK, you don't have a

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.760
lot of district-by-district
polls.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.790
So you basically have
national polls--

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:19.150
imagine if we only had national
polls in the US, and

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:21.600
then you had to infer from
that what the electoral

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.510
college would look like.

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:28.480
Any assumption you make is going
to be potentially crude,

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.590
or it's going to be crude
and potentially flawed.

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:32.610
And that's kind of what you
had to do in the UK.

00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:35.185
So that, plus the fact that you
did have three parties,

00:36:35.185 --> 00:36:37.980
and you did have strategic
behavior at the end, where the

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:41.360
Liberal Democrat voters were
basically, more of them were

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.920
Labour voters than Conservative
voters.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:49.510
And so when Cleggmania, when
that bubble burst, then Labour

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:52.510
overperformed our predictions
there.

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:53.720
But it is interesting.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:58.620
Look, anything can be modeled,
as long as you can accurately

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:02.420
predict the confidence
intervals, basically.

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:05.740
In the primaries, for example,
we would often say, well, we

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:09.156
have no idea what's going to
happen, that Rick Santorum

00:37:09.156 --> 00:37:14.050
could get anywhere from 10% of
the vote to 40% of the vote,

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:16.030
because that's what a realistic
confidence level

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:18.080
looks like, based on how
accurate the polls have been

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.710
in the past.

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:21.140
Although, I would like
to do better.

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:24.190
I think our model for working
on the primaries this year--

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:26.700
I was kind of in a
minimalist phase.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.620
So I'm like, well, I know the
polls stink, but let's just

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:31.410
take the polls and see how well
they can do and have them

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:33.530
be well-calibrated.

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:36.760
And I don't know, I think I'd
like to add a few more

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.040
elements into the primary.

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.740
So for the next cycle, we might
look at things like, for

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:42.880
example, endorsements are a
really good predictor in

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:44.040
primaries--

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.220
not because they influence
voters, but because they show

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.930
who the party supports, and the
party can tilt the playing

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:51.260
field in all sorts of ways.

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:54.860
Basically, there was a week at
which Newt Gingrich looked

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:56.420
like he was actually a threat
to win the Republican

00:37:56.420 --> 00:38:00.190
nomination, so he basically
became a pinata, where anyone

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:02.200
who had ever voted Republican
in their life and went on

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.150
television, it was their
job that week

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:05.790
to bash Newt Gingrich.

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:07.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:09.990
NATE SILVER: And so that was
how a party operates

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:11.310
strategically to make
sure it gets the

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:13.320
nominee that it wants.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.040
And believe me, Romney might
not have been the best

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:19.050
candidate, but Obama versus
Gingrich would not have been a

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:21.583
better result for Republicans,
I don't think.

00:38:21.583 --> 00:38:23.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:24.980
NATE SILVER: So looking at
those other factors in

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:27.270
primaries might be
more interesting.

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:30.930
And we'll have, I guess, two
opportunities next cycle.

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:32.570
Journalists should have been
rooting for Obama to win,

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:35.650
because that way you get two
open primaries next year,

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:36.470
instead of just one.

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:40.790
Those years are a lot more
interesting to cover.

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:42.610
HAL VARIAN: I think with the
success that we saw from

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:45.850
internet polling in the last
election, polling's going to

00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:46.960
be a lot cheaper.

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.840
England, for example, has very
high internet penetration, and

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:53.570
you could get much better
data in the future than

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:54.910
you have in the past.

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:55.525
NATE SILVER: Well, yeah.

00:38:55.525 --> 00:38:58.080
And it was good that the Google
poll, and YouGov, and a

00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.650
couple of the other internet
polls did well this year,

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:03.200
because for better or for worse,
this is going to be the

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.400
future, I think, inevitably.

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:09.530
People don't their phones,
certainly their land lines, in

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:10.730
the same way that
they used to.

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:13.460
I have a land line because it
came free with my cable

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:16.260
package, and I use it if I have
do a radio interview or

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:18.760
during hurricanes and
stuff, basically.

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.990
But you're not going to reach
me, the Quinnipiac Poll's not

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:24.410
going to reach me on my land
line, where people screen

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:24.860
their calls.

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:28.820
Even with cell phones now,
increasingly, a lot of younger

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:31.830
people are using mostly text
messages to communicate, and

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:36.740
you kind of use the phone
as a backup, almost.

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:38.840
So that's becoming a challenge,
and it's kind of

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:42.280
more natural, now, to encounter
people as they're

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.910
browsing online.

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:47.040
Now the Google Consumer
Surveys project almost

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:51.140
approaches being kind of
random internet poke.

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:52.210
That's what you do, ideally.

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:54.670
It's just someone's browsing,
and then every X number of

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:57.370
seconds, you have a random
chance of a pop-up window

00:39:57.370 --> 00:39:59.340
saying, well, who are you
going to vote for?

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:01.070
Then it'll let you
keep searching.

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:02.470
That's the equivalent
of the random-digit

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:04.410
dial method, in essence.

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:07.000
And Google is not doing
that exactly.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.430
But the fact that internet
polling did well is

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:11.100
encouraging.

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:14.460
And in fact that you have
companies that know how to use

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:15.800
data doing this--

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:19.150
I mean, a lot of pollsters
are fairly primitive.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.680
They're using, likely, voter
models that were designed 50

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:25.390
years ago, and they're very
defensive and stubborn when

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:26.680
something goes wrong.

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:30.340
I mean, for example, the Gallup
organization, their

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:33.080
polls have been screwy
for years.

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.260
People focus on the
end result--

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:37.210
which also haven't been that
good for Gallup-- but the fact

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:41.700
that they'll have these wild
gyrations from day to day, I

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.900
mean, that's usually a sign
of a badly designed model.

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:46.750
When you have wild fluctuations
that aren't

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:49.260
dictated by the fundamentals,
you're probably doing

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.070
something wrong with the way
they're taking their

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:51.690
information.

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:55.060
And by the way, because you are
only reaching a fraction

00:40:55.060 --> 00:41:00.510
of voters now, all this really
is is a modeling question.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:03.910
It's not a pure polling
question anymore.

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:06.175
Even Pugh and the best pollsters
only get about 10%

00:41:06.175 --> 00:41:07.240
of people on the phone.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:11.930
The data has to be massaged, and
that means that you need

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:17.090
statisticians to do it in ways
that are smart and accurate.

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:19.980
And if you're doing the same
things you were 50 years ago,

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:23.590
then you probably won't
be doing very well.

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:24.230
HAL VARIAN: OK.

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:26.670
I'm going to ask the last
question on my list here, and

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:28.590
then we'll open up
to the floor.

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:31.170
Both campaigns used tech for
their "get out the vote"

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:33.170
efforts, but the Democrats
seemed to have been

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:34.940
substantially more effective
than the

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.040
Republicans in this dimension.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.080
So that wouldn't show
up in the polls.

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.350
What would be a good
way to measure the

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:43.580
effect of those efforts?

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:46.320
NATE SILVER: Well, I mean,
overperforming the polls could

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:49.500
be one potential indication
of that.

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:54.520
But I think if you looked at
local voting patterns--

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:59.010
did cities, for example, in Ohio
where Obama had a field

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:02.020
office, did he get more of the
vote there than in comparable

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.420
cities where he didn't?

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:06.220
And those could be hard to
design, because maybe there

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:09.130
are reasons why Obama picks
certain cities, and so you

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:11.540
have selection bias problems.

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:14.990
But I think you'd want to look
at more macro-level data.

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:16.910
Wen campaigns are testing the
effectiveness of advertising,

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:17.970
that's what they do.

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:22.610
You run markets in Raleigh
but not Durham, or

00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:24.465
whatever, North Carolina.

00:42:24.465 --> 00:42:26.640
Although you probably
do that in practice.

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:29.570
You can set up natural
experiments and see

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:32.030
how well ads work.

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.750
But it's hard to say.

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:35.310
I mean, people assume this Obama
ground game made a lot

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:36.530
of difference.

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:38.220
And I'm sure it made
some difference.

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:40.600
But also, if you go back now
and look at states like

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:44.690
California, well, Obama beat
his polls in California by

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:48.980
several points on
Election Day.

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:50.940
And he beat his polls in
Connecticut, states like that.

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:54.195
So it wasn't purely just in the
swing states where you he

00:42:54.195 --> 00:42:55.680
overperformed his polls.

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:57.010
It was kind of everywhere.

00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:59.910
So the question is, to what
extent is the ground game edge

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:01.910
priced into the polling
already?

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:04.580
In theory, if you have voters
who are more enthusiastic or

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:06.640
more engaged by the campaigns,
then they're going to meet a

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.470
likely voters screen to begin
with, and so they'll actually

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:10.090
be in the poll already.

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:10.950
So I don't know.

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:12.640
They're difficult problems
to figure out.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:18.250
I do think that, look, Bush
and Rove were very

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:22.920
data-literate in 2000, way ahead
of Gore that year, and

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.680
they had a swing state advantage
then, where they

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:28.640
lost popular vote, won the
electoral college.

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.700
Why Republicans didn't
keep that up--

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:34.160
McCain really abandoned the
ground game in 2008, in part

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.730
because of lack of funding.

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:38.830
Romney had plenty of money, but
I think he was just maybe

00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:40.980
a little bit stubborn.

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.590
I think maybe there's a
belief that well, our

00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:44.570
message is so powerful.

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:46.430
Probably there's some start-up
companies that think, like,

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:48.340
our product is so good that
we don't have to market

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:50.300
ourselves, kind of thing.

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:53.390
That's usually a sign
of trouble.

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:55.120
And maybe the Romney campaign
thought, you know, once people

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:57.750
see how terrible the economy
is, well, then they'll vote

00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:59.820
for us no matter what.

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:03.390
When you really have to work on
the marginal voter pretty

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:06.430
hard to get them to turn out
or to change their vote.

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:08.040
HAL VARIAN: Sounds like you're
saying that Romney should have

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.146
hired a consultant.

00:44:09.146 --> 00:44:10.245
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:10.245 --> 00:44:12.620
NATE SILVER: So the other
question is--

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:13.300
HAL VARIAN: Or two.

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:16.060
NATE SILVER: Does the Obama
campaign have a systematic

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:20.140
advantage because people who are
data-literate tend to be

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:22.650
liberal or Democratic-leaning,
right?

00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:24.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:25.610
NATE SILVER: And you know, I
mean, how many people voted

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:26.910
for Romney in the Bay Area?

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:29.160
Like maybe 20% or something?

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:32.740
So you potentially have some of
these issues as well, where

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:35.370
if you have a party that has
a reputation for being

00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:39.240
anti-science or anti-empiricism,
then it's

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:41.900
maybe not going to necessarily
get the best and brightest.

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:43.500
And look, there are some bright
people working for--

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:47.290
NATE SILVER: For Romney, but I
think it actually is like a

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:50.350
little bit of a challenge,
potentially.

00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:52.370
HAL VARIAN: One of my colleagues
at Berkeley once

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:54.740
said, I've heard there's such
a thing as a Republican, but

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:55.740
I've never actually met one.

00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:58.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:00.710
HAL VARIAN: So let's
open it up.

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:02.490
Now, the acoustics are
bad, and we have

00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:04.190
to repeat your question.

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:06.270
So the floor.

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:07.240
Back there.

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:08.950
Loudly, please.

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:11.330
So the question was,
what's wrong

00:45:11.330 --> 00:45:12.560
with the polling companies?

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:15.990
Are they not effective?

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:17.700
Are they politically biased?

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:20.920
What do you see the
problems there?

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:24.450
NATE SILVER: I mean, I tend to
think for the most part,

00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:29.000
polling firms aren't
deliberately weighing the data

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.110
to match their political bias.

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:31.210
There are incentives
to be accurate.

00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:34.740
I think you might have some
exceptions where, for

00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:35.900
example-- or not for example.

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:40.880
So Rasmussen Reports, for
instance, their business model

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:44.430
seems to be to provide good
news for Republicans,

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:49.670
basically, within a certain
distance of being realistic.

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:52.260
Well, I'm just saying, that
seems to be almost a conscious

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:54.750
decision on their behalf.

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:59.570
Because they have polls, and
every year their polls have

00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:02.410
had a Republican lean, relative
to the consensus, so

00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:04.850
when Republicans do well, then
they're polls are fine, but

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:08.060
when they have a bad year,
they're really far off.

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:11.400
But that'd be something that
I think a company who was

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.330
prizing accuracy would go in and
look at, and say, why are

00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:17.970
we always Republican-leaning and
often wrong, relative to

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:18.570
everyone else?

00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:21.110
And you would fix it.

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:23.040
But they seem to have a
different idea about the way

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:25.870
that they can make the most
income and get their name in

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:26.770
the news the most.

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:29.920
But I don't think Gallup
has a Republican

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.070
partisan bias or anything.

00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:37.000
I think they're just a stubborn
old company that

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.590
wasn't willing to open up the
hood enough, and wasn't

00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:42.190
willing to admit that
they had a problem.

00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:44.420
And so we kind of get back to
this whole question of honest

00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:45.200
self-assessment.

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.150
But people assume--

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:49.130
when you had the Unskewed Polls
guy, he was convinced

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:52.290
that the Fox News poll was part
of the conspiracy to rig

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:55.200
the election for Obama.

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:58.670
And believe me, when the "New
York Times," I think, had some

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:01.770
poll, where last year, Obama
had like a 39% approval

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:04.630
rating, just an outlier that
kind of happens sometimes,

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:06.720
people were like, well, you
know, the "New York Times,"

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:09.390
they've become a conservative
paper now.

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:10.030
This proves it.

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:12.910
I mean, the polling wing of
a newspaper is usually the

00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:18.100
least-biased part of a news
organization, including,

00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:21.390
often, the reporters
themselves.

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:24.820
There's some great reporters,
but there's a lot of

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:28.890
subjectivity in how the
news is reported, even

00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:30.930
on the front page.

00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:34.200
And polling, at least if you
do the right things, if you

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:38.090
kind of follow the recommended
practices, then you come

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:41.110
closer to objectivity,
at least potentially.

00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:41.400
HAL VARIAN: OK.

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:44.770
So the question was, you've
shown how statistics can help

00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:47.500
dramatically in sports
and in politics, so

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:50.600
what's the next area?

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:51.970
NATE SILVER: If I knew,
I'd be taking meetings

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:53.213
with VCs right now.

00:47:53.213 --> 00:47:55.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:56.200
NATE SILVER: I don't know.

00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:58.000
I think there are
a lot of areas--

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.160
education is an area that
fascinates me, because you're

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.570
seeing more data used.

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:05.116
And I don't know a lot about how
it's being used, but I bet

00:48:05.116 --> 00:48:08.830
it's not being used all that
well, necessarily.

00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:10.080
There are a lot of things.

00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:16.040
I did a project for "New York
Magazine" where we looked at

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:19.830
different neighborhoods in New
York and tried to rate them.

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:21.900
We found, by the way, actually
that New York rental apartment

00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:24.840
prices were very efficiently
calibrated on a

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:26.960
neighborhood-to-neighborhood
basis, where basically if you

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:32.130
look at distance to Midtown
Manhattan plus parkland plus

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:34.610
schools, then you could explain,
you get an r-squared

00:48:34.610 --> 00:48:40.110
of like 93% in explaining
prices per square foot.

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:42.600
But things like that
might be fun.

00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:45.740
But look, I mean, for every
problem where statistics have

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:47.300
made a lot of progress possible,
you also have areas

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:50.850
where they've been probably
misapplied in different ways.

00:48:50.850 --> 00:48:53.090
In the book, you talk about
how earthquake predictions

00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:55.370
have not gotten a lot
better, for example.

00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:57.880
I think in economics--

00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:00.790
although some of stuff
that Howell is doing.

00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:04.550
I mean, how often do you,
do you talk with the

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:05.550
White House and stuff?

00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:06.760
Or do you talk with--

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:07.240
well, I can't--

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:09.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:10.886
NATE SILVER: I don't mean the
White House in particular, but

00:49:10.886 --> 00:49:12.290
I mean, do you talk with the
Bureau of Labor Statistics?

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:12.640
HAL VARIAN: Oh, yeah.

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:13.130
NATE SILVER: Yeah.

00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:14.950
Yeah.

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:17.830
I mean, this is a rare space
where you actually have new

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:22.070
economic data being produced
that might be underutilized.

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:27.260
But in general, most economic
people have been trying to do

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:29.610
economic forecasts for a very
long time, and not really

00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:30.310
gotten anywhere.

00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:32.590
So it might be a question
of saying, OK, well,

00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:34.200
we're crying uncle.

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:35.760
We're giving up, but we're
going to specify more

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:38.710
accurately how much uncertainty
there really is in

00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:40.450
the forecast.

00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:43.280
So there are kind of two
ends that you can berm.

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.570
We can say, well, if we want to
bring our predictions more

00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:48.030
in line with reality, sometimes
it's a matter of

00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:50.290
applying better techniques, and
sometimes it's a matter of

00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:54.100
admitting what we don't know,
and problems that are

00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:56.315
intractable, at least as far
as the near-term goes.

00:49:56.315 --> 00:49:58.880
HAL VARIAN: Yeah, I think
there's a whole area

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:01.150
economists sometimes call
nowcasting, where the

00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:03.950
objective isn't so much to
forecast, but to try to get an

00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:06.860
accurate measure of what's going
on now, rather than wait

00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:09.570
for the government statistics
to come out six weeks or a

00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:10.710
quarter later.

00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:13.430
And with all the real-time data
that's available in the

00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:16.690
private sector, I think we can
do a much, much better job of

00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:19.530
nowcasting the economy, tracking
what's going on a

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:21.010
moment-by-moment basis.

00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:25.150
But the one thing I did want
to suggest as a very

00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:26.940
attractive area, at
least for us here

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:28.470
at Google, is marketing.

00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:32.620
Because market is a subject
that's full of mythology and

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:34.180
shamans and all this stuff.

00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:37.460
But if you do it right, as we
try to do here at Google, I

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:39.100
think you could really
make some progress.

00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:39.860
NATE SILVER: Yeah.

00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:46.130
And probably industries like TV
and film are cases where--

00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:47.900
the studios are very
smart and very

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:50.530
scientific about some things.

00:50:50.530 --> 00:50:54.440
But in terms of, what's the
right portfolio of different

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:59.030
film genres to build, or
questions like that.

00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:02.990
Or if you have a particular
product, to whom should you

00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:04.000
show that advertisement?

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.400
That's where Google probably is
working on analogous types

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:08.670
of problems.

00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:11.470
But I think there's probably a
lot a low-hanging fruit in

00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:14.540
those sorts of areas.

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:17.290
HAL VARIAN: The question is,
when you put economic

00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:20.600
variables in your model, for
example, you just put them in

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:21.480
with equal weight.

00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:24.360
And the explanation was you
wanted to avoid overfitting.

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:26.750
But how do you know didn't
distort the model

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:29.380
in some other way?

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:34.230
Why was that an attractive
choice in that circumstance?

00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:36.940
NATE SILVER: There's some
literature, kind of in the

00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:40.060
forecasting literature, that
says that as a default, if you

00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:43.070
don't have enough empirical
data, if the data's not rich

00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:47.330
enough to develop weights from
your sample, then just tending

00:51:47.330 --> 00:51:50.230
to weight factors equally
is not a bad habit.

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:53.880
And at least that way, you avoid
convoluted schemes where

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:58.920
you're weighting something at
80%, something else at 0.02%.

00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:02.200
Look, we use seven economic
variables and we're trying to

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:05.320
fit them based on 10
past elections.

00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:09.990
And they're highly correlated
with one another.

00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:13.040
So we're nowhere in the ballpark
of having enough data

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:16.625
to develop reliable weights
based on the in-sample result.

00:52:16.625 --> 00:52:21.040
The [INAUDIBLE] philosophy too
is just that we didn't want to

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:24.720
develop an election-specific
measure of the economy.

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:27.490
We just wanted an overall
economic index.

00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:29.430
Ideally, you would have some
economic index that someone

00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:30.680
else developed.

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:32.650
Some banks will have
these, for example.

00:52:32.650 --> 00:52:36.160
Like Goldman Sachs, their
forecasting team has a version

00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:41.020
of GDP that's like better than
GDP, because it includes more

00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:43.580
data series and reduces some
of the noise you get in the

00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:44.590
GDP estimate.

00:52:44.590 --> 00:52:46.580
So if we had something
like that, then

00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:47.560
that would be ideal.

00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:49.990
But there's not a public
product that

00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:50.960
quite fit the bill.

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:54.090
So we just wanted an index that
basically captured kind

00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:58.590
of what's going on in the
economy in one number, to the

00:52:58.590 --> 00:52:59.220
extent you can.

00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:01.160
Which of course, is inherently a
little bit foolish, but it's

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.210
probably better to have
something that accounts for

00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:05.120
different major aspects--

00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:08.960
so jobs, income, industrial
production, inflation,

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.300
different major categories.

00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:13.970
And we didn't think you had to
get a lot fancier than that in

00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:15.980
terms of weighting them, because
it's not clear what

00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:16.860
you're weighting to.

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:19.840
We wanted to weight to
correspond to how important is

00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:22.660
something to the economy,
basically.

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:25.400
And then you've got to answer
the question of, well, how

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.050
does the economy predict
elections?

00:53:27.050 --> 00:53:29.710
Instead of kind of saying,
well, this one obscure

00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:32.300
variable that we found
on Fred perfectly

00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:33.550
correlates with elections.

00:53:33.550 --> 00:53:35.830
I mean, those models have
not done all that well.

00:53:35.830 --> 00:53:37.730
People get too cutesy.

00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:40.360
But the principle that you want
to aggregate information,

00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:43.010
have more than one indicator,
is pretty helpful.

00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:47.590
And our model, just the economic
component, actually

00:53:47.590 --> 00:53:50.610
would have had Obama winning by
2 and 1/2 points, which is

00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:52.460
pretty close to the
actual outcome.

00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:55.120
And other models that people
used that took indices or that

00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:58.170
aggregated different economic
data points together also did

00:53:58.170 --> 00:53:58.800
pretty well.

00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.880
Whereas some of the ones that
just fixated on one data

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:04.020
series were pretty
far off the mark.

00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:06.860
One had Romney winning by six
points or something, which was

00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:09.220
not a very good forecast
this year.

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:11.440
HAL VARIAN: So again, I want to
repeat, the question was,

00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:13.390
what's the craziest thing
or funniest thing a

00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:15.472
fan as said to you?

00:54:15.472 --> 00:54:17.000
Pretty tough question here.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:17.660
NATE SILVER: I'm not sure.

00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:18.720
I was on the plane
the other day.

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:24.750
I was coach in a middle seat
out to San Francisco.

00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:26.650
And some woman in first class
said, I guess they don't have

00:54:26.650 --> 00:54:31.100
any polls in coach, or something
weird like that.

00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:32.300
But there are these weird--

00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:34.480
so I found out that--

00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:36.000
this'll wear off, I'm sure.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.980
But if I'm going out to dinner
with my friends, I'm booking a

00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:40.150
reservation in my name.

00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:42.720
So there's like a 30% chance
that you get like a free round

00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:45.370
of champagne or something,
at some point.

00:54:45.370 --> 00:54:46.805
I shouldn't reveal that
secret, right?

00:54:46.805 --> 00:54:48.390
HAL VARIAN: Yeah, I think
there's going to be a lot of

00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:49.150
people trying that--

00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:51.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:54.280
HAL VARIAN: Trying that
plan in San Francisco.

00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:56.890
NATE SILVER: So I went out to
some restaurant, it was called

00:54:56.890 --> 00:54:59.170
Local's Corner-- which was
really good, by the way, in

00:54:59.170 --> 00:54:59.600
the Mission District.

00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:00.840
Very good.

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:04.580
But they said they had Googled
me to make sure, or

00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:06.080
Twitter-followed me,
to show that I was

00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:08.210
actually in the Bay Area.

00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:10.840
Because they've had this scam
before, where someone's like,

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:13.020
I'm Peter Fonda.

00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:15.660
And maybe they weren't quite
sure what Peter Fonda looked

00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:17.490
like, and so they try and
play that game to

00:55:17.490 --> 00:55:18.280
get a better seat.

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:20.990
So they actually followed
the paper trail

00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:23.180
and did their research.

00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:24.490
HAL VARIAN: What kind of seat
do you suppose Mitt

00:55:24.490 --> 00:55:26.150
Romney would get?

00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:26.920
NATE SILVER: In San Francisco?

00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:28.290
Well, I was thinking
what would happen--

00:55:28.290 --> 00:55:31.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:31.730
NATE SILVER: Sorry,
we're full.

00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:33.180
HAL VARIAN: Exactly.

00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:37.610
NATE SILVER: Because look, in
2016, if the Republican's

00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:40.160
likely to win, then hopefully,
we'll have the Republican

00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:41.940
winning in our forecasting
model.

00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:44.190
So I'd have to go to,
I don't know,

00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:46.640
like Dallas, or something.

00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:48.665
We'll give you a free plate of
barbecue ribs for correctly--

00:55:48.665 --> 00:55:49.955
[INAUDIBLE].

00:55:49.955 --> 00:55:50.940
I like ribs.

00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:53.726
I like Texas food.

00:55:53.726 --> 00:55:56.020
But yeah.

00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:56.470
HAL VARIAN: All right.

00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:57.580
Last question.

00:55:57.580 --> 00:56:00.170
How can we improve the teaching
of statistics?

00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:01.280
NATE SILVER: That's
a big question,

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:02.250
an important question.

00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:03.800
HAL VARIAN: Important.

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:07.430
NATE SILVER: And I'm not sure
why statistics education or

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:12.660
math eduction in general is so
abstract in this country.

00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:16.830
I think you should just kind of
give kids data and let them

00:56:16.830 --> 00:56:18.780
play around with it,
at a certain level.

00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:20.590
And I don't know exactly what
type of data you'd give to a

00:56:20.590 --> 00:56:24.990
high-school class exactly, but
to have kids conduct a survey

00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:28.040
or to have kids just start
counting things to come to

00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:28.820
some conclusions about them.

00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:33.160
I mean, the fact that people
are phobic of math is odd.

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:35.180
I get the comment sometimes from
readers on my blog, like,

00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:39.330
oh, I thought I hated math, or
I'm terrible at math, but I

00:56:39.330 --> 00:56:40.080
like your blog.

00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:40.950
You'll hear that.

00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:43.970
And probably, that person
is not terrible at math.

00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:47.860
Probably they had some teacher
who made them dislike math for

00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:51.000
some reason along the way,
because it wasn't taught in a

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.810
way that it had practical,
real-world applications.

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:56.620
And I hope that will change.

00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:58.810
I don't know enough about what
different curriculum

00:56:58.810 --> 00:56:59.500
teachers are using.

00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:01.920
I think probably the fact that
you have more teaching to the

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:05.330
tests now is harmful, of
course, to any type of

00:57:05.330 --> 00:57:07.870
innovation in math and
science education.

00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:11.090
But I mean, that could be a
subject that I want to write a

00:57:11.090 --> 00:57:14.000
book on or something, down the
line, is how math is taught,

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.420
and how that could
be improved.
