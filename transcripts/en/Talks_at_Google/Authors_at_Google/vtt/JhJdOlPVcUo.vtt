&gt;&gt;commentator: Thanks everyone for coming
today and for dialing in. Today we have the

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.620
next installment in the Authors@Google series
and I'm very pleased to present Angela Saini.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.590
Angela is an award winning science journalist
who writes for the New Scientist, Wide, and

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.770
GQ. She's also a regular reporter for the
BBC including the Digital Planet program.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.490
"Geek Nation" is her first book. It's just
been released to great reviews in Europe.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.190
It is coming out in Asia next week, and we
just found out that it's gone to number four

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.769
in the India bestsellers list today even pre-release
so. It's coming out in the U.S. shortly but

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:43.999
if you didn't pick up the book on the way
in, you can pick one up Amazon or on the Kindle.

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:48.460
Angela's based in London but she's flown in
from New York to be with us today. So thank

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.229
you very much for coming. Without further
ado, Angela Saini.

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:54.229
[applause]

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:58.769
&gt;&gt;Angela Siani: This is a really small audience
but I'm cheered by the fact that millions

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.670
of YouTube listeners will be watching it.
Yes.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.690
My book launched a month ago and I have done
quite a few talks since then but never to

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:15.120
a very techy audience. So if this way below
your I.Q. level, please tell me and I'll speed

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.990
it up and I'll find something more interesting
to talk about.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.540
I didn't really know what to talk about. "Geek
Nation covers" so many themes. Each chapter

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.890
is a self contained story in its own right
and there's an overarching narrative that

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.580
goes on top of it. So it's very difficult
to pick out stories and have them make sense

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.070
or pick out things and have them make sense.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.360
But one of the things that people always say
to me especially if they've visited India

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.520
or they've lived in India, is, "India is such
a poor country. How is it possible that this

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.220
could be a nation of geeks? How can it be
possible that you are calling it an aspiring

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.750
scientific superpower? There's a huge paradox
there." So that's what I want to talk about

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.080
today and I want to try and communicate to
you this idea that even though India is poor

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.899
and has high rates of illiteracy and poor
education, it can still have the potential

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.379
of entering the ranks of a scientific giant.

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.389
And, also at the same time, my book doesn't
have any pictures in it and people have said

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:22.300
they would love to be able to see pictures
of the places I'm describing so that's -- I'm

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.120
gonna give you a chance to have a look at
some of the places that I talk about.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:34.939
So there is this weird thing that India is
this eleventh largest economy and yet it is

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:40.299
still, it still has very high rates of illiteracy.
So it actually has more illiterate adults

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.609
than there are people in the U.S. which kind
of puts that in perspective, while at the

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.989
same time having this huge population of scientists
and engineers.

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:59.290
So I wanted to start by putting some kind
of perspective for you on the culture, the

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.359
culture of geekiness that I believe exists
in India. So the picture on the slide right

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:12.189
now is of Viswanathan Anand who is an Indian
chess champion, actually world chess champion.

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:18.159
And India loves chess. It has this huge passion
for chess and so I want to start just by reading

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:24.090
an extract from the beginning of the book
in Chapter 1 where I go to this chess tournament

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.299
in Delhi and I try to figure out why it is
that Indian's love chess so much.

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:35.419
"So the country is ranked fourth globally
in the sport and chess players insist it is

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:40.779
a sport above the United States which is ninth."
Which gives you some perspective on how brilliant

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:42.489
India really is at chess.

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.870
"But there's something more unusual about
this scene in the chess tournament. Generally

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.999
India is not a sporting nation. In fact apart
from cricket and a handful of other games,

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:58.349
chess is a rare exception in a land that has
one of the worst sporting records of anywhere

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:59.819
in the world.

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.109
Take the Olympics, for example. In the history
of the modern games the United States has

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:16.060
won 2,549 medals. Great Britain has won 737,
and China 429. Even the small Eastern European

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.380
nation of Belarus has taken home 73. But you
have to scroll almost to the bottom of the

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.850
league tables to find India. It sits just
above the desolate central Asian republic

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:34.400
of Mongolia and just below Slovakia. In the
whole of the Olympics history, India has won

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:41.840
only 20 medals. Given the country's vast population,
it's a mystery that's confused sports writers

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.250
for decades.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.990
So a few years ago, two U.S. researchers,
Anirudh Krishna from the Stanford Institute

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.760
of Public Policy at Duke University and Eric
Haglund from the Congressional Hunger Center

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.970
decided to investigate. A country of more
than a billion people like India they calculated

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:05.510
should have won 157 medals at the 2004 Olympic
games. But, of course, this fails to take

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:11.190
into account that elite sports are expensive,
ruling out millions of Indians who would never

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.900
have a hope of becoming professional athletes.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.730
Wealth and size aren't the only things that
determine Olympic success either. There's

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.870
also the general level of education, people's
health, and how close they live to sporting

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.060
facilities. So the researchers crunched the
numbers again. Taking into account the myriad

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.250
factors that determine sporting success, they
came up with a formal conservative estimate.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:41.120
India should have won around 14 medals at
the 2004 Olympic games they said."

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.840
Does anyone know how many they actually won?

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.840
[pause]

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.840
It was one.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.120
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [unintelligible]

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.220
"And in fact no other nation in their study
had such a huge gap between its predicted

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:59.300
medal count and the actual total. 'India did
not and does not have a sporting culture,'

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.730
the veteran Indian sports columnist Rohit
Brijnath explains to me frankly. Today he

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.880
works with The Straits Times newspaper in
Singapore after the Indian sports magazine

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:15.100
he was writing for closed down. 'Personally
one of the things I always felt as a sports

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:21.570
writer was a lack of drive among many athletes.
I can't understand it. It is much better now

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:26.510
but earlier you only found that drive here
and there in exceptions like the great 400

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:32.460
meter runner of the 1960's Milkha Singh who
used to boast that he trained so hard that

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:38.160
he used to pee blood. My theory and it's just
mine' he adds 'is that we're better suited

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:44.830
to hand eye sports like shooting or billiards
or archery or thinking sports like chess.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:51.390
I turned to Radisham Tuari, a 64 year old
international arbiter for the World Chess

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:57.430
Association, for his opinion. He's been playing
this game for 40 years. Watching the players

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:02.890
on the table next to us, he ponders the question
for awhile. 'Indians well basically they have

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:09.890
a good liking for brainy games,' he announces
at last rolling each R with his tongue. 'Yes,

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:15.950
and we are good at brainy things,' he continues.
'Brain makes us supreme.'"

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.900
That kind of sums up the attitude that Indians
have to science and technology and academic

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:28.940
pursuits. This idea that sport, physical sport,
isn't really necessary in order to move the

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:34.230
nation forward even though it might be a nice
indicator of a kind of show of how much of

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:38.740
a superpower a country is, but what really
will take them forward is academic games:

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:45.500
chess and if you look at the Olympiads which
unlike the Olympics are a kind of a academic

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.800
contest that happen around the world among
students, India actually does really well.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.430
It's one of the champions in that.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:58.190
And so one of the things I wanted to figure
out when I wrote "Geek Nation" was where does

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:05.460
this apparent love of brainy games comes from?
Why India? And why Asia as well?

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.620
India actually has a very long scientific
history. I'm just gonna give you a quick,

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:16.000
really quick overview now. India has a very
long scientific history as well as having

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.860
some of the world's leading philosophers two
thousand, one thousand years ago. It was the

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:29.860
place where the zero was invented which you
guys will probably know is a linchpin of modern

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:35.800
mathematics, it's very important to modern
maths. It was also a big center of philosophy.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:41.120
The picture on the screen right now is of
the Bakhshali manuscript which is the oldest

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:47.670
scientific text ever found in Asia and it
was found in a farm in what is now Pakistan

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:55.940
but obviously used to be India once. And I
spent a really long time when I was there

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.090
trying to dig behind the history. There's
not that much of it in the book, but just

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:03.430
out of personal interest, I really wanted
to figure out where are these texts and where

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:07.610
do they lie. A lot of them have been destroyed
over the years. And the Bakhshali manuscript

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:13.910
oddly turned out not to be in India anymore
at all. One hundred years ago it was moved

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:19.940
to Oxford which is where I studied so I had
to go back to the UK in order to see it. And

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:26.890
very kindly the library at my old college
let me in and let me see the manuscript. It's

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:32.300
beautiful. What you can see here is exactly
what it looks like, this kind of faded palm

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:38.450
leaf manuscript, a little shred. But you can
see, not so much on this one but on the shred

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:43.640
that I saw you can see numbers in columns
and little groupings everywhere and different

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:50.680
signs, which just goes to show that before
the West had even encountered these quite

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:55.960
sophisticated mathematical ideas and scientific
ideas, countries like India and China already

00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:02.040
had them. The problem was, just like the Bakhshali
manuscript, they all moved West and they didn't

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.089
stay in the East and the East didn't really
take advantage of them like they could have,

00:10:06.089 --> 00:10:10.460
and science and technology instead rose in
the West which is why we have the situation

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.210
that we have now.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:17.690
India never went through an enlightenment
like Europe did. It never went through a Renaissance

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:24.250
like Europe did. And it wasn't India that
took advantage of advances, those early advances

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:28.720
in science and tech. It was a royal society
in London that was one of the places that

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:35.360
became the arena for the development of modern
science as we understand it today. So this

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:41.260
idea that you can make a hypothesis, test
it empirically, and then subject it to peer

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.870
review, which is what we think of science
now, that was not what science looked like

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.170
a thousand, two thousand years ago.

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:54.950
So India kind of exists in this strange scientific
limbo because it hasn't completely separated

00:10:54.950 --> 00:11:04.670
these ideas of the past with modern science.
It is re [bad audio] pseudoscience and astrology

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:11.770
and homeopathy and ideas that in the West
where we've ditched to some extent or at least

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:16.110
we don't treat them like we treat modern science.
In India, they sit almost side by side.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:20.740
So, for example, I sent to the Indian Science
Congress last year in January which is the

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:26.020
biggest scientific meeting in India and the
Prime Minister comes, lots of ministers. And

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:34.390
in the exhibition hall, there were pamphlets
on Vedic Science and Vedic Science is a type

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:41.630
of religious, Hindu religious science and
astrology and there were panels on homeopathy.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:49.400
So there is this, it does exist in this strange
limbo and it's been difficult to get out of

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.620
it because that Renaissance period never happened,
but they have tried.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:59.700
And so now I want to go much forward in time
and back about 60 years when India became

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.260
independent from the British.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:06.940
So India's first Prime Minister, after the
country became independent from the British

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:16.440
in 1947, was Jawaharlal Nehru. And these days,
we always think of Nehru as this kind of charismatic,

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:25.480
cool leader who was a bit of a ladies' man
and built this entire nation from scratch

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:31.140
after the British left India. But he was also
a geek in his own right. He studied natural

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:37.610
sciences at Cambridge and when he became Prime
Minister of India, he had seen what had happened

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:42.800
in the U.S. and he'd seen what happened in
the Soviet Union and said to himself, "I want

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.301
a part of that for India. Science and technology
is the way we are going to grow this country.

00:12:47.301 --> 00:12:53.260
And we have to do it not just by investing
in science and tech but also by making the

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:59.500
population more rational." So it was almost
a call to enlightenment -- not quite because

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:06.540
it was many hundreds of years later. But his
legacy was so huge that if you look at the

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:11.610
Indian Constitution now, it says on the slide,
"One of the fundamental duties of an Indian

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:18.960
citizen is to develop the scientific temper,
humanism, and the spirit of inquiry and reform,"

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:24.730
which is unique in constitutions around the
world. We can't even imagine that now, that

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:29.740
all those decades ago, Indian leaders would
have looked at the country and said, "This

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:35.890
is a birthplace of four major world religions,
a very spiritual nation, yet we have to make

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:40.690
the country more rational and logical in the
way it thinks. Even if you're not a scientist

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:47.339
in your everyday life, we want you to be more
logical."

00:13:47.339 --> 00:13:52.000
So Nehru carried this kind of legacy forward
and it was a button that was picked up by

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.779
subsequent leaders, every single one. So he
founded these huge Indian institutes of technology

00:13:58.779 --> 00:14:06.310
which today many of the people who graduated
from there in 1970s and 1980s have come to

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:11.930
Silicon Valley and San Francisco, have set
up huge firms. So Sun Microsystems, for example,

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:20.810
was founded by Vinod Khosla who's an IIT graduate.
And many of India's IT leaders and politicians,

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:28.029
technocrats, are IIT graduates. He also founded
nuclear power stations, hydroelectric dams;

00:14:28.029 --> 00:14:34.520
he invested in labs and research facilities.
So he really laid or helped to lay the foundation

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:40.350
for what we now think of as more of a nation
of geeks.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:45.370
But then the question is, given this kind
of geeky culture that exists and given this

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:51.350
investment on the government's side into science
and technology, what exactly today are we

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:58.399
seeing in terms of results? So how far is
India really at becoming a scientific superpower?

00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:03.540
That was a big question for me. I'm a, I mean
I'm a science journalist, I work mainly in

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:07.899
the UK, and I was skeptical when I went to
India because a lot of people have said to

00:15:07.899 --> 00:15:13.339
me, "You won't even find enough examples of
original Indian science to fill your book.

00:15:13.339 --> 00:15:16.720
There's not much going on there."

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:22.430
So one of the first things I did when I landed
in New Delhi, that was in the winter of 2009,

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:28.920
was I knew the first thing had to be that
I had to visit one of these Indian institutes

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:33.480
of technology to see what they're like on
the inside. Are they really these hotbeds

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:40.800
of exciting innovation or are they just perpetuating
the stereotype that Indian engineers are kind

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.770
of geeky, drone-like, and a bit boring and
dull?

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:51.580
So the picture on the slide here is inside
the geek factory, the Indian Institute of

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:56.600
Technology in Delhi. The photographs that
you're going to see now, the next three slides

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:04.050
were taken by Tom Parker who is a Conde Nast
photographer. I did a piece for GQ at the

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:09.950
same time as visiting the IIT and these are
pictures that he took. And they're a perfect

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:12.690
glimpse into how these places look.

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:20.230
This especially: it's a dusty window or a
board where a guy is writing on and you can

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:24.730
see a kind of shabby lecture theater in the
background, and that's exactly what this place

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:29.640
is like. They're really shabby. I was kind
of disappointed at turning up to this, what

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:34.650
is meant to be the most elite engineering
college in the whole of India, and it didn't

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:38.560
have air conditioning in most of the lecture
theaters which meant that in the summer, these

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.839
kids boil to death and yet they still have
to turn up to lectures.

00:16:42.839 --> 00:16:49.320
And worse than that, worse than the shabbiness
and the old fashioned lecture theaters and

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:55.390
the lack of air conditioning, there really
didn't seem to be, on the surface at least,

00:16:55.390 --> 00:17:04.209
any kind of spirits of creativity. I mean
I studied engineering and when I was there,

00:17:04.209 --> 00:17:08.579
one of my classmates built a computer in his
spare time. When I was a kid, I used to build

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:15.750
model rockets and engineers are natural tinkerers
and there didn't seem to be this quality among

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:20.799
the Indian, young Indian engineers that I
was meeting at the Indian Institute of Technology.

00:17:20.799 --> 00:17:25.741
And that kind of disappointed me, although
it did reinforce the stereotype and it did

00:17:25.741 --> 00:17:26.741
confirm it.

00:17:26.741 --> 00:17:31.630
So I tried to figure out, why is it? Why is
it that these kids choose to do engineering

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:38.501
and yet they don't seem to have a passion
for it? And part of the reason is that the

00:17:38.501 --> 00:17:41.630
education system is so competitive.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:49.720
So in 2009, almost half a million Indian students
sat the engineering college entrance exams

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:54.820
and only 10,000 of them got a place, which
just goes to show -- that's harder to get

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:59.179
into than Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge, any
of the big universities in the West -- which

00:17:59.179 --> 00:18:04.110
just goes to show how difficult and competitive
these places are. And so in order to win a

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:10.970
place like that, in order to pass the exams,
these kids spend every evening and every weekend

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:16.320
in coaching classes. So almost all the students
at this Indian Institute of Technology will

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.570
have been coached almost entirely through
their teenage years and by the time they get

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:26.230
to college, they're burnt out, understandably.
That passion has been sucked out of them,

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:31.320
if you like. They're literally spending their
childhoods cramming for these exams.

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:37.890
And this, the picture on the slide right now
is of a kid called Nishant Ranka. He's 22

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:43.679
years old, an engineering student, and he
said to me, "When I went to the UK and saw

00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:48.740
people shut their shops at five o'clock, I
couldn't understand it. Here they're open

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:56.100
late into the night. Indians work a lot, lot
harder than Europeans and Americans." And

00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:01.340
he told me that he was coached before he came
to college for three hours a day as well as

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:05.720
the nine hours he would study anyway at school
to make sure he passed the exams.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:11.890
And the pressure is so immense that the National
Crime Records Bureau which keeps a check of

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:18.010
suicides, the suicide rate across India, in
2008, which is their most recent figure, more

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:22.951
than 2,000 students across India committed
suicide because of the pressure of exams and

00:19:22.951 --> 00:19:24.940
the fear that they would fail.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:32.460
So this, the growth in IT has lead to the
demand for engineers, has led to thousands

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:38.020
more kids wanting to go to college to study
engineering, but has also lead in turn to

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:45.240
this kind of [BAD AUDIO] is stifled because
of the competition and because it's so difficult

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:51.900
to get into these places. But that is changing,
and it was only after spending many weeks

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:58.400
there that I noticed how these tiny little
shoots of innovation are coming up now.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:06.780
So the next slide is of, is still inside the
Indian Institute of Technology. In 1991, so

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:12.240
when Nehru became Prime Minister of India
he was very much a socialist. He believed

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:16.429
that India had to be self sufficient, had
to do everything itself. He didn't believe

00:20:16.429 --> 00:20:23.059
in foreign imports, not only of objects but
also ideas. In 1991, that began to change;

00:20:23.059 --> 00:20:28.260
India liberalized its economy. I'm sorry this
is a really potted history, it's really quick

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.890
[laughs] and I hope you're keeping up with
it.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:37.679
So in 1991, the economy liberalized. MTV came
in, Coca-Cola came in, but also with that

00:20:37.679 --> 00:20:43.650
was this kind of influx of new ideas, foreign
ideas. It was easier to travel. Everybody

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:50.320
saw more of the world, and this new generation
came up. A guy at Tata Consultancy Services

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:55.730
which is one of Indian's big three IT firms
called it "Generation WHY." So not Generation

00:20:55.730 --> 00:21:03.179
XY but Generation W-H-Y, the first generation
post-liberalization who are willing to question

00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:09.620
and not just do rote learning or not just
cram for exams but think outside the box a

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:10.620
bit.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:16.630
And at the IIT in Delhi, I wanted to find
evidence of that and luckily, fortunately

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:21.350
I did. It's beneath the surface and it's only
just beginning to happen now which makes sense

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:26.390
if you think about it because the 22 year
olds of now are the ones who have grown up

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:27.390
in this post-liberalization age, post-1991.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:38.210
So the student in the slide right now took
part in a contest called the Rubicon which

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:47.220
is a big Pan-Asian event where students have
to come together and build a robot that can

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:51.270
do one specific human task. So things like
this are happening. There's also this new

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:57.929
group on campus called "Technocracy" which
in their spare time they're learning things

00:21:57.929 --> 00:22:02.850
like MATLAB which is a venturing programming
language and they're learning to build microprocessors.

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:11.530
So there's tiny, creative shoots that are
coming up right now. It's very small and in

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:17.630
the six months I spent researching this book,
I did find tiny examples of this innovation

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:26.010
happening all over India, but it's very small
and it's very much at the beginning of a revolution,

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:27.010
if you like.

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:32.179
And I think the reason we still carry the
stereotype that we do about the Indian engineers

00:22:32.179 --> 00:22:38.910
reminds me a lot of how we saw Japan in the
1970s, 1960s and 70s: that here is this country

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:42.410
that is really good at copying what other
people are doing, but not so good at coming

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:47.549
up with its own ideas. And India is in that
state now, but just crossing the line in the

00:22:47.549 --> 00:22:53.260
same way that Japan did. So these kids who
are now graduating, who have only lived in

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:59.860
a liberalized India, are going to be the ones
that think outside the box and create this

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:06.510
new innovative society -- the kind of society
that you have in San Francisco and Silicon

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:11.150
Valley that is truly scientific and creative.

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:16.490
So what are they actually achieving in scientific
terms? Now given that this generation hasn't

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:22.800
completely come of age yet, it's a bit difficult,
but one example that I talk about in the book

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:32.070
is tuberculosis. So research into tuberculosis
is quite wide spread in India. It's a disease

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:40.400
that kills two Indians every three minutes.
So it's incredibly deadly, incredibly contagious.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:45.000
In the West, we haven't heard of it so much
or it's not so prevalent just because it's

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.220
almost been eradicated here. And it is a function
of poverty. It's a function of poor health

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:55.480
and poor diet and low immunity, and in India,
it's a huge problem.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:00.789
The picture on the slide right now is of a
tuberculosis clinic in Mumbai and a poor guy

00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:07.140
being, having his chest examined by a doctor.
Now I didn't go to Mumbai. I actually went

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:13.730
to Chennai to visit some TB hospitals. And
Chennai, if you don't know already, is India's

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:19.400
medical capital. It's so great at medicine.
It has some of the best hospitals in the world,

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:24.850
so good in fact that medical tourists go from
the West to have their hips replaced and kidneys

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:30.570
replaced there at rock bottom prices, and
they can stay in a fancy hotel while they're

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:34.760
doing it. But of course that's not where the
poor go. The poor end up in places like this

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.170
and they're the majority.

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:42.780
So here is a deadly disease killing millions
of Indians and millions in the developing

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:48.570
world. Western pharmaceutical companies haven't
come up with a cure for TB in 40 years, a

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:53.200
new treatment in 40 years, which means that
if you have TB, you need to take a cocktail

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:58.020
of drugs for six months in order to fix it
and even then, you're not guaranteed of not

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:03.240
being contagious. And while you are contagious,
the chances are you will infect many dozens

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.720
of people around you.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:12.179
So the reason that big pharma don't invest
in TB is like I said it's not a disease prevalent

00:25:12.179 --> 00:25:18.680
in the West, there's not that much money for
it. But in India, what they're doing is all

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:23.221
these disparate researchers with very small,
with a very small amount of resources and

00:25:23.221 --> 00:25:31.210
in very ramshackle labs, are trying to work
on it. So I visited one researcher, for example,

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:41.110
in Chennai who has a lab that's so unbiosafe,
has such poor resources, that you can't even

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:45.809
work on the TB bacterium itself because it's
too dangerous. She has to work on E. coli

00:25:45.809 --> 00:25:53.840
which is the closest to TB that she can get
and do studies on safely for her team.

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.620
So what's the solution? Given that you have
all these poor but willing researchers all

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:03.460
over India working on this drug, on this bug
and trying to come up with a solution and

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:10.230
yet they don't have the resources of big pharma.
And this is what may be the solution. It's

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:19.140
the Open Source Drug Discovery Project and
it's run out of Delhi. It's, the government

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:23.530
funds it, the Indian government funds it partly
with a very, when you compare it to how much

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:29.840
it would cost big pharma to produce a drug
for TB, a fraction of the cost. And what they're

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:34.860
essentially doing, they call it Science 2.0
and what they're essentially doing is collecting

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:42.921
all the TB research from all over the country
and putting it online and trying to make sense

00:26:42.921 --> 00:26:49.730
of it in a way that might help lead to a TB
drug later down the line.

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:57.710
One of the things that they're trying to do
is annotate the TB genome, and if anyone knows,

00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:03.220
this is a long process. It's basically explaining
how the TB genome works and how it's built

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:07.780
and it can take many months to do it. But
given that they had all these researchers,

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:15.710
disparate researchers the OSDD team got together
and said, "How about if we ask Indian students

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:19.870
to each take a small section of the genome
and annotate it?" So that's what they did.

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:25.530
They got thousands of students from all over
the country, obviously post-grad and qualified

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:30.789
students because it's not an easy, it's a
specialized job. And yet because of Indian's

00:27:30.789 --> 00:27:36.250
vast geeky manpower, they can do this. And
they got them all together and within a few

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:41.570
months they had annotated the genome, which
is incredibly quick. They still have to verify

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:47.270
it and check it and make sure that it's all
fine, but as a model for doing very fast biology

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:49.570
it's incredibly efficient.

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:55.870
And companies have been so excited about it.
One Indian IT company, Emphasis, has offered

00:27:55.870 --> 00:28:00.990
to give their expertise for free. So they're
offering to design a semantic Web platform

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:05.630
where all this research can be made sense
of so that they can use it to develop a new

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:08.970
drug. And they're fairly confident they will
develop a new drug out of it.

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:17.510
So when I met the team, which was last spring,
2,700 people in India and overseas had registered

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:24.270
to be part of the group. And when I was writing
out the chapter -- from 53 different countries,

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:31.929
when I was writing up the chapter a few months
later that had gone up to 3,800 in 93 countries.

00:28:31.929 --> 00:28:40.000
So if you look at this, India is a poor country
and yet in an innovative way, it's overcoming

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:47.250
the fact that it has resource shortfalls by
taking advantage of its huge geeky manpower

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:52.450
and coming up with alternatives. This is completely
antithetical to the way science works.

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:59.370
Science, especially pharmaceutical science,
is about credit. It's about keeping research

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:03.610
maintained within a small company or a small
group so that you can make sure that you own

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:08.600
it at the end. And yet, these thousands of
scientists are willing to give up their credit

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:14.500
or share their credit, dilute it and work
together in order to come up to a solution

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:20.440
to a problem like this. Science isn't done
this way and it's interesting and I think

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:24.500
it shows a measure of innovation in India
that they came up with a solution like this

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.409
and that it is working.

00:29:27.409 --> 00:29:34.951
And it's not just pharmaceuticals or obvious
areas like biological research or medicine

00:29:34.951 --> 00:29:41.980
where things like this are happening. The
government, in the vein of Nehru's vision

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:47.700
for India to be a more scientific society,
are also trying to harness that geeky manpower

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:53.030
to improve the country as a whole. And to
illustrate that, I want to read another extract

00:29:53.030 --> 00:30:02.919
from the book. This is the last one. It's
from a chapter called "Geeks Rule" and it's

00:30:02.919 --> 00:30:08.210
about a city being built in the Western Ghats.
There's a picture of the Western Ghats behind

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:13.520
me. This an enormous range of hills just a
few hours' drive from Pune -- that's the nearest

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:17.570
city -- but quite isolated, very few people
live there.

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:23.140
"So the ground beneath our feet is always
moving. Two hundred million years ago South

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:30.049
America, Africa, India, Australia, and Antarctica
weren't where they are now but were part of

00:30:30.049 --> 00:30:37.440
one enormous supercontinent that spanned the
hemisphere. The split happened around thirty

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:43.480
million years later, after which they gradually
drifted into positions they occupy today.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:49.240
When this violent breakup happened, gigantic
volcanic ranges burst through the crust while

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:55.320
vast new oceans filled the gaps that the shifting
continents left behind. The earth looked like

00:30:55.320 --> 00:31:01.980
a pie that had been torn into slices. At its
edges, the land buckled and creased. In the

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:07.000
north of India, the Himalayas were created
and when Indian's west coast finally broke

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.309
free from the island of Madagascar, another
one of these geological creases became the

00:31:12.309 --> 00:31:14.010
Western Ghats.

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:20.320
Today, this 1,600 kilometer stretch of high
hills, blanketed in forest, is one of the

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:25.909
most remote places in the world. There are
at least 5,000 different types of flowers.

00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:33.610
Elephants, snakes, tigers, and cave bats all
live here, secluded from the rest of India.

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:38.620
Zoologists who have occasionally ventured
into the Ghats have found new species by the

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:45.190
handful. One time they discovered a dozen
multi-colored types of frog, a species that

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:52.279
was thought to have been extinct for a century.
The mountainous territory is inhospitable.

00:31:52.279 --> 00:31:58.679
The second I cross into it civilization disappears.
It's eerily silent in every direction, save

00:31:58.679 --> 00:32:01.289
a cry from the odd makak.

00:32:01.289 --> 00:32:06.370
And yet here in the middle of the Western
Ghats, in what can reasonably be called 'nowhere'

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:13.610
I descend into a steep valley and find myself
in one of the most advanced cities on earth.

00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:18.620
I arrive in the evening, just in time to catch
dinner at one of the first restaurants in

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:24.740
this half built metropolis. It's an American
style diner and I'm their only customer. There

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:30.210
are pictures of Lucille Ball and Betty Boop
on the walls and the floor is covered in black

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:33.059
and white checkerboard tiles.

00:32:33.059 --> 00:32:37.200
When they bring my food, they slide bottles
of French's yellow mustard and Heinz tomato

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:44.730
ketchup onto the countertop of my red leather
booth. This could be New York in the 1950s.

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:48.470
But this isn't the Twilight Zone, this is
a city of Lavasa.

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:54.169
I first read about it in an advertisement
in an in-flight magazine and became intrigued

00:32:54.169 --> 00:33:00.960
by what the advert claimed would be a metropolis
governed mainly by machines. A bank of centralized

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:06.990
computers, I read, will control everything
here from household security to the transport

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:12.920
network. It's a half billion dollar project
to build from scratch an urban dream in the

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:18.669
middle of the mountains. Even the roads leading
here have had to be carved out of the hills.

00:33:18.669 --> 00:33:22.789
It's the biggest thing to happen to the Western
Ghats since the cretaceous period."

00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:28.740
So you can imagine how weird it was for me
to turn up, to drive for two hours in the

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:35.360
night and then turn up in the middle of a
hill and be eating omelets in an American

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:39.510
diner [laughs] with pitch black all around
me and nobody there because the workers had

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:41.460
gone home and nobody has moved into the city
yet.

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:46.309
So the interesting thing about this place,
like I said, is that it will be electronically

00:33:46.309 --> 00:33:51.690
governed -- that's the aim. It's completely
being built from scratch. So what they've

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:56.120
done is during the construction they've mapped
everything in layers. So everything from the

00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:03.680
water pipes to where the houses are, the foundations,
the broadband, everything has been designed

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:09.270
so that if there's a fault, they'll know exactly
where it is and they can go and fix it immediately.

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:17.020
And every house and apartment in this complex,
and I'll show you the complex here -- this

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:22.990
is a picture of the promenade at Lavasa. The
American diner is near the end. This is the

00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:27.169
only bit that was actually complete when I
got there. So you can imagine just this and

00:34:27.169 --> 00:34:30.480
then hills all around it.

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:35.200
Every apartment in there will have a kiosk
where even if you don't have access to the

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:41.669
Internet or your own computer, you'll be able
to use this kiosk to pay all your bills, make

00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:45.521
complaints if you have to, communicate with
other residents. It's an Internet for the

00:34:45.521 --> 00:34:52.889
entire city. And what the temporary manager
told me -- they're going to elect a mayor

00:34:52.889 --> 00:34:57.869
once the city gets running -- but what the
temporary manager told me was that this city

00:34:57.869 --> 00:35:04.730
will, the aim is to have as few people running
it as possible. Essentially it will run itself.

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:07.560
The geeks will rule, or the technology will
rule.

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:13.839
But then again, this is a private development.
It's really expensive to stay here. The houses

00:35:13.839 --> 00:35:20.190
have almost all been sold now I think, but
the population is capped at 300,000 and if

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:23.140
you want to live there then you have to pay
a high price. So a lot of the people who have

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:28.640
bought houses I understand, are actors and
actresses and IT moguls and stuff.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:36.490
But the principles that you can see here are
being rolled out across the whole of India

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:45.170
by the Indian government. So exactly the same
kind of thing is happening all over the country.

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:51.119
If you've ever been to India, you'll know
that it has very high levels of corruption

00:35:51.119 --> 00:35:58.089
and an incredibly frustrating bureaucracy.
It holds up everything. It actually cuts to

00:35:58.089 --> 00:36:04.860
the heart of how scientists work because the
corruption even travels as far as the university

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:10.400
level. So professors will get promoted because
of nepotism sometimes rather than actual merit.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:16.980
So in order for India to be a smoother society,
in order for it to be any kind of superpower

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:24.839
let alone scientific one, it needs to solve
this problem of a weak bureaucracy and corruption.

00:36:24.839 --> 00:36:31.200
And, of course, because it is a nation of
geeks, I think, they're digitizing everything

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.619
and that's their way of doing it -- geek government
just like in Lavasa.

00:36:34.619 --> 00:36:41.000
So since the early 1990s, there've been these
huge state run attempts to move government

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.520
records online. This has happened all over
the world for sure. In India, though, it's

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:50.661
happening in such a huge way, in a way that
stunned even me. So things like land records,

00:36:50.661 --> 00:36:57.050
birth records, birth certificates, death certificates,
are all going online and it means you can

00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:00.540
access them more easily. And this is where
it's being masterminded.

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:06.910
So the picture on the screen right now is
of Electronics Niketan which is the IT ministry

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:13.300
of India in Delhi. "Electronics Niketan" means
an electronics house, so it's literally electronics

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:14.300
house.

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:20.339
I'm not a big fan of Indian government ministries.
Every time I've gone to one, it's been really

00:37:20.339 --> 00:37:25.670
frustrating. You turn up. Usually they're
not there or they knock off at like three

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:32.690
o'clock so you miss them, huge lunch breaks.
I went to the Health Ministry many years ago

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:38.080
to do a story and while I was there waiting
for an official, who by the way gave me no

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:45.089
useful information, I got bitten by a poisonous
spider on my foot and my foot swelled up like

00:37:45.089 --> 00:37:47.160
a sweet potato which is ironic given that
was the Health Ministry.

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:50.700
So I was kind of scared. I was worried about
going to this building and I left with plenty

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:55.960
of time, early appointment to make sure that
they would see me. And it surprised me because

00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:00.380
it was like no ministry I'd ever been to.
I was shown in immediately. This place is

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:08.270
run like a well oiled machine. The second
I got there, I was told that most of the people

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:12.830
working there, or at least in the unit that
I was seeing, actually came from the private

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:18.290
sector. So they'd worked in the Indian IT
industry and now they wanted to help the government

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:22.730
make the country more streamlined and help
the bureaucracy, which is why they've gone

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:28.410
to work in this place. And it was incredible.
They answered all my questions straight away.

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:33.420
So one of the things they're doing in this
building is monitoring projects like Lavasa,

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:38.740
but also other examples of electronic governance
all over the country being run on the state

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:45.839
level to see where the best practice is. And
what they've come up with is a scheme very

00:38:45.839 --> 00:38:50.980
much like in the houses of Lavasa, you'll
have those kiosks. They're introducing kiosks

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:57.160
like that at the block level all across India.
So a block is about five or six villages,

00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:04.880
half a dozen villages. So every block will
have a kiosk operated by, in some states,

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:11.640
by women. It takes very little skill to be
able to operate a kiosk like that. And you'll

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.580
be able to pay all your bills there, everything.

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:19.450
So I visited, they're around I think halfway
through the scheme and, at the moment, they're

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:24.440
trying to get it into the very furthest reaches.
So there are some islands and there are some

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:28.150
states in the northeast that are very remote
and inhospitable. So they're working on that

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:29.150
right now.

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:35.080
But I went to visit one of the kiosks in Jaipur,
which is a city in Rajasthan on the tourist

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:41.390
trail. And I was a bit skeptical 'cause I've
grown up in Britain where IT projects always

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:47.270
seem doomed to failure [laughs]. They never
work and they've cost millions of pounds and

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:48.770
yet they never work.

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:56.070
And I got to this kiosk. It was a Sunday and
I expected there to be huge queues or if not

00:39:56.070 --> 00:40:01.540
huge queues, then nobody using it or really
bad records. And it turned out that already

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:07.750
that Sunday hundreds of people across the
state had already used the kiosks near them

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:13.320
to pay their bills. I saw one guy paying three
different bills: so a power bill, a mobile

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:21.020
bill, and a landline bill, I think it was,
in minutes. And you can't do that. You can't

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:24.680
even do that in Britain. You can't go to one
place and pay all your bills in one place.

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:29.119
So it is quite incredible what they've managed
to achieve.

00:40:29.119 --> 00:40:35.280
There aren't that many stats about how efficient
this program is yet because it's very early

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:42.550
days. But in 2008, the Ministry of IT here
did a survey that found that five out of the

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:48.800
ten states that had computerized their land
records by 2008 -- so that's just land records

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:54.800
which are the most contentious documents in
India, by the way. Many civil court suits

00:40:54.800 --> 00:41:02.380
are about land records. Bribes in those states
had reduced, had either reduced significantly

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:04.190
or been completely eliminated.

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:09.500
Now when you take into account that, according
to Transparency International, all the households

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:14.020
below the poverty line in India, so these
are poor households in India, together pay

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:21.670
more than $200 million in bribes every year,
the potential for that is huge. If it works,

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:27.740
then it's huge. And I'm not saying that it
will work, but it's exciting that India is

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:35.250
taking those steps and making those advances
and making the investment to make it work.

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:39.770
The thing that's making it work, of course,
is that it has the geeky manpower. It's built

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:45.349
up an expertise in doing Western IT outsourcing
projects to other governments, learned those

00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:49.480
lessons, and brought them back and are now
having those same people run the projects

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.060
themselves.

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:52.650
[pause]

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:54.980
So I'm nearly done.

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:59.560
The final thought I just want to leave you
with is that India, while India might not,

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:04.440
if you look at the stats, if you look at the
facts and figures, while it may not be making

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:10.349
a huge impact on scientific output at the
moment, I think India's proportion of scientific

00:42:10.349 --> 00:42:14.950
output is something as a share of the globe's
is something like three percent at the moment;

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:21.290
so not incredibly encouraging. It is on the
cusp of this revolution that's happening.

00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:26.460
They're trying to solve the problems, the
underlying problems, that will help the country

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:32.640
become a scientific superpower in the future.
They're creating this legion of geeks that

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:37.210
are going to help move that forward and I
really think this is what will give India

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:40.820
its edge in the next 10 or 20 years.

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:45.070
So if you look at scientific publications,
yes India is very low down. But when you think

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:51.720
that Japan, Germany, Britain, and France have
become steadily less productive since 2000

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:56.440
as a share of the world's output, if you look
at the graph, India's output has risen every

00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:03.570
single year like China's, although not at
the same rate as China's. In 2008, it published

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:08.450
53 percent more scientific papers than on
average in each of the five years that went

00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:15.260
before. So it's ramping up its investment
quite incredibly.

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:22.450
The biggest difference I think will be made
by the fact that the Indian government is

00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:30.680
planning to ramp up its proportion of GDP
spending on R &amp; D. So if you look at developed

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:35.490
countries and developing countries, developed
countries tend to spend around two percent

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:41.359
of GDP on R &amp; D, so that includes, Japan actually
spends a lot more than that, U.S. spends about

00:43:41.359 --> 00:43:47.580
that, UK spends about that. Whereas countries
like Brazil and China and South Africa -- China

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:51.810
is increasing but Brazil and South Africa
and India tend to spend around one percent.

00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:56.190
The government has made a commitment to enter
that two percent category. I can't say when

00:43:56.190 --> 00:44:00.200
that will happen; they were hoping it would
happen by next year. That's unlikely, but

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.589
it will happen soon.

00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:06.241
The picture on the slide is of Manmohan Singh
doing a V sign, but I chose it because it

00:44:06.241 --> 00:44:07.920
was a two, two percent. [laughs]

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:08.920
[laughter]

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:12.780
Although I'm sure that's not why he meant
when he did that.

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:18.620
He announced last year actually that 2012
would be India's year of science which is

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:20.790
great for the book, but I think also great
for India.

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:28.099
And so finally -- this is a very almost final
slide -- I love space rockets and it doesn't

00:44:28.099 --> 00:44:32.690
really serve a purpose but I wanted to show
you two pictures of space rockets quickly.

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:33.690
[laughs]

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:34.690
[laughter]

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:38.369
The first is, I went to the Indian Space Research
Organization in the book and I saw a rocket

00:44:38.369 --> 00:44:44.750
launch in South India which was just incredible
-- not of a rocket this scale. But the first

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:49.550
is a polar satellite launch vehicle which
is what carried India's first lunar probe

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:56.710
a couple of years ago which was a pretty good
success. And India's plan now is to send their

00:44:56.710 --> 00:45:02.230
first astronaut into space in 2015, which
is something in terms of individual nations

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:09.230
only three nations have done -- that's China,
U.S., and the Soviet Union. And that astronaut

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:13.720
or those astronauts will go up in a rocket
something like this which is a geosynchronous

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:17.320
satellite launch vehicle. It'll probably be
a bit bigger than that and so they're working

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:22.270
on that now, working on the technology just
not, not just the rocket technology but also

00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:26.670
making these things habitable which is actually
a huge scientific challenge.

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:31.609
And I think this demonstrates in terms of
space especially, demonstrate India's raw

00:45:31.609 --> 00:45:37.810
ambition when it comes to science and that
even though people might look at India and

00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:42.349
say, "Why is this poor country investing so
much in science and tech?" It is playing the

00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:46.880
long game, it is thinking about the far, far
future --

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:47.880
[pause[

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:48.880
and that's it.

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:49.880
Thank you.

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:50.880
[laughs]

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:51.880
[applause]

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:52.880
Are there any questions?

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:53.880
Yeah.

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:54.880
&gt;&gt;male #1: [unintelligible]

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:59.400
&gt;&gt;Angela Saini: Oh yeah we need the microphone
for the question.

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:07.300
&gt;&gt;male #1: Thank you for coming. I had a couple
questions sort of related to if there's any

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.150
signs of resistance or push back ?

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:10.150
&gt;&gt;Angela Saini: Yeah.

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:12.800
&gt;&gt;male #1: to this movement. For example when
you were speaking of Lavasa ?

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:13.800
&gt;&gt;Angela Saini: Yeah.

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:17.301
&gt;&gt;male #1: and the sort of wide spread E-government
proposals and so forth --

00:46:17.301 --> 00:46:18.301
&gt;&gt;Angela Saini: Um-hum.

00:46:18.301 --> 00:46:19.760
&gt;&gt;male #1: I think that's fantastic --

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:20.760
&gt;&gt;Angela Saini: Yeah.

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.260
&gt;&gt;male #1: I think that's wonderful to make
people's lives more efficient and so forth.

00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:26.880
But I'm also thinking there's somebody out
there thinking, "Wow, that's a bureaucrat

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:27.880
that's not getting paid."

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:28.880
&gt;&gt;Angela Saini: [laughs]

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:29.880
&gt;&gt;male #1: Those are bribes I'm not getting.

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:30.880
&gt;&gt;Angela Saini: Yeah.

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:35.560
&gt;&gt;male #1: And I should, if I can, derail
this as soon as possible."

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:36.750
&gt;&gt;Angela Saini: Yeah.

00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:43.030
&gt;&gt;male #1: So as an economic reason for push
back -- and the other is sort a more cultural

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:47.480
one and you can sort of see that here in the
United States where there's sort of the haves

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:48.580
and the have nots --

00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:49.590
&gt;&gt;Angela Saini: Yeah.

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:51.210
&gt;&gt;male #1: of technological progress --

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:52.210
&gt;&gt;Angela Saini: Um-hum.

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:57.582
&gt;&gt;male #1: and so forth and that has caused
something of a religious resurgence here in

00:46:57.582 --> 00:46:58.582
the United --

00:46:58.582 --> 00:46:59.582
&gt;&gt;Angela Saini: Yeah.

00:46:59.582 --> 00:47:03.650
&gt;&gt;male #1: States and other places and obviously
as you mentioned India already has this great,

00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:05.270
impressive religious history --

00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:06.270
&gt;&gt;Angela Saini: Yeah.

00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:11.540
&gt;&gt;male #1: and so I mean -- so one question
is -- is this, is this revolution going to

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:12.670
be equally distributed --

00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:13.670
&gt;&gt;Angela Saini: [laughs]

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:19.880
&gt;&gt;male #1: both geographically, politically,
and culturally and so forth? And then again

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:24.000
sort of a general question about have you
seen any signs of push back ?

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000
&gt;&gt;Angela Saini: Yeah.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.660
&gt;&gt;male #1: sort of on these movement forward.

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:32.410
&gt;&gt;Angela Saini: Yeah, actually about a third
of the book is about the resistance from religious

00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:40.290
groups and activists. There are many activists
in India who believe that the country, like

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:45.230
Mahatma Gandhi dreamed of it, would always
be this nation of farmers, that it would always

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:50.070
be largely agricultural place, which is completely
at odds with this idea that you should industrialize

00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:56.180
and it should become this nation of geeks.
And for them it will always be a nation of

00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:59.990
farmers, I think. So yeah, that resistance
does exist.

00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:05.140
In terms of the bribes, I mean the people
who take the bribes I think will be quite

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.680
stupid to then say, "No. We want our bribes
please don't do this." [laughs]

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:08.680
[laughter]

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:13.810
That would be quite odd, but I'm sure that
there are even in these big bureaucratic IT

00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:20.020
projects, people skimming off the top because
that's the nature in places like this, and

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:23.270
I'm sure that's the nature in big IT projects
all over the world. There's always someone

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:24.270
skimming off the top.

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:31.551
But at the same time, if it increases transparency,
which is what it's doing and if reduces corruption

00:48:31.551 --> 00:48:37.550
and bureaucracy because it reduces that distance
between the person and the government and

00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:42.619
the modes for those people to come in and
become middlemen -- which they had before

00:48:42.619 --> 00:48:49.050
and because of the Internet can't -- then
I think it will at least go some way to solving

00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:50.560
that problem for sure.

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:53.520
What was your other question? Was there another
question?

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:54.890
&gt;&gt;male #1: Cultural aspects.

00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:58.900
&gt;&gt;Angela Saini: There are, yeah. So in the
book I do give example. I mean the example

00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:06.480
I use in the book is of the debate over GM
food. So in the U.S. we, GM food is very widely

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:12.060
grown. In Europe, there's a huge resistance
to it. And in India, it's kind of half and

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:16.940
half. So they grow BT cotton at the moment
which is resistance to boll worm and they're

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:22.880
trying to introduce their first BT food crop
which is an aubergine brinjal, an eggplant.

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:28.849
And there's been huge resistance to it partly
because of activists, partly because of the

00:49:28.849 --> 00:49:35.210
way it's being done and it's thought to have
been controlled by commercial interests. So

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:39.240
whenever a new technology comes in, I think
people feel a bit reluctant about it. But

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:46.980
India and I think a lot of Asia actually is
surprisingly excited about the new.

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:53.000
So I gave a talk in New York the other day
and there was someone from South Korea in

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.520
the audience. And all the way through they
were nodding furiously, they were like, "Yeah,

00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:58.470
my parents made me play chess as well --

00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:59.470
[laughter]

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:05.180
and it was exactly like that in Korea." And
yeah there is, I mean in the West or at least

00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:09.730
in Britain where I've grown up, there is this
kind of skepticism and fear of new things

00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:15.280
and technology. Whereas in India not so much
I think people embrace it which is exciting.

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:22.980
&gt;&gt;male #2: How are the graduate research universities
doing? You mentioned the faculty. Are the

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:29.610
faculty, the research faculty improving and
is India doing anything to help that? Certainly

00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:31.950
the undergraduates coming out of there are
fantastic ?

00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:33.359
&gt;&gt;Angela Saini: Yeah.

00:50:33.359 --> 00:50:37.990
&gt;&gt;male #1: but most of the top students don't
go to there for the Ph.D.s --

00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:41.620
&gt;&gt;Angela Saini: No they don't. When I went
to the Indian Institute of Technology, they

00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:47.359
complained, the dean was complaining that
very few students stay on to do Ph.D.'s and

00:50:47.359 --> 00:50:51.430
certainly none of the good ones because they
can earn these huge massive salaries working

00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:55.859
for IT companies and multi-nationals. So there's
just no incentive for them to do that especially

00:50:55.859 --> 00:51:00.400
since India is not known for research. So
even if you did stay on, the facilities are

00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:04.339
so poor and the resources are so poor that
you couldn't really make a mark. But that

00:51:04.339 --> 00:51:10.280
is changing. So for example at IIT Delhi,
they're introducing programs now which will

00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:16.369
help you get funding, if not from the government
or from the college then from private sources.

00:51:16.369 --> 00:51:21.099
And providing these kinds of incentives for
students to stay on and do Ph.D.'s. I really

00:51:21.099 --> 00:51:26.790
hope that happens because that's what you
need to build a truly scientific country and

00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:31.320
that's where has India suffered all these
great undergraduates go to the U.S. and do

00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:38.750
their Ph.D.'s here and contribute to America's
scientific society and not to India's. But

00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:42.270
I'm convinced that that will change.

00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:43.270
[pause]

00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:44.270
[laughs]

00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:46.250
Are we done?

00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:52.030
&gt;&gt;commentator: Any questions on the VC just
before we wrap up?

00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:53.030
[pause]

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:55.790
No. Okay, thanks everyone. Thanks very much,
Angela, for coming.

00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:56.880
&gt;&gt;Angela Saini: Thank you.

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:57.150
[applause]
