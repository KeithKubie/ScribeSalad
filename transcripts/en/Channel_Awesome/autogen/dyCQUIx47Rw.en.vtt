00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.490 align:start position:0%
revenge for I think Julie's how do I put
this<00:05:26.380><c> I</c><00:05:26.530><c> think</c><00:05:26.830><c> Juhi</c><00:05:27.570><c> her</c><00:05:28.570><c> feelings</c><00:05:29.140><c> are</c><00:05:29.350><c> real</c>

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 align:start position:0%
this I think Juhi her feelings are real
 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.820 align:start position:0%
this I think Juhi her feelings are real
in<00:05:29.770><c> that</c><00:05:29.919><c> she's</c><00:05:30.190><c> just</c><00:05:30.460><c> frickin</c><00:05:31.060><c> sick</c><00:05:31.270><c> of</c><00:05:31.450><c> Eric</c>

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 align:start position:0%
in that she's just frickin sick of Eric
 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.350 align:start position:0%
in that she's just frickin sick of Eric
but<00:05:32.830><c> I</c><00:05:32.860><c> think</c><00:05:33.250><c> that</c><00:05:33.400><c> this</c><00:05:33.520><c> is</c><00:05:33.669><c> also</c><00:05:33.850><c> part</c><00:05:34.180><c> of</c><00:05:34.240><c> a</c>

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
but I think that this is also part of a
 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.750 align:start position:0%
but I think that this is also part of a
ruse<00:05:34.600><c> so</c><00:05:34.900><c> if</c><00:05:35.560><c> she</c><00:05:35.740><c> gets</c><00:05:35.860><c> to</c><00:05:36.100><c> do</c><00:05:36.220><c> this</c><00:05:36.370><c> ruse</c><00:05:36.610><c> and</c>

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
ruse so if she gets to do this ruse and
 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.850 align:start position:0%
ruse so if she gets to do this ruse and
also<00:05:37.060><c> make</c><00:05:37.240><c> Varrick</c><00:05:37.900><c> think</c><00:05:38.169><c> that</c><00:05:38.380><c> he's</c><00:05:38.650><c> been</c>
