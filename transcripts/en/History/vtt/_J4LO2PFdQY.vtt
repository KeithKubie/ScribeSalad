00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:01.334
Oh yeah!

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:07.048
Check you out, Davy Deals.

00:00:07.048 --> 00:00:11.428
Oh my gosh, dude.

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:12.387
My latest toy.

00:00:12.387 --> 00:00:13.513
This is yours?

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:15.932
I buy them and drive them!

00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:17.559
- This is really yours?
- Yeah.

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:18.560
I mean, I know--

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.519
come here.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:20.729
How are you, brother man?

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:22.230
Good to see you, Davy.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.982
I mean, I know you were
looking for a muscle car,

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:26.526
but this thing is
actually super cool now.

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:27.485
It's a Falcon.

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:28.945
'69 Falcon, Ford.

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:30.029
'69?

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.824
Bro, I'm shocked right now.

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:36.286
NARRATOR: Ford debuted the
small, economic Falcon in 1959

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:39.873
for the 1960 model year as a
response to a growing recession

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:42.000
and the immense popularity
of cheap imports

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.544
like the Volkswagen Beetle,
and it immediately began

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:46.337
outselling the competition.

00:00:46.337 --> 00:00:49.716
Ford beat them to the punch
when it came to naming, as well.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:52.010
Unknown to each other,
both Ford and Chrysler

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.721
were developing small
cars to be named Falcons,

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.182
but Ford registered the
name with the Automobile

00:00:57.182 --> 00:01:00.935
Manufacturers Association just
20 minutes ahead of Chrysler,

00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:02.395
winning the naming rights.

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:04.314
The Falcon platform
would eventually

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:08.026
evolve into the first
generation Ford Mustang.

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:10.612
This is a great
looking car, man.

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:13.656
I was shooting for a
GTO, but got the Ford.

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:15.867
Well, you know, I'm an
equal opportunity guy.

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:17.994
You know how much I
love old Fords as well,

00:01:17.994 --> 00:01:19.746
and this is basically
a Mustang under here.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.372
Right.
Pretty cool, huh?

00:01:21.372 --> 00:01:22.916
It's tough.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.542
What's under the
hood of this baby?

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:27.378
It's 351 Windsor.

00:01:27.378 --> 00:01:29.547
Kind of hit it, pick.

00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:31.508
Oh, dude.

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:34.928
It's Cobra, so they
built it out to a 408.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:36.095
Stroke it out.

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:37.806
Yeah, so it's
got some high RPM.

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:39.724
This is very
clean and very cool.

00:01:39.724 --> 00:01:41.684
I love the install
and I love the hood.

00:01:41.684 --> 00:01:43.645
I love the scoop.

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:44.729
What's the tranny?

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.649
The trannys a C4 Ford.

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.108
Boom.
- Nice.

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:50.485
It's a light little car, too.

00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:51.903
Oh, dude, they
don't weigh anything.

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:53.363
They don't weight
nothing for the horsepower

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:55.073
that this thing is putting out.

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:57.826
What's the chances of taking
me for a ride at this rate?

00:01:57.826 --> 00:01:58.993
- Let's go.
- Really?

00:01:58.993 --> 00:01:59.869
Let's get the
live lock lit up.

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.037
Really?

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:01.913
Yeah it's got
a full live lock.

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:02.956
I wanna go for a ride.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.165
All right, hop in.
Cool.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.466
There we go.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.016
You know what's really
impressive about this car?

00:02:22.016 --> 00:02:23.726
How solid it is.

00:02:23.726 --> 00:02:26.729
There's no rattles, there's no
squeaks, there's no nothing.

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:27.814
Rock solid.

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:29.858
And for a hot rod?

00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:30.817
Come on, man.

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.235
This thing moves.

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:34.195
Hang a right here at
the barbecue joint.

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:36.656
Yeah!

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:42.954
My man Davy Deals, he
knows how to pick 'em, man.

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:46.249
And driving around in this baby
has definitely cleared my head.

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.418
This is all about the fun.

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:50.461
NARRATOR: Now it's time
to get back to the shop

00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:52.380
and get back to work.
