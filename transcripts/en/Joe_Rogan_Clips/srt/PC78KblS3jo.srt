1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:00,960
Happen,

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,960
the Joe Rogan experience and our fears
that you were just discussing earlier

3
00:00:06,511 --> 00:00:11,511
about how soft we are in comparison to
the past civilizations in terms of like

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,380
our ability to live off the land.
That's one aspect that bothers me,

5
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:19,620
but one of the big ones that bothers me
is the fact that everything is digital.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,540
All of our information is stored on hard
drives. You Bet. And if that goes down,

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,980
there's not much left. You've
paper books and, and you know,

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,330
a few thousands of years,
imagine what will be left. Yeah,

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,640
we would lose all of our advancement.

10
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,130
Well, I can, I can speak to this
at, at uh, at, at a personal level,

11
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,250
there was a time when I
was an excellent map redo.

12
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,290
I could navigate anywhere
with, with maps, you know,

13
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:52,291
my wife Santha an I did huge Jenny's in
Mexico back in the early 1990s in really

14
00:00:52,421 --> 00:00:57,421
cheap hire cars with maps and we found
our way everywhere without any problem

15
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,610
today I can hardly use a map.

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,080
The skill of using a map has lapsed
within me. Why? Because of GPS,

17
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,140
GPS technology has come along and it's,
and it,

18
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:13,010
it always tells me where I
am and being a bit lazy, uh,

19
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,710
I just accept that, that technology,
but then I had caused to us myself,

20
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:19,750
there's just the other day supposing gps,

21
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,020
supposing all the satellites go down
and there's no, no gps is the whole,

22
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,650
the whole industrialized human
race is going to suddenly be lost.

23
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,730
All those Uber drivers who don't know
their way from a to B and who rely

24
00:01:30,731 --> 00:01:34,150
entirely on their gps is they won't know.
They won't know where they're going.

25
00:01:34,151 --> 00:01:37,720
And it's, and it's true with digital
data. The digital digital data,

26
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,750
unlike unlike print data is very fragile
and requires programs in order to

27
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:48,940
access and interpret it that are much
more complicated than simply cracking the

28
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:50,260
code of a,
a lost language.

29
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,890
Do you don't mean their programs vary
between different phone platform? Exactly.

30
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,560
Very computer platforms. It's
just, it's so fragile and it's so,

31
00:01:58,561 --> 00:01:59,550
uh,
I mean,

32
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:02,220
I don't know if there's any precautions
that have been taken place to preserve

33
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:06,480
this information in case of like what
Robert Schoch describes coronal mass

34
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:07,410
ejection or something,

35
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,710
then click down all the satellites.
Yeah. No, I don't think,

36
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:12,440
I don't think preparation has been
made and I don't, and I don't,

37
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:17,390
and it's very clear that that preparation
is not being made for the risk of

38
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,710
another, a cosmic impact.
Um, uh, and again, a,

39
00:02:21,711 --> 00:02:25,070
a point that I'd like to make
about this is that we are at,

40
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,410
we are in a sense in a place where
history can repeat itself, uh,

41
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:33,500
that there are certain cycles at work.
Uh,

42
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:37,310
the work on the comet impact 12,000,
800 years ago.

43
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:42,610
How has very clearly and specifically
identified the debris trail at that

44
00:02:42,891 --> 00:02:43,580
comment.

45
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,580
And that Debbie trail is the Taurid
meteor stream and it's called the Taurid

46
00:02:48,651 --> 00:02:51,950
meteor stream because it
appears to emanate from the
region of the sky in which

47
00:02:51,951 --> 00:02:56,600
the constellation of Taurus sits. It
doesn't, it's within our solar system.

48
00:02:56,601 --> 00:02:57,770
It's an optical illusion.

49
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,650
The Taurid stream is a
giant complex of debris.

50
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,910
Uh,
it is 30 million kilometers wide.

51
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,650
What you had was an original comment
that might have been a hundred to 200

52
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:12,790
kilometers in diameter,

53
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,870
a small moon which fragmented
and broke up into multiple,

54
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:21,640
multiple parts and those parts began to
spread out along the whole orbit of the

55
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:25,120
Taurid meteor stream.
And to widen the whole thing widens.

56
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,380
So it's like a giant tube of debris and
the evidence and the argument is that

57
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:31,090
12,000,
800 years ago,

58
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,830
several large bits of that debris fell
out of the Taurid meteor stream and

59
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:37,300
impacted with the earth.

60
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,540
The problem is that the tour of meteor
stream still exists and our planets still

61
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:45,320
passes through it twice a year.
Uh,

62
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:50,330
and those passages take place in June
and in November and each passage takes 12

63
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:54,160
and a half days and the same
group of scientists who are,

64
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:58,900
who are looking at the evidence for
the impacts 12,800 years ago are deeply

65
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:03,280
concerned that we may face future
impacts from the tour of meteor stream.

66
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,970
That there are still large objects up
there. This is not theory. This is a fact.

67
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:10,090
There's a comet up there,
uh, called comet Encke,

68
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,370
which is part of the Taurid meteor stream.

69
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,290
It's a large fragment of the
original giant comment comment.

70
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,890
Danky has a diameter of, I dunno, five
or five or six kilometers. There's,

71
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:23,891
there's 19 recognized huge objects within
the Taurid meteor stream calculations

72
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:28,450
indicate that there may be as much as
200 asteroids within the Taurid meteor

73
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:31,120
stream of a diameter
of a kilometer or more,

74
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:33,220
which would have
catastrophic effect if they,

75
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,330
if they hit the earth and responsible
astronomers regard the Taurid meteor

76
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:40,600
stream as the greatest collision hazard
facing mankind at the present time.

77
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,580
And it's not something that we need to
fall into despair about because it's

78
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:50,020
perfectly within the level of our
technology to do something about it.

79
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,810
What could they do? Well,
to give you an example,

80
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,470
a commercial interests are looking right
now and the technology is there to mine

81
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:58,600
asteroids. We can go to asteroids. If the,

82
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:02,770
if the commercial interest is high enough,
we can go to them, we can mine them,

83
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:04,960
we can extract minerals,
we can bring them back to the earth.

84
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,880
The same technology would allow you
to move asteroids or comet fragments.

85
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:12,520
You don't want to blow
them up with a nuke.

86
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,910
That would be a really bad idea
that would, that would, uh,

87
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,890
turn one large object into
multiple smaller objects,

88
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:24,670
which could cause equally massive
devastation and would be very difficult to

89
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:26,770
predict where that
devastation was going to fall.

90
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,240
What you want to do is to nudge them
and moved them out of a dangerous orbit

91
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:33,510
into, into a less
dangerous orbit. And, and,

92
00:05:33,511 --> 00:05:35,380
and the evidence is in the next 30 years,

93
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:38,710
we are going to be passing through
dangerous filaments of the Taurid meteor

94
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:40,060
stream.
And if we were smart,

95
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:44,410
we would be devoting some resources
to protecting our cosmic environment.

96
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,620
Just as we, there are many issues
that we need to devote resources to.

97
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,060
Unfortunately,

98
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,800
the one that's most attractive to our
politicians at the moment is warfare. Uh,

99
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,970
we devote limitless resources to
technologies of mass destruction.

100
00:05:59,450 --> 00:05:59,611
There.

101
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:03,710
There really is no end to the amount
that we're prepared to spend on that in

102
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:05,390
terms of our so called security.

103
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:09,410
We feel somehow we're making ourselves
more secure by having these incredible

104
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,590
weapons and spending
trillions of dollars on them.

105
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,710
But the cosmos doesn't give
a fuck about any of that.

106
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:20,400
The Cosmos is out there with these,
with these giant giant objects, uh,

107
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:25,220
which have a far greater explosive
power than all the nuclear, um,

108
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,640
weapons stored on earth at the,
at the present time, the comments,

109
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:33,660
you shoemaker levy nine which hit
Jupiter in 1994 had a total calculated

110
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:36,980
explosive power of 300 gigatons.

111
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:41,060
If you took the entire nuclear arsenal
of the world today and blew it all up at

112
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:43,640
once,
it would yield 6.4 gigatons.

113
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,470
So these objects are producing
catastrophic results on a scale that far,

114
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,590
far beyond anything that we ourselves
could do with nuclear weapons.

115
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:56,180
It's time we spent a bit less time and
money on weapons of mass destruction and

116
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:59,930
a bit more on looking after this
beautiful garden that we call the earth.

117
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,380
And that is our home and it will be the
home of our children and our children's

118
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,530
children. I'm a grandfather now.
I feel passionately about this.

119
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,390
We need to look after this planet.

120
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:12,830
It's our responsibility as a human species
to do so. And one of the challenges,

121
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:15,770
it's not the only challenge. There
are many, many other challenges.

122
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,450
One of the challenges is to pay attention
to our cosmic environment and to

123
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:25,451
realize that the cosmos can intervene
cataclysmically in the human story.

124
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,930
And that the tour of meteor stream in
particular may have been a hidden hand in

125
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:33,530
human history that there may have been
other impacts in the last 13,000 years

126
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,910
that affect have affected and changed
the course of humanity on this earth.

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,300
And the ancients were very good
at paying attention to the sky.

128
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,050
We ourselves have amazing
tech to study the sky,

129
00:07:45,051 --> 00:07:48,980
but for some reason were ignoring
this problem of cosmic impact.

130
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:52,160
And that's incredibly irresponsible
because as I said a moment ago,

131
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:56,570
it is a solvable problem.
It is within the limits of our technology.

132
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,430
It would require a global cooperative
effort to sweep our cosmic environment

133
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:02,030
clean.

134
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,020
But it could be done and a side product
of that global corporation might be a

135
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:10,490
friendlier, more nurturing, more
loving, more positive human community.

136
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,140
It is very odd that we have
this infant town nature,

137
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:18,770
even as grown adults and
world leaders that we don't,

138
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:23,771
we do like to nor imminent danger as long
as it hasn't effected us in the past.

139
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,793
Yes,

140
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:29,950
there's no real moment we can point to
other than tongue goose SCA in you know,

141
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:31,460
photographic history,

142
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,780
modern history where you
could take pictures of things
when we had an agenda and

143
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:37,220
if I can,
if I can pause you on that very point.

144
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,110
The evidence is compelling that the
Tunguska event was an object that fell out

145
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:45,300
of the Taurid meteor stream that
happened at the peak of the Bita tour.

146
00:08:45,301 --> 00:08:46,790
It's in June,

147
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:51,790
1900 and eight that it's extremely likely
that that Tunguska object came from

148
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:55,560
the Taurid meteor stream because we
were passing through the Taurid meteor

149
00:08:55,561 --> 00:08:58,600
stream at exactly that time.
And what are the tongue Glusker?

150
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,540
Object is estimated to be between
60 and 190 meters in diameter.

151
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,960
So it's not a very big object. It's not
a kilometer scale object. It's a, it's,

152
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:11,070
it's, it's big, but it's not that big.
It doesn't even hit the earth. It,

153
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,210
it's an air burst.

154
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:16,650
It explodes in the sky above fortunately,

155
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:20,940
and uninhabited area of Siberia.
But the devastation is huge.

156
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:24,930
It wasn't even noticed for some years
afterwards until scientific teams went in

157
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,920
and studied the area and discovered
that 80 million trees across 2000 square

158
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:33,020
kilometers had been completely
flattened by that airburst. Uh,

159
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,930
and to put that in context, 2000 square
kilometers is the size of London.

160
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,250
So anybody who knows London is aware
that there's a ring road around London

161
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:45,090
called the m 25 if that air best
had taken place over central London,

162
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,440
everything of London out as far as the
m 25 would have been gone completely.

163
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,830
Is that what it looks like today?
Pretty close. Pretty close.

164
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,720
There's like a hundred years later,
there's still no trees. Yeah. And,

165
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,530
and if you've got, you're
looking at, I've parked there,

166
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,780
you're looking at the black and whites
that were taken in the early 19 hundreds.

167
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,970
Yeah. Which, which revealed the
extent of this, uh, of this damage.

168
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:09,240
So it's just stupid of us not to
pay a bit more attention to this,

169
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:13,590
especially when we have the
tech to actually do something
about it. We have that,

170
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,480
that nature though, when it comes to
climate debt, there's a curious denial.

171
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,170
There's a denial, um, of
the role of capitalism's in
the human story. And there,

172
00:10:23,171 --> 00:10:28,170
there is even a word for that in, in
science and it's called uniformitarianism.

173
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,641
And,

174
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:32,910
and this is a particular philosophy of
science where the view is that everything

175
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:36,390
is, we see it in the world today
is how things have always been.

176
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,890
So if we don't see cataclysms today and
they're not playing a major part in our

177
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:43,590
story today,
then there weren't cataclysms.

178
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:47,460
And they didn't play a major part in
our story in the past. That's why,

179
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,710
although it's before the
time of human beings,

180
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:54,420
when the evidence that the dinosaurs
were made extinct by a comet or an

181
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:58,800
asteroid, a first came out,
um, Lewis and Walter Alvarez,

182
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:02,550
the father son team who were behind
that science were ridiculed by their

183
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:06,090
colleagues and they were told him,
absolutely observed. Of course,

184
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:09,000
no cosmic event could have
made the dinosaurs extinct.

185
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,020
They spent 10 years taking that ridicule
until they found the crater in the Gulf

186
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:14,610
of Mexico.
Since then,

187
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,470
the whole scientific community has
accepted that the course of life on this

188
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:24,390
planet was radically changed
by a cosmic impact. Um,

189
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,160
you know,
I like to joke about it,

190
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:30,690
but it was a cosmic impact that was big
enough literally to turn dinosaurs into

191
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:35,100
chickens because that's what's left
of the time. So align is, you know,

192
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,100
the birds,
and at the same time,

193
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:43,590
skulking in those primeval forests is
this little mammal and it looks a bit like

194
00:11:43,591 --> 00:11:47,940
a shrew,
a 65 million years ago going nowhere.

195
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,810
The dinosaurs ruled the earth.
Then the cosmos intervenes.

196
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,220
The dinosaurs are swept out of the way.
And what happens,

197
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:58,150
the mammals start to evolve very rapidly
and they start to occupy niches that

198
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:02,530
were previously closed to them. And the
bottom line is we would not be here.

199
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:04,030
The human species would not be here.

200
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:07,420
We would not be having this conversation
if the dinosaurs had not been made

201
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:12,310
extinct 65 million years ago. Uh,
so these are, we'll changing events.

202
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:17,311
And my argument is that such a wheelchair
in event occurred between twelve

203
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:17,681
thousand eight hundred and eleven
thousand six hundred years ago,

204
00:12:17,681 --> 00:12:20,290
and it's high time.
We paid more attention to it.
