00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.252
So, it was great to hear from a real user and to hear her describe her

00:00:03.252 --> 00:00:05.291
attributes, use cases, and see how that really

00:00:05.291 --> 00:00:07.630
played into the feature that she loved the most.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:08.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah and let's look at dorm room

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.210
Debbie again. We have her attributes and use cases

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.780
here. What features do you think she would like,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.210
in her perfect pizza ordering application? Do you think

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.690
she would like to split the bill? Do

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.190
you think she'd like delivery? Or pick-up? Would she

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.500
be into coupons? Or would she want to know

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.915
the name of the farmer that made the dough?

00:00:24.915 --> 00:00:27.000
[LAUGH]. Or would she want multiple payment

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.960
options? Or perhaps hi-res photos of the ingredients?

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.830
&gt;&gt; So check all that apply that would make the perfect feature list for Debbie.
