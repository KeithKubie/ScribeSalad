00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.170
If we just hung out here in silence for a
second…

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.430
Yep, we’re both still breathing.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.430
Whew.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.400
It has a lot of names: hypoxic drive, respiration,
breathing… needless to say, you know what

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.530
it is.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.499
It’s this.

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:16.010
But have you ever thought about it?

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.520
I mean not in the way that you’re thinking
about breathing now.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.520
HA.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.520
Deal with that.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.369
But have you thought about how your body does
this when you’re asleep, when you’re distracted

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.169
or really focused.

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.369
No matter what you’re doing (for the most
part) your body is breathing for you.

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.700
That drive to breathe is strong.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.630
The reason you can do it without thinking
is because your brainstem is doing the work

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.750
and making the decisions.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.980
But we’ll come back to that in a sec.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.260
Breathing is a really complex balance of pulling
oxygen in from the environment, and getting

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.800
carbon dioxide out of your blood.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.120
Even though we need oxygen to survive, the
main influencer of the drive to breathe isn’t

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:59.290
oxygen, but CO2 -- or really, CO2’s tendency
to dissolve into water.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.411
Out in the world, carbon dioxide binds with
H2O to create carbonic acid… it’s why

00:01:03.411 --> 00:01:05.950
a glass of water left overnight tastes funny.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.250
It’s gots CO2 in it.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.120
The more CO2 there is in your blood, the more
acidic it is.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.520
The brain doesn’t like blood that’s too
acidic or too basic, so it needs to monitor

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.520
it constantly.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.360
That’s why, spread throughout all this are
chemoreceptors … central chemorteceptors

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.670
are in your brain … peripheral chemoreceptors
are in the body’s blood vessels.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.760
Those receptors sense subtle shifts in the
levels of carbon dioxide and the acidity of

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.340
your blood, and send that info to the respiratory
centers in the medulla of your brain stem.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.850
Based on the acidity readings from those chemoreceptors,
your brain directs your lungs to make little

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.870
adjustments in your rate of breathing to try
and keep your CO2 levels as steady as possible.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.130
It happens all the time.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.760
Now you’re thinking about your breathing
again.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.760
HA!

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.760
Here’s the fun part.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.420
If you’re say, HYPOventilating, HYPER in
medical context makes sense -- it’s FAST.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.600
HYPO is the opposite.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.600
Slow…

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.810
So you’re HYPOventilating…

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.870
When that happens, the CO2 level goes up,
and your brain wants to get rid of it!

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.149
So, it drives you to breathe more.

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.370
That’s called the hypercapnic drive to breathe…

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.459
HYPO - HYPER.

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.709
Thus if you’re HYPERventilating, then your
carbon dioxide level goes down… that’s

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.400
called HYPOcapnia… the drive to breathe
goes down as well.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.840
This all makes sense.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.180
And yet, we wouldn’t be humans if we didn’t
see something working beautifully and say,

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.299
“Hold my beer.”

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.720
The hypoxic drive is part of the autonomic
nervous system -- pupil dilation, heartbeat,

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.500
breathing, digestion -- all that stuff.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.700
It’s like the Morlocks of the civilization
that is your body.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.700
Nerd reference.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.700
Anyway.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.069
Sometimes people try to trick their brains
and create a state of HYPOcapnia -- low CO2,

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.709
remember? -- by hyperventilating on purpose.

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.120
I’m talking about Freedivers.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.599
To hold their breath for a long time, some
freedivers will hyperventilate before ducking

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:57.809
into the water.

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:00.930
They can stay underwater longer BUT!!

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.749
BIG B-U-T.

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:07.560
This hypocapnic state can cause a phenomenon
called “ascent blackout” which is deadly.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.299
Basically, the hyperventilation makes you
get rid of more carbon dioxide, making you

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.040
want to breathe slower.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.409
But, while underwater, you’re not replacing
O2, for obvious reasons.

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:24.439
Remember, your brain isn’t as driven by
the need for O2 as it is driven by clearing

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:25.439
CO2.

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:31.299
So, after a bit with low CO2 levels and decreasing
O2 levels, the diver runs out of oxygen to

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.239
burn, and passes out.

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.739
All without the brain ever triggering the
sympathetic nervous system to kick in and

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:38.739
breathe.

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.140
Instead, the diver has to surface and intentionally
take a breath in time.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.430
This is super dangerous.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.680
DON’T DO IT.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.680
SERIOUSLY.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.680
Don’t.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.560
This can even happen in shallow water… it’s
called shallow water blackout.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.689
And people die.

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:56.090
Of course, even though CO2 is the driver,
oxygen still matters!

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.579
The brain does monitor oxygen levels.

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.169
If they drop really low, the body will kick
that drive to breathe again.

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:06.260
But this matters more at high altitudes where
there’s less air -- that’s a whole other

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.260
thing.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.769
Look, the bottom line here is -- when you’re
not thinking about breathing your body is

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.959
doing LOTS OF THINGS to keep you alive.

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.019
Respiration is a base function of a living
thing.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.359
So, we’re really good at doing this even
when we’re distracted by our phones, or

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.280
are driving, or sleeping!

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.000
The body is such a cool machine.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.960

The body doesn’t just need oxygen -- we
also need food; and if you’re going to eat,

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.190
you may as well learn too!

00:04:49.190 --> 00:05:07.760
Our friends at Thrillist just launched their
brand new show Food/Groups!

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.490
My buddy Dave Infante is going to talk to
food experts as they hunt down a dish that’s

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.590
authentically tied to a different neighborhood,
nationality, or lifestyle.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.120
Check out an episode here if you love food
and love learning about humans, cultures and

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.120
awesomeness!

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.379
Are you still thinking about breathing?

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:27.220
