[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:12.560
GELONG THUBTEN: Thank you.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.520
Thank you.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:22.710
So I'd like to start by talking
about the concept of freedom.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.550
I think the term "freedom,"
the concept of freedom,

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.200
is something that is
very important to us.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.540
We're very passionate in
our search for freedom

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.090
and in our defense of
our rights of freedom.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.150
And we fought very hard for many
centuries to achieve a certain

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.540
level of freedom, which in
many ways has been achieved,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.379
in many ways hasn't.

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:49.920
But what I'm interested
in addressing

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.050
is the fact that even
though we may have

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.580
a certain degree of external
freedom in terms of how we live

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.850
our lives, in terms of how
we dress, what we believe in,

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.970
what we do with
our time, there's

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.940
a deeper aspect
to freedom that I

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.300
think is more important, which
is deep down in our minds,

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.450
how free are we.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.400
So if we look at our mind
and we see how often it does

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.200
things we don't want it to do--

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.800
often, our mind goes to places
we don't want it to go--

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.370
thoughts, emotions,
memories, worries.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.360
So the mind is not behaving
in a way we want it to behave.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.860
And also, the opposite--

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.780
very often, our mind does
things or goes to places

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.180
we don't want it to go to--

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:58.140
worries, obsessive planning,
painful memories, reactions.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.100
When we're sitting in
a car stuck in traffic,

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.580
and then we find ourselves
reacting negatively--

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.180
feeling impatient,
feeling upset--

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.360
this is beyond our
intellect, isn't it?

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.640
We don't plan that reaction.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.732
Or when somebody says something
to us that we don't like,

00:02:16.732 --> 00:02:19.980
and we feel hurt, we feel upset.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.690
We don't plan the reaction.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.470
So in many ways, we are not
in control of our minds.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.510
And of course, you discover
this really strongly

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.400
when you try to meditate.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.360
Anybody who meditates discovers
within five minutes, or five

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.420
seconds, the lack of control.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.940
We're trying to sit there
and focus on our breathing,

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.040
for example.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.150
And within seconds, the mind
is planning menus, or writing

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.310
emails, or plotting revenge.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.090
I don't know.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.020
The mind is going to
places constantly.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:05.160
So there's this lack of
freedom, this lack of choice.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.740
And then when it
comes to happiness,

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.870
the same thing seems
to be the case--

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.480
that we don't know how
to choose happiness.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.070
It's almost as if
we have to hope

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.680
that happiness will choose us.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.170
You know what I mean?

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.800
And also, our
quest for happiness

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.810
is very much based
on external things.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.780
Very often, we think
happiness will come from,

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.880
and then there's a whole list--

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.030
people, places, situations.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.410
Happiness comes
from those things.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.030
And so then we are
left hoping that we

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.260
can manipulate our life
to a certain degrees

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.490
so that happiness will arise.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.150
But of course, it's
beyond our control.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.370
And also, I think,
for many people,

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.850
the definition of
happiness is very much

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.270
based on a sensation, a
kind of quick sensation,

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.529
almost like a buzz.

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:07.320
We have this kind of--
we want to get high.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.250
We want to feel something.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.530
Our idea of happiness
is a sensation

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.910
that is triggered by something,
and then we feel good.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.510
And of course, the problem
with that is it doesn't last.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.160
So we feel good,
then we feel bad.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.510
It's very unstable.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.940
So when our happiness depends
on an external trigger,

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.010
then the problem is when
the trigger is absent,

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.770
the happiness is absent.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.470
And we're just, in a
way, lurching from one

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.010
high to the next, looking for a
buzz, looking for a sensation.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.150
And so much of the way we
construct our lives now

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.450
is based on that with our
use of the internet, even

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.660
food, caffeine,
different experiences.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.230
We construct our life to
give us these sensations that

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.890
make us feel good.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.690
But the problem is the more
we are hoping that happiness

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.120
will come to us
from the outside,

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.460
the more we feel lacking inside.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.000
In a way, we're
telling ourselves

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.050
that we are deficient.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.900
I need this.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:14.520
I need that.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.030
I need that.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.080
Then I'll be happy.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.440
So we're creating
a feeling of lack,

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.900
that we lack that happiness.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.740
We're creating a deficiency
or sense of almost despair,

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.090
and this becomes very painful.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.030
And then also, the wanting
and the grasping and craving

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.100
that we experience becomes
a habit that creates more

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.590
wanting, grasping, and craving.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.970
So the wanting leads
to more wanting,

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.370
and then we feel
never satisfied,

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.360
because whatever we
get isn't enough,

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.520
because we're perpetuating
the habit of wanting.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.190
So then we're jumping
over the experience,

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.270
looking for the next thing.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:06.030
So we feel this unsettled
quality in our lives,

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.290
almost like a fear or a
feeling of uncertainty.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.990
And this feeds us to want more.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.810
So it's a very vicious cycle.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.240
And then all the things
that we depend upon

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.680
for our happiness are,
of course, impermanent.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.940
They're subject to change.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.000
So there's a feeling
of uncertainty

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.630
because we're depending
on the unreliable.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.340
And we kind of know that.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.350
We kind of know that
everything we depend upon

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.720
for our happiness is
unreliable because

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.782
of its changeable nature.

00:06:39.782 --> 00:06:40.990
So we have two problems here.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.760
We have the problem
of endless wanting

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.980
and the problem of
depending on the unreliable.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.450
So this kind of happiness
hasn't worked for us.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.450
It hasn't given us peace.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:00.800
It's just made us more
exhausted, more frustrated.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.620
And I think, through
meditation training,

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.640
we can find a very
different approach.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.770
Basically, we're looking
for something different--

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.330
happiness from the inside.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.580
We're recognizing that
happiness and suffering

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.050
are states of mind.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.740
So of course, they are triggered
by all kinds of situations.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.530
But ultimately, they
are mind states.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.790
So if we're looking
at our states of mind,

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:29.380
and then looking
at the possibility

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.060
to transform those
states of mind,

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.620
then that becomes very fruitful.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.800
And then, of course, the
problem starts up again,

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.100
because we start meditating
looking for happiness.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.010
So we're busy meditating,
and then, again,

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.754
trying to get something,
trying to feel something.

00:07:48.754 --> 00:07:50.420
And this is the
struggle for many people

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.920
in meditation, is
they say, it's not

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.040
working because I
don't feel anything.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.320
I've been at this for this long.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.270
When am I going to get high?

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:01.050
Where's the buzz?

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.360
So we want the feeling
because we're very conditions

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.980
to feel something.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.130
We're in this culture
of looking for a high.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:12.510
And then we meditate and
look for the same thing.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:16.920
The cycle starts again
of wanting, not getting,

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.540
feeling it's not enough.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.970
So I think maybe
we could redefine

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:24.020
our notion of happiness here.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:27.300
And instead of looking for some
kind of feeling or sensation--

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.480
which is very temporary,
it comes and it goes--

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:35.520
instead of that, maybe we
could discover a kind of peace

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.230
within ourselves where
everything is OK.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.570
Whether things are going
well or not going well,

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.200
everything can be OK.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.920
Because true happiness
is a state of freedom

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.814
where our mind can
feel calm and positive.

00:08:52.814 --> 00:08:54.980
And when I say calm, I'm
not talking about some kind

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.170
of tranquilized state.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:00.930
Often when people hear about
meditation and mindfulness,

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.140
they think, OK, this is
about calming the mind.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.650
So I'm going to really
bring my stress down.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.990
I'm really going to calm down.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.000
And then what
happens to people is

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.370
they think meditation means
you're supposed to get rid

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.230
of all of your thoughts.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.220
So they have this idea
that the calm state is

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.010
an empty state, a blank state.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:26.780
Calming the mind means stilling
everything, stilling the mind.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.850
And that again becomes
a problem because we're

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:33.800
struggling to blank out
our thoughts and emotions.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.320
And we think of meditation
a bit like going to sleep

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.780
or going into a coma,
just going under.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.430
It's not about going to sleep.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:42.840
It's about waking up.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.020
It's about being present,
being conscious, being aware.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:49.740
So then the thoughts and
feelings and distractions

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.870
are actually part of
the whole journey.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.940
It's all about how
you deal with those.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.120
It's not about calming them down
so there's nothing happening.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.070
It's about being
the observer, taking

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:04.250
the place of the observer, the
one who is aware of the mind.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:07.860
And the observer is happy.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.710
The observer is free.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.250
Let's think about it this way.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.820
When you're experiencing
unhappiness,

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:18.180
when you're
experiencing sadness,

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.480
there's a part of you
that knows you're unhappy.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.420
And when you meditate,
you become more identified

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:28.170
with that part that knows
what the mind is doing.

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:32.290
And that part is not
in the unhappiness.

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.950
That part is able to see it.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.140
So that awareness is free.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.300
And the more we can
build our awareness,

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.530
the more freedom we can develop.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.850
So I think it's important
to stop seeing meditation

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:49.330
and mindfulness as a way
of just getting rid of

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.710
or removing everything,
but instead,

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:55.400
a way of becoming the
observer of the mind.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.380
And this is how we
choose happiness.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.880
Because when we can
be the observer,

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.600
we can start to make choices.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.020
Let's look at what happens
to somebody in a meditation

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.970
session.

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:10.010
They are observing
their breathing.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:14.110
That's a very common technique--
focusing on your breathing.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.860
And then, of course,
within a few seconds,

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.650
the mind starts wandering.

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.660
And then the person starts
punishing themselves

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.890
and saying, I'm a
failure, I can't do this.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.950
That's not right.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.230
So instead of feeling
like a failure

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.830
because our mind
wandered, the other option

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:34.220
would be to simply notice
that the mind wandered

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:37.870
and then return to
the breath, gently

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:41.470
and compassionately
returning to the breath.

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:44.920
This is actually the
meaning of compassion,

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.750
is that you're not
beating yourself up

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.730
for what your mind is doing.

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:51.150
And also, you're not trying
to chase those thoughts

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.150
and make them different.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.650
You're just letting
them be how they are.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:56.870
That's unconditional love.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.520
You have a thought or a feeling.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.987
It's OK the way it is.

00:11:59.987 --> 00:12:01.320
You don't need to get rid of it.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.590
You don't need more of it.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.120
It's just fine.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.560
That's compassion.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.960
It's fine the way it is.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.440
And then you return to the
breath, and you carry on,

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.540
and then the mind goes again.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.030
The mind escapes again.

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:19.200
The mind floats
off into thoughts,

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.850
and you bring it back.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:23.970
And this bringing it
back again and again--

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:27.790
that's how we're
exercising choice.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:32.920
Because it was choiceless
that our mind got distracted.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:38.030
And now we're turning around and
bringing it back to the breath.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:39.700
We're making that choice.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.820
I'm coming back here.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.100
So through meditation
training, we're

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.380
strengthening that
power of choice.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.050
And then as we
meditate every day,

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.090
regularly, just like
going to the gym,

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:55.080
lifting weights, exercise,
we're exercising our mind.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.990
And this is making us stronger.

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:01.760
So then we can find
that in our life,

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:08.000
we can become more able to
choose to stay positive.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.060
Instead of being
automatically dragged

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:15.470
into negative reactivity,
which is our normal habit,

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:20.790
we can choose to stay calm and
stay present, stay focused,

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.957
stay positive.

00:13:22.957 --> 00:13:24.540
And what we're doing
is we're choosing

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:32.150
a happiness that is beyond
triggers and supports and need.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:33.815
It's simply an internal
state of being.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.831
So when we hear this term inner
peace, it sounds very weak,

00:13:40.831 --> 00:13:41.330
doesn't it?

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.760
Inner peace, like
nothing is happening.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.620
But I think it
means to be at peace

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:53.300
with your experiences, negative
ones as well as positive ones.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.702
So say you're
sitting in the car.

00:13:55.702 --> 00:14:00.340
A favorite practice of mine is
to practice mindfulness moments

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:03.280
when I'm stuck in traffic
or when I'm standing

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.270
in a queue at an airport.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:10.120
So these are situations that
normally make us feel wound up,

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.340
irritated, impatient, et cetera.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.070
So you're choosing
instead to just

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.336
be aware of your body
and your breathing.

00:14:17.336 --> 00:14:18.460
You're sitting in that car.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.230
You're stuck in traffic.

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:24.610
Your mind is running into
the impatience or anger,

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:28.750
and you just pull it back and
go into a sense of presence--

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.910
feeling the ground
under your feet,

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:32.590
feeling the chair
under your body,

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:36.150
being aware of your
shoulders, your breathing.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.750
You're in that mindful state.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:42.100
What you've done
in that moment is

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:46.290
you've reprogrammed yourself.

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.410
Because we normally have
this automatic programming

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:53.130
of when I'm in a stressful
situation, such as waiting

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.020
for something, I must
react negatively.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.600
It's not even intellectualized.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.260
It's very much
part of our habit,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:02.970
our habitual way of reacting.

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.550
So instead, we're
changing that and learning

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:09.000
to just be still and be
calm and be in this moment

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.730
without judging this moment.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:14.800
So we're reprogramming
ourselves.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.070
We're, in a way,
rewiring ourself.

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:24.330
Instead of having this stressful
situation and negative reaction

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:28.700
fused together, we have
a stressful situation

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:34.560
and a relaxed response,
creating a new connection.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.160
In terms of our brain, we're
building new neural pathways.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.620
And these become stronger
and stronger and stronger.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:44.860
And also, we're
learning happiness.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:48.109
Because next time
you're stuck in traffic,

00:15:48.109 --> 00:15:49.150
you can think, oh, great.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:53.650
Now I can do that thing that
I learned from that monk.

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:54.592
So you feel joy.

00:15:54.592 --> 00:15:55.300
You think, great.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:55.821
Bring it on.

00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:56.320
Traffic.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:56.819
Come on.

00:15:56.819 --> 00:15:58.185
Let's do more.

00:15:58.185 --> 00:16:00.310
It's like going to the gym
and loading more weights

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:01.560
on the weight-lifting machine.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.100
You get bigger muscles.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.640
So life's struggles
and difficulties

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:12.540
become chances or
opportunities for awakening.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.850
So then you're almost
looking forward to that.

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:17.850
I don't mean you're becoming
some kind of masochist who just

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:19.110
wants everything to go wrong.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:23.074
I just mean that you're taking
experiences as they come.

00:16:23.074 --> 00:16:24.990
And when you're stuck
in traffic, you feel OK.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:26.220
You feel, in a way, good.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.800
You want this to happen
because it gives you

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.420
a chance for training.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.120
And then that shifts
into your relationships.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.280
Because let's face it--
relationships are the main

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.460
provokers of stress
in our life--

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:43.220
how people behave, how we
behave, all of that stuff.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.160
So that becomes your
traffic experience.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.920
You're with somebody who
you feel uncomfortable,

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.550
and that's your traffic
training, because you're

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:58.600
learning to meet the obstacle
with a relaxed mind, which

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.310
doesn't mean you've become
passive or like a doormat,

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:03.570
letting people abuse you.

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:05.253
It doesn't mean that.

00:17:05.253 --> 00:17:08.430
It simply means you
don't get wound up.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:10.869
And it means you can
actually, in a way,

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:14.160
experience compassion
towards that person.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.280
Because in the same way as
when you're stuck in traffic

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.640
and you felt somehow
good about the traffic,

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.160
because this is your
chance for training,

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.230
you now feel that this
person is your friend.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.940
They're presenting you with
an opportunity for training.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.140
So your heart opens to them.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.830
And that's compassion.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.110
You see, for many people,
compassion is very partial.

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:40.330
It's just an
emotional experience

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:43.780
that is triggered when you
see small, fluffy animals

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.300
and children, or the vulnerable.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.210
And of course, that's a
very, very crucial area

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:49.910
of compassion.

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:51.285
We see people who
are vulnerable.

00:17:51.285 --> 00:17:52.750
We feel compassion.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.780
But that's very partial just
in that moment, at that time,

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.900
and it's just an experience
of an emotional reaction that

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.140
comes and goes.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.640
Whereas what I'm
talking about here,

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.370
through meditation
training, is where

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:09.180
you're building the networks
of compassion in your behavior.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:13.160
In your brain, in your behavior,
you're building those networks.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.750
Because every time
somebody does something

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:20.090
or says something that
makes you uncomfortable,

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:21.210
you don't have to take it.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:22.690
You don't have to be a victim.

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:27.690
But how you feel internally is
the crucial thing, isn't it?

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:33.770
And if you can see this person
as your compassion tester,

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:37.280
your opportunity, then
your energy changes,

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.170
and the relationship changes.

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:44.340
So you're choosing happiness
even in difficult situations.

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:49.320
Because I think if happiness
is only in certain situations

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:53.740
when things are going well,
then it's very partial.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:57.630
But if you're choosing to be
happy, even against the odds,

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:00.315
then you're really in
charge of your life.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.250
But of course, we
have to train in this.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:08.670
This is work.

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:10.020
This is work.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:10.830
We need to train.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:15.870
We need to put effort
into daily meditation.

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.480
And I think many people find
that difficult because they're

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.660
so busy, and meditation is
the last thing on the list,

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.826
and then we're too tired,
all of those things.

00:19:24.826 --> 00:19:26.700
But I think, actually,
the main reason people

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:31.620
struggle to meditate every
day is because of grasping.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.780
It's because of a sense
of hidden grasping,

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:37.980
a hidden agenda, which is I
want the meditation to make

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.984
me feel good.

00:19:39.984 --> 00:19:42.130
It's a hidden agenda.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:43.280
It's got to feel nice.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.750
And if it doesn't feel
nice, it's not worth doing.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.680
And then, of course,
that doesn't happen,

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.205
so then we don't
want to meditate.

00:19:49.205 --> 00:19:50.980
We want to do other stuff.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:52.930
We don't drink five
coffees in a row

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:56.090
because that makes us
feel better, or whatever.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.990
We want things.

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.680
We want people.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.780
We want situations.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.380
That's feeding us
very instantly.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:03.920
The meditation doesn't
give us an instant hit.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.650
So it becomes much harder to
stay committed to something

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:08.862
that's not giving you a hit.

00:20:08.862 --> 00:20:11.570
It's really hard.

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:15.650
So I think the solution
is to do two things.

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:19.720
One is to learn how to practice
tiny moments of meditation

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.114
throughout the day.

00:20:21.114 --> 00:20:22.780
I'm not saying that
will give you a hit,

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.710
but I'm just saying it's easy to
just drop into a mindful state

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:29.170
while you're washing your
hands, or brushing your teeth,

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:32.650
or stuck in traffic,
because it's just a moment.

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:34.060
You're not requiring time.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.280
You're just momentarily
going into that state

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.380
throughout the day.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:41.330
And what happens to you
is you start to notice

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.207
that this is quite pleasurable.

00:20:43.207 --> 00:20:44.540
You're not looking for pleasure.

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.970
You're not looking
for a feeling.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.220
But as the mindfulness builds
up throughout your day,

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:53.960
you start to feel good, because
you start to feel at peace,

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.520
and you start to feel nourished.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:01.750
It brings an enormous amount
of nourishment into your being

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.750
because you're being
present, you're being calm,

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:06.540
you're not going with
negative reactivity.

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.550
This is really enriching.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:13.810
And this gets you
wanting to meditate more.

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:15.220
So that's one thing.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.670
Another thing which
really helps if you

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:20.130
find it hard to
meditate regularly

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:23.880
is to occasionally develop
some kind of wisdom

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.550
about the process
of meditation, which

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:29.880
means to spend time thinking
about why meditation

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.859
is important.

00:21:31.859 --> 00:21:34.150
And the best way to do this
is to actually ask yourself

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:38.790
simple questions, such as where
does happiness really come

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:41.150
from.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:44.720
Where does happiness
really come from?

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.560
And where does suffering
really come from?

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.610
They come from the mind.

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:53.700
They are mind states.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:57.300
And what happens if I
change my mind state?

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:00.020
What happens if I train my mind?

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:02.870
How does this address
the deep question

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:05.310
of happiness and suffering?

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:09.140
So if you ask yourself that,
it helps you to remember that

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:13.850
actually, in life, all we
want is happiness and freedom

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:17.930
from pain, and all the things
we're doing to get that

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:21.140
are only working to
a certain degree.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:25.160
But if happiness and freedom
from pain are mind states,

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:30.630
then surely, training our mind
is the way to get what we want.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:34.130
So when you realize that
meditation will actually

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:36.930
give you what you wanted
from all those other things

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.839
but weren't getting
in the long run,

00:22:39.839 --> 00:22:41.380
when you realize
it's a long journey,

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.170
but it will give
you what you wanted,

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:44.507
then you want to meditate.

00:22:44.507 --> 00:22:45.965
This gives you
energy for practice.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:51.580
So I think I've covered
a few points here.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.860
I've been talking
about happiness

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:57.550
and the choice of choosing
happiness, learning

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:00.310
where happiness comes from,
and the link with meditation

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:01.504
practice.

00:23:01.504 --> 00:23:02.920
And I think a
really crucial thing

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:08.590
to take away from this is that
meditation requires letting go

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:11.210
rather than grasping.

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:14.045
We tend to live in such
a grasping culture.

00:23:14.045 --> 00:23:16.780
We're always wanting something.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.060
And then when we
meditate, it's really hard

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:21.260
not to grasp after results.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:24.340
But I it's really important
just to have some time when

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:27.220
we totally let go and
just experience our mind,

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.180
whether it's busy or not busy.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:32.569
There's no such thing as good
meditation or bad meditation.

00:23:32.569 --> 00:23:34.360
Some people have a
session where their mind

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.785
is just crazy, crazy, just
rolling around like a--

00:23:37.785 --> 00:23:40.030
I don't know-- like
a spinning top,

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:41.770
and they feel it
was a bad session.

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.830
To me, that's a good
session, because you

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:48.760
saw your mind in all its glory.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:52.290
You're experiencing
the busy mind.

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:53.265
That's a good session.

00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:53.765
That's work.

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.110
That's a good workout.

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:02.200
So maybe we need to move
away from this judgment

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.220
around what a good session
and a bad session is.

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:09.350
And I think then we can
experience more freedom

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:12.830
and greater compassion.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.770
So I want to stop there
and now open this up

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:17.570
to questions and discussion.

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:20.510
So [INAUDIBLE] is
going to lead that.

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:23.700
SPEAKER: I think I've known you
a little more than a year now.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:24.730
And every time--

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:28.280
I think last year [INAUDIBLE]
six weeks of coming to Google

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.910
and giving such talks.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:33.320
And I still find myself
learning new things when you

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.102
speak about the same subjects.

00:24:35.102 --> 00:24:36.060
GELONG THUBTEN: Me too.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:39.005
Every time I speak,
I learn something.

00:24:39.005 --> 00:24:41.220
SPEAKER: OK So I have
a lot of questions,

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.440
but there's a lot of
people in the room.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.775
So I want to make
sure I give time to--

00:24:45.775 --> 00:24:48.750
well, not everyone, but a lot
of people to ask questions.

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.510
But I'll just start
with a few questions

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:54.620
and then open it
up to the floor.

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.920
And I want to start with
a bit more, I guess,

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:03.230
personal about your choice when
you decided to leave acting

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:06.470
and become a monk.

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:08.120
At what period of
your life, and how

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.180
did you come to that
decision, in case

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:12.620
there's someone in the room
looking to make the switch?

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.900
GELONG THUBTEN: Oh, yeah OK.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:18.470
So I was 21, which
is 25 years ago.

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:20.180
And I was living in New York.

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.700
And I was incredibly stressed.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:25.970
I really was burning
out with stress.

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:33.380
And I needed something to really
get my emotional and physical

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.509
health back on track.

00:25:35.509 --> 00:25:37.800
And a friend of mine told me
about a Buddhist monastery

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.440
called Samye Ling in Scotland.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.720
It's the oldest Tibetan
Buddhist monastery in the West.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.840
It was started in the 1960s.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.970
And she told me about
this place and said,

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:50.830
you could go there and
be a monk for a year

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:54.740
to sort yourself out.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:58.790
And I went there, and I became
a monk after three days.

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:01.856
And it was only for
a year, first of all.

00:26:01.856 --> 00:26:03.230
I wasn't planning
to stay longer.

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:05.300
But slowly, over time,
during that year,

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:10.190
I started to study Buddhist
philosophy and meditation.

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:13.310
And also, through
studying these teachings,

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:15.560
my attitude about life
started to change.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:19.440
I started to think, what
do I want in my life?

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.430
Do I want to live a
life maybe more that's

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:25.100
down the avenue of
service, serving others?

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.770
And I started to
see how being a monk

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:31.070
could help me to not only
help myself, but help others.

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:33.020
And so I decided to stay.

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:38.900
And I eventually became a
fully ordained life monk.

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:43.190
But the initial motive, I think,
was just feeling really crazy

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:44.780
and needing some peace.

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:48.590
And then it changed into a
sense of a journey and a path

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:52.390
which I'm learning and trying
to help others to learn.

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:53.280
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.120
At the beginning of
a journey, I suppose,

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.960
in a lot of people
that start meditating,

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.700
your probably face
some challenges

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:00.990
and some difficulties.

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:04.380
And I know you've
probably meditated way--

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.440
a lot more than a lot
of people in the room.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:09.840
So I guess just to relate
to your experience,

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.810
your challenges when you
first started to meditate,

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:15.220
and a lot of the
difficulties you faced,

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.140
what are some of them
that you can share?

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.640
GELONG THUBTEN:
Well, the first time

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.820
I meditated, it was
really into the deep end.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.850
We had to do two
hours without moving.

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:27.926
And I just remember sitting
there with my legs on fire.

00:27:27.926 --> 00:27:29.550
I had to sit cross-legged
on the floor.

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:31.614
My legs and my back on fire.

00:27:31.614 --> 00:27:33.780
And there was a carpet in
front of me with patterns,

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:35.238
and I was looking
at these patterns

00:27:35.238 --> 00:27:38.940
to just try and stay alive.

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:42.010
Just focus on that pattern,
and you won't go crazy.

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:43.710
So that was extreme.

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:48.360
And then, of course, I learned
how to build it up slowly

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.390
and do smaller sessions.

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:54.000
But one of the challenges
I found earlier on,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.100
which I addressed
in this talk, is

00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:02.000
that I really was searching
for a feeling all the time.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.220
And there was a period where I
was doing a lot of meditation

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:10.940
and getting very depressed
and feeling very--

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:11.930
almost like let down.

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:14.330
It was a heavy feeling.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:18.120
And I spoke to my teacher,
[INAUDIBLE] Rinpoche, and he--

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:22.460
I told him about this,
and he said, actually,

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:24.130
you're like somebody
who's taking drugs.

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:25.847
You're using the
meditation like a drug.

00:28:25.847 --> 00:28:26.930
You're trying to get high.

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:28.554
And I realized that's
what I was doing.

00:28:28.554 --> 00:28:31.160
I was sitting down
to try and ramp up

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.914
some sensation in
my mind or my body.

00:28:33.914 --> 00:28:36.080
And of course, because
you're looking for something,

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.540
you're feeling the lack of that.

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:43.100
And so he showed me how to work
through that, and instead--

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.190
there really has to be a
motivation of compassion.

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:48.770
Even if you're just meditating
for stress reduction,

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:49.800
that's not enough.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.640
There's got to be a feeling
that this is not just

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.290
about me, but about others.

00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:56.000
And you're dedicating
your practice

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.880
to the happiness of all,
the happiness of others.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:03.810
And then this removes
the grasping--

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:05.510
not all of it, but some of it--

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:08.640
and also gives a
sense of a journey.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.730
SPEAKER: And at this stage
for you, do you still

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:14.010
find it hard to let
go of the grasping

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:15.840
and always have the
right intention?

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.340
Do you still struggle?

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:19.131
GELONG THUBTEN: Of
course I still struggle.

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.270
This whole idea of having
the right intention that--

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:27.240
in Buddhism, we talk about
having the motivation to free

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.490
all beings from
suffering, and this

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:32.490
needs to be your
motivation for practice.

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:35.310
So I could really give
myself a hard time about that

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:36.750
and say, well,
that's not genuine.

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:39.720
I'm not experiencing that
much, and my motivation

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.540
is not good enough.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:44.700
But I actually think wanting
to have good motivation

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.105
is good motivation.

00:29:46.105 --> 00:29:48.840
It's almost like wanting to
be more compassionate means

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.640
you already are compassionate.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:54.330
And that's the way I relax
myself about this stuff.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:55.830
When I'm struggling
with this stuff,

00:29:55.830 --> 00:30:00.110
I say, actually, I'm
doing my best, so it's OK.

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:03.150
I'm much gentler on
myself than I used to be.

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:06.325
That's changed a lot
through meditation.

00:30:06.325 --> 00:30:08.700
SPEAKER: I suppose it's a
common challenge for a lot when

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.250
you beat yourself with
a stick when it wasn't

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:12.567
a good meditation session.

00:30:12.567 --> 00:30:14.150
GELONG THUBTEN: It
wasn't good enough.

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:15.110
It wasn't authentic.

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.990
It wasn't this.

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.640
It wasn't that.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.260
That's just another judgment.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:21.080
That's another
thing to let go of.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.470
SPEAKER: And-- along
those lines of what's good

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:26.960
and what's bad-- so a
lot of people sometimes,

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.110
me included, when you're
feeling good, then OK,

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:33.689
and whatever is around
you is benefiting you.

00:30:33.689 --> 00:30:35.105
To meditate, you
sit and meditate.

00:30:35.105 --> 00:30:36.770
But when you're sick,
when you're ill,

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:39.040
when you don't feel
good, you're like, no, I

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:40.580
don't need meditation now.

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:43.220
Or vise versa-- sometimes
people really only

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:44.590
meditate when they're stressed.

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:46.423
And when they're really
happy, they're like,

00:30:46.423 --> 00:30:49.220
I don't need medication
because I'm already happy.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.772
GELONG THUBTEN: The first one
is more common, which is--

00:30:52.772 --> 00:30:54.980
both are true, and the first
one is even more common,

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:58.250
which is where, if you're tired,
you're sick, you're unhappy,

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:00.110
you think, oh, I'll
meditate later.

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:03.860
I'm not in the right state
for it to be a good session.

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:08.480
And this is really a
deceptive motivation.

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.820
Because what happens then
is you're telling yourself,

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:14.690
I have to feel a certain way
for my meditation to work.

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:18.300
I can only meditate when I
feel like it, when I feel good.

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.400
And that's not meditation.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.630
Then it's again back
to that grasping.

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:25.310
So I think it's really important
to meditate when you're tired,

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:27.590
when you're sick,
when you're unhappy.

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:30.230
Because you're just being
with that experience

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:32.120
in an unconditional way.

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.970
And that is how you make
friends with yourself,

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:37.312
all aspects of yourself.

00:31:37.312 --> 00:31:39.770
Otherwise, you're just showing
up at the meditation cushion

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:40.890
when you're in a good mood.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:43.014
It's like you're having a
very partial relationship

00:31:43.014 --> 00:31:45.560
with yourself, like a
fair-weather friend.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.184
When I'm in a good mood,
then I'll sit with my mind.

00:31:48.184 --> 00:31:49.850
But when my mind is
not in a good state,

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:51.330
I'm going to reject it.

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:55.120
So instead, if you meditate
when you're unwell,

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.850
you're making friends with your
experience in a very genuine,

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:00.892
compassionate way.

00:32:00.892 --> 00:32:02.600
SPEAKER: Does anybody
have any questions,

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.050
or should I keep going?

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:09.590
AUDIENCE: So you were
speaking about the experience

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:11.690
of being stuck in traffic.

00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:15.100
So I wonder if any
of the techniques

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:19.130
may be applied to the situation
where you are actually driving.

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:23.180
So I wonder whether
being mindful

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:26.540
may get in the way of doing
some important work that

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:29.260
requires being focused
on something external.

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:31.820
GELONG THUBTEN: Well,
actually, just to drive a car,

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:34.230
you are being mindful.

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:37.310
Everyone has a natural
kind of mindfulness.

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:39.500
To drive a car, you
have to be mindful.

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.790
Otherwise, your car
is going to crash.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:45.710
So there is already a
level of mindfulness there.

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:49.280
And I think it's important
to see mindfulness

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.890
as you're being really present.

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:53.120
You're not switched off.

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:56.150
Some people like to close
their eyes and go within.

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:57.960
That's not what
I'm talking about.

00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:00.355
I'm talking about being
totally in this moment.

00:33:00.355 --> 00:33:01.730
So when you're
driving a car, you

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:03.797
have to be totally
in this moment.

00:33:03.797 --> 00:33:05.630
But what many people
do is they drive a car,

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:08.219
and they are partially
mindful of what's going on.

00:33:08.219 --> 00:33:10.760
And then they're listening to
music and chatting to a friend,

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.440
and there's very
split attention.

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.860
But you could drive
completely mindfully,

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.547
and that could be meditation.

00:33:20.687 --> 00:33:21.770
AUDIENCE: So I basically--

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:24.990
I have two comments, and I was
hoping you can reflect on it.

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:28.380
So the first
comment is why isn't

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:31.260
being more aware and a state
of freedom the default.

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:33.420
Why is it such a
challenge for us?

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:39.600
And secondly, I was wondering,
are we not actually choosing--

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.220
not per se happiness,
but to be more

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:45.490
in control of the
different states of being?

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:47.760
So it's more like a
control issue, almost.

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:50.010
If you have more awareness
of all the states of being,

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:51.570
then you feel in control.

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:55.890
You're not as much into either
being happy or suffering.

00:33:55.890 --> 00:34:00.760
So basically, the two comments
are why it's not the default

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:05.640
and why it's not more
about building awareness

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:08.159
to feel more in control.

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:09.659
GELONG THUBTEN:
Well, in a way, when

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:14.370
you say happiness and
freedom and default,

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:16.469
in the Buddhist
understanding, we

00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:20.040
believe that our
natural mind is pure.

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:24.929
Our deeper mind is free.

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:28.710
We call it Buddha nature, which
is that deep down inside, we

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:31.139
have the potential
for awakening.

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:34.260
And in fact, every time you sit
down on a chair or a cushion

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:37.260
to meditate, you're
acknowledging that potential.

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:39.150
Because why would
you do something

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:41.550
unless you felt you
had the potential

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:43.330
to achieve the results of it?

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:46.420
So you're meditating because you
know there's something deeper.

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:51.239
So in a way, our natural state
is happy and pure and free.

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:53.790
But it's layered with confusion.

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:55.320
We get caught up in confusion.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.820
We get addicted to confusion.

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:59.730
And a lot of that is
to do with survival--

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:03.470
the survival instinct, the
fight or flight reaction.

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:07.980
In a way, our brain is wired
to obsess about what's wrong

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:11.650
and what's dangerous, because
that's how we stay alive.

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:14.850
But much deeper than that
is pure consciousness

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:18.360
that we can learn to slowly
access through meditation.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.950
And then the second
comment around--

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:21.290
actually, I've forgotten
your second comment.

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:22.240
It was really intense.

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.020
So can you repeat it?

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:29.620
AUDIENCE: So are we not
choosing to be more aware?

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:30.870
GELONG THUBTEN: In meditation?

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:32.340
AUDIENCE: Yeah, in meditation.

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:34.500
Instead of-- OK, we're
not choosing happiness,

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.360
but it's more like
we're choosing

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:39.960
to be more aware of our
different states of beings.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.300
Thereby, we build
up more control of--

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.540
either we are in this happy
mode or this suffering mode,

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:47.410
yes or no?

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:49.790
Basically, our
capability to zoom out

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:51.870
is built by the meditation.

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:54.167
GELONG THUBTEN: I don't
know about control.

00:35:54.167 --> 00:35:56.250
I don't know if we're
controlling our mind states.

00:35:56.250 --> 00:36:00.720
I think it's that we're
learning to let go.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.940
So it's a bit like
traffic on a road.

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:05.430
You have cars going by.

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:07.800
Are you getting into the
cars and going for drives,

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.690
or are you just
letting the cars go by?

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:10.920
And then maybe you
could choose to get

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.390
into the useful
cars, the cars that

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:14.280
take you somewhere positive.

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.230
So it's about making choice.

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:19.860
I find the term "control" makes
me think of something very

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.230
tight and rigid and repressive.

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:24.990
I'm talking about
freedom and choice.

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:26.440
Does that make sense?

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:26.940
Cool.

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:27.700
Thank you.

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:34.230
AUDIENCE: Do you
think that you're

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:36.990
more free if you control
your own mind or more free

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:39.240
if the mind controls you?

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:42.090
GELONG THUBTEN: Well, let's
dump this word "control."

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:47.700
I think you can be
more free if you can

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:51.300
choose what your mind is doing.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.800
Do you understand
why I'm slightly

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.660
hesitant about the
term "control?"

00:36:55.660 --> 00:37:01.420
Because it sounds like you're
making your mind very tense,

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:03.640
controlling what it
does, pushing down

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.876
the negative
thoughts and jumping

00:37:05.876 --> 00:37:07.000
into the positive thoughts.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.310
That, to me, feels
very stressful.

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:11.140
Yeah?

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:16.810
So can we rephrase this and
think more in terms of freedom?

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:18.700
And your question
was are you choosing

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:19.970
or is the mind choosing you.

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:22.550
And like I started
my talk today,

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:25.990
it really feels like
stuff chooses us.

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:28.870
Suddenly, we're experiencing
sadness, and we're thinking,

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:29.800
I didn't ask for this.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.640
Where did this come from?

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.640
And then we think
somebody put it in us.

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.860
We immediately point the finger.

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:37.825
Oh, it must be you.

00:37:37.825 --> 00:37:38.950
Why am I feeling like this?

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:41.530
It must be you, or
it must be this.

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:45.280
And so it feels like these mind
states are invading or choosing

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.800
us, and sticking
to us like glue.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.710
And I think meditation is about
changing it round so that you

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:52.960
are the one who is creating.

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:56.370
You are creating your
thoughts and emotions,

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:58.810
and you are learning how
to create the right ones

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:01.870
and just let go of the
ones that harm you.

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:02.450
Thank you.

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.950
AUDIENCE: So I actually
also have two questions.

00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:10.960
For one, it's mindfulness--

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.610
we want to be present
in this moment.

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:15.945
But I guess a lot of people here
have days that we plan ahead.

00:38:15.945 --> 00:38:17.590
We plan our next day.

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:19.820
We plan our next week, our year.

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:24.100
So how do you
suggest we do this?

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:27.580
How do we plan, but
we still stay mindful?

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:30.400
GELONG THUBTEN: So yeah,
we do need to plan.

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:34.180
And it often sounds like
a contradiction when

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:37.380
we say mindfulness is about
being in the present moment,

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:39.575
and then, we've
got to plan stuff.

00:38:39.575 --> 00:38:41.950
Are we supposed to just live
in the present all the time?

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:44.830
If you lived in the present
all the time, you wouldn't eat.

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:46.870
You wouldn't plan--
you know what I mean?

00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:48.130
You're planning your meal.

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:50.560
So again, it's to
do with choice.

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.420
I think we plan obsessively.

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:53.620
We plan impulsively.

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:59.590
We plan in a way that becomes
so habitual that we never

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:01.180
actually arrive.

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.280
Because when we get to
the thing we planned,

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.260
we're busy planning
the next thing.

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:07.660
So how about
planning the choice?

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:09.700
How about choosing
to plan, as and when

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:12.430
you need to plan,
and then let go?

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:15.904
Make plans, do what you need
to do, but let go of outcomes.

00:39:15.904 --> 00:39:17.320
That would be a
much healthier way

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.900
of making our plans
actually succeed.

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:22.384
What was your second question?

00:39:22.384 --> 00:39:23.800
AUDIENCE: So with
this, you really

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.440
say that we just let
go of the outcome,

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.764
like we don't judge it anymore.

00:39:27.764 --> 00:39:29.680
GELONG THUBTEN: I think
that's important, even

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.790
in worldly success.

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:32.532
If you want to be
successful at work,

00:39:32.532 --> 00:39:33.615
you've got to make a plan.

00:39:33.615 --> 00:39:35.770
You've got to do what it
takes to get there and let

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:37.330
go of outcomes.

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:41.110
Because otherwise, you're
so actually fearful

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:43.600
that the outcome won't
happen that it won't happen,

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:47.450
because you've created a sense
of lack already in your mind.

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:50.240
AUDIENCE: The second one
was more about emotions.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:54.100
So we have this thought
that we actually

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:56.390
need to let out our emotions.

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:57.730
So if I feel sad--

00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:00.520
I don't know-- I need
to cry to let it out.

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.620
So would you really
say we need to do this?

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:07.370
Because this state of
being aware of the feeling,

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:13.270
I feel like we make suppressive.

00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:17.370
GELONG THUBTEN: So when we feel
we need to let out our emotion,

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:20.980
it's because we see our emotion
as something very solid,

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:23.195
and we need to somehow eject it.

00:40:23.195 --> 00:40:24.070
You know what I mean?

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:26.320
We have to get it out,
because otherwise it's

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.330
going to poison us.

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:29.500
It's so solid, and we have to--

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:31.360
almost like vomiting.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.960
You know what I mean?

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:36.437
And so with
meditation, you start

00:40:36.437 --> 00:40:38.770
to understand the mind in a
very different way, which is

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:41.267
that your emotions aren't real.

00:40:41.267 --> 00:40:42.350
Your emotions aren't real.

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:45.020
They can come and go like
clouds in the sky or waves

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:46.200
in the ocean.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.690
So you don't need
to suppress them.

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:51.220
You don't need to get them out.

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.560
You can just experience
them and let them go.

00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:59.080
So this is the
training of meditation

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.210
which will help us to
understand our mind

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:04.030
or experience our
mind more in that way.

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:07.360
And then this whole notion
of suppression or expression

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.820
starts to change.

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:11.980
You find that you can
just be with the emotion

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.970
and not be too bothered by it.

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:17.440
AUDIENCE: I have one
interconnected question

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.580
with you, maybe.

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:24.520
So I do meditate, and
I'm far away from--

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.710
well, doing it the ideal way.

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:27.580
It's a journey.

00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:29.320
I understood it's a journey.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:33.070
But I try to think of ways to
bring this to other people,

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:38.410
to encourage other people,
or to hold my own meditation

00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:40.960
session, maybe, one day.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.000
Would you have any
advice what to do,

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.950
or maybe what not
to do, in order

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:48.640
to really encourage people
who may be connected to that?

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:53.940
How would you-- it's maybe
a difficult question to ask.

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:56.370
But I think many people
connect meditation

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:59.550
to spirituality or
religion, and they

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:02.450
might be disconnected from
religion and spirituality

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:04.600
on an intellectual level.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.320
So this might-- although it
is so accessible-- you just

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.600
need to sit down-- it might
be difficult for people

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.340
to get over that barrier.

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:15.749
Maybe you have any advice on
how to encourage that more?

00:42:15.749 --> 00:42:16.540
GELONG THUBTEN: OK.

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:20.470
So the first question
around teaching others--

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:23.230
of course, it's really
important to let

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:27.100
one's own practice mature
before one teaches others--

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.810
mature to a certain
degree, at least,

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:32.290
and also to have good
instruction and guidance

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:35.800
from teachers so that you
really are transmitting it

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.040
in the correct way.

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:40.600
I think that's really,
really important.

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:43.060
There are obviously
different levels of teacher.

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:45.380
I'm just an ordinary instructor.

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:48.100
I'm not an enlightened
person who can give lessons

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.480
and all that kind of stuff.

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.190
I'm just an ordinary instructor.

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:53.090
But even for that,
I've had to do

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:55.090
a certain amount of
retreats, and training,

00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:58.180
and be taught properly,
and transmit according

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:01.685
to a correct procedure.

00:43:01.685 --> 00:43:03.810
So it's important to get
more training for yourself

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:05.971
before maybe passing
it on to others.

00:43:05.971 --> 00:43:08.220
But it's great to have that
motivation, because you're

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:11.730
already seeing that this
meditation journey isn't just

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:12.270
for you.

00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:14.400
It's something
you want to share.

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:17.700
Without preaching and
trying to convert people,

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.440
it's just making it available.

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.450
I think that's really good.

00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:23.460
And then sure, the second
thing you mentioned

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:27.000
is around how people
sometimes associate meditation

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.630
with religion, spirituality,
Buddhism in particular.

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:31.770
It doesn't have to be.

00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:34.290
And that's what this whole
modern movement in mindfulness

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:35.310
is about--

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:37.830
where you're using meditation
techniques in a completely

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:39.670
non-religious way.

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:44.160
And I think the neuroscience
aspect is very helpful there.

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.790
If you explain to people some
of the neuroscientific evidence

00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:51.100
for meditation's
efficiency, how it works,

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.100
that gets people to see
it on a different level.

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:55.262
It doesn't have to be
a religious experience.

00:43:55.262 --> 00:43:57.720
To me, the boundaries between
all of this are very blurred.

00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.760
Because if you sit
down and meditate,

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.419
if you're a Buddhist, if you're
a mindfulness person, if you're

00:44:02.419 --> 00:44:04.710
this or that, you're just
sitting there with your mind.

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:08.010
I don't think there's any such
thing as religious meditation.

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:09.780
Meditation is beyond religion.

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.770
It's you and your mind.

00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:13.770
So these are constructs
which I think

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:15.647
have to fall away eventually.

00:44:15.647 --> 00:44:16.480
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.799
GELONG THUBTEN: OK.

00:44:18.799 --> 00:44:19.340
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:24.810
I'm Lucas, and my question
will be very straightforward.

00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:27.050
But before I ask it,
I want to tell you

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:30.260
that I see many things
that you've been talking

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.330
about that also relate to me.

00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:34.340
Like I've been working--

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:37.930
I'm 34, and I've been working in
big corporations for the last--

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:39.720
I don't know-- 12 years.

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.880
I've been working in
sales, closing big deals,

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.770
earning good money,
getting good paychecks.

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:48.240
And those moments were
always a high for me.

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.910
GELONG THUBTEN: So
are all of you, yeah?

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:52.610
AUDIENCE: They were always
the high for me at the moment

00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:55.620
when I was really
excited and great.

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:59.150
And in the last year, I
closed the biggest deal

00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:00.850
of Google Cloud here in Dublin.

00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:04.580
And it was another moment where
I felt like, wow, I'm so great.

00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:06.890
But since, I would say,
three or four years,

00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:11.150
I've been feeling that my
mental and my physical health

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:13.190
was getting worse and worse.

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:14.780
And I've been
having things like--

00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:16.310
I was panting.

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:19.942
I was getting anxiety
attacks, panic attacks.

00:45:19.942 --> 00:45:20.900
I was going to doctors.

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:22.770
I was checking
myself, doing MRIs,

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:27.180
doing cardio tests,
everything, different doctors,

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:29.090
expecting the worst
and never getting

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:32.377
the results that would say that
something was really wrong.

00:45:32.377 --> 00:45:34.210
And I was asking myself,
what's the problem?

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:36.720
And some of the doctors
were referring to me--

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:40.670
maybe it's time for you to
focus on your mental state,

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:43.130
advising me to go
to psychiatrists

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:45.950
who deal with those situations.

00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:48.110
Because I realized, and
I'm realizing right now,

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:51.020
that when I was on the
high, then it was great,

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:53.540
but when there was a time
when I not closing those deals

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:55.880
and getting big
paychecks, I was feeling

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.010
like I was almost depressed.

00:45:58.010 --> 00:46:00.710
And maybe it's an
extreme case, but I

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:02.570
decided to leave
Google because I

00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:08.810
was just no longer able to
find my state of balance

00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:10.045
in the current situation.

00:46:10.045 --> 00:46:11.420
Like you said,
all these thoughts

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:13.370
the whole time running
through my head,

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:16.240
and just being motivated
by those things.

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.790
So I decided to leave.

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:19.530
GELONG THUBTEN:
Where you're at now

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:23.660
is to close a deal with
your own mind, isn't it?

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:26.080
You're now working
on the internal deal.

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:29.130
This whole idea of closing deals
is a relationship, isn't it?

00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:32.970
And if you can
now use meditation

00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:38.540
to connect with your mind
and have more compassion

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:40.669
for yourself and others--

00:46:40.669 --> 00:46:42.210
that's where you're
at now, isn't it?

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:43.520
It's exciting, no?

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:45.550
AUDIENCE: At the
moment, it's exciting.

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:49.350
It's a very scary moment,
because I've been like a drug

00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:50.780
addict for 12 years.

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:53.500
And now I'm trying to leave
it, and all these things

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:54.690
are coming out from me.

00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:56.231
But my question,
actually, at the end

00:46:56.231 --> 00:46:58.710
of this long introduction,
is where should I start

00:46:58.710 --> 00:47:01.770
if I would like to find maybe--

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:04.950
I don't know if I can call it a
solution, but a help in things

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:10.150
like meditation, like
becoming more aware of myself,

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:13.170
of my thoughts?

00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:14.397
How can I start this journey?

00:47:14.397 --> 00:47:15.480
GELONG THUBTEN: Start now.

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:16.800
Start now.

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:17.840
The journey starts now.

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:19.269
You just need to find a class.

00:47:19.269 --> 00:47:20.560
There's classes here in Google.

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:24.930
You can attend a class here,
and just learn some techniques,

00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:26.460
and just do it.

00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:28.410
It's very easy to
learn, in a way.

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:31.500
You just learn the method,
and then you start.

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:35.250
And really, let it be
part of your daily life--

00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:37.860
meditating every day,
but also practicing

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:39.900
moments of mindfulness
throughout the day.

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:41.970
Just start right now.

00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:43.200
Make that deal.

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.920
AUDIENCE: So you wouldn't say
there's one particular way of--

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:51.184
I don't know-- the yoga,
meditation classes?

00:47:51.184 --> 00:47:52.350
Whatever you choose is good?

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:54.042
Because you say
it's here at Google.

00:47:54.042 --> 00:47:55.750
So if I choose something
outside Google--

00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:57.350
GELONG THUBTEN:
I think breathing

00:47:57.350 --> 00:48:01.560
is a good place to start,
mindful breathing, focusing

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:02.310
on the breathing.

00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:05.040
You can learn that
technique, and that's it.

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.890
It doesn't need much
color or drama to it.

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:09.580
It's very simple.

00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:11.820
Just try it.

00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:12.570
It's exciting.

00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:13.560
Thank you.

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:14.060
Who else?

00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:18.680
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:24.600
Before you came here, I
googled you, of course,

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:26.390
to know who you were.

00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:29.180
And I found an
interesting article.

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:32.290
I just want to read it.

00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:38.120
[INAUDIBLE] It says Buddhist
monk returns to life

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:39.370
after four years in retreats.

00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:40.030
GELONG THUBTEN: Oh, yeah.

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:41.810
My past is coming
back to haunt me.

00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:44.630
AUDIENCE: I would like to
know, can you explain us

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:49.610
how was these four years in
retreat, and what you learned,

00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:52.640
and the pros and cons,
the difficulty it was,

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:54.540
and what you learned in
yourself, how it was,

00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:55.040
basically?

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.040
GELONG THUBTEN: So yeah.

00:48:56.040 --> 00:49:00.920
I was in a four-year retreat
from 2005 to 2009 on an island

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:02.750
off the coast of Scotland.

00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:06.300
And it's a really intensive
meditation training.

00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:08.510
You have no contact
with the outside world.

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:11.540
You have a letter from
your family once a month.

00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:15.110
So there's no internet,
no Google, nothing.

00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:17.030
And in fact, we
had no electricity.

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:21.170
We had a generator which came
on in the mornings and evenings.

00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:24.170
And it's a very
intensive program

00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:26.659
of meditation sessions all day.

00:49:26.659 --> 00:49:27.950
You're not doing anything else.

00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:30.470
You have tea breaks and
food, but you're just

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:34.520
doing long, long
sessions of meditation.

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:36.590
And it's really intense.

00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:38.900
And really, you learn a lot.

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:42.110
You meet your edge, and
then you meet your edge,

00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:45.020
and then you discover later
on that there's another edge

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:46.250
that you also have to meet.

00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:47.750
It never stops.

00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:51.140
And I found it
incredibly difficult,

00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:53.040
but incredibly rewarding
at the same time,

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:57.920
because it really helped
me to become more--

00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.920
kind of making
friends with myself.

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:03.410
In Buddhism, we don't
like the word "self,"

00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:05.330
but in a different way.

00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:08.090
You become more comfortable
with who you are.

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:11.290
You learn to deal with
your emotions differently.

00:50:11.290 --> 00:50:13.370
I experienced a lot of
very painful emotions

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:16.590
during that time, a lot
of sadness and depression.

00:50:16.590 --> 00:50:19.130
In fact, the first two years,
I was severely depressed.

00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:21.740
But then the meditation
started to change

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:25.610
that in that I started to
learn to have compassion

00:50:25.610 --> 00:50:27.740
for that part of my mind.

00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:31.846
And then it started
to shift and change.

00:50:31.846 --> 00:50:34.190
SPEAKER: And just jumping
in, since you mentioned

00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:35.790
for two years you
were depressed,

00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:38.840
what kept you going knowing
that, OK, you're going

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:40.250
to get over this depression?

00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:43.132
Or maybe after one
year, you said--

00:50:43.132 --> 00:50:45.590
GELONG THUBTEN: Oh, I definitely
felt like, should I leave,

00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:46.190
should I stop?

00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:48.080
I can't take this anymore.

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:49.850
I suppose what keeps
you going is there is

00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:52.010
some kind of deep commitment.

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:56.267
And you know that I really
trust the meditation

00:50:56.267 --> 00:50:57.350
journey and the teachings.

00:50:57.350 --> 00:50:59.850
There was never a point when
I thought this stuff doesn't

00:50:59.850 --> 00:51:01.100
work, or it's not good for me.

00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:02.430
I knew it's good.

00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:04.096
I just felt unable.

00:51:04.096 --> 00:51:05.470
And so that's what
kept me going.

00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:08.630
And then eventually, through
the help of my teachers

00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:10.640
and then my own
commitment, I was

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:12.170
able to connect
with the practice,

00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:13.170
and then things changed.

00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:19.140
AUDIENCE: So overall, Googlers
tend to be quite data-driven.

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:20.640
And I'm wondering
about your opinion

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.707
about actually
measuring happiness.

00:51:22.707 --> 00:51:24.540
So most of the time,
it's a scale out of 10,

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:27.589
so putting absolute numbers
to such a subjective thing.

00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:29.880
GELONG THUBTEN: I don't know
about measuring happiness,

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:32.820
because then you start
to grasp after results.

00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:37.000
Yeah, we're all data-driven.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.110
We're all in measures
and evaluations.

00:51:40.110 --> 00:51:46.230
And can we maybe take
meditation and happiness away

00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:47.880
from that world
and have some time

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:52.540
when we're just not driven,
and we can just let go and be?

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:55.825
I think that's crucial in
a data-driven environment.

00:51:55.825 --> 00:51:57.700
And that's what I've
been talking about a lot

00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:00.490
here when I'm doing these
regular classes at Google,

00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:03.250
is can we have some time when
we just switch off all of that

00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:05.320
and go into a sense of being.

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:07.010
I think that would be great.

00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:09.670
And then go back to the data,
but bringing the being with you

00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:11.970
into the data.

00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:14.545
Thank you.

00:52:14.545 --> 00:52:18.480
SPEAKER: I'll just
ask one last question

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.810
since you mentioned
data and you mentioned

00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:23.580
working with a
neuroscientist on the book.

00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:25.130
I was just wondering if you--

00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:27.590
from a science perspective,
what is the one thing

00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:31.060
you learned about meditation
from the neuroscientist that

00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:33.997
was interesting from a
scientific perspective?

00:52:33.997 --> 00:52:36.080
GELONG THUBTEN: Yeah, it's
been really interesting

00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:36.920
working with Ash.

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:37.970
He's a neuroscientist.

00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:42.030
So Ruby Wax, Ash Ranpura, and
myself did this book together,

00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:47.000
and it was an amazing
conversation about the mind

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.800
and the heart and the brain.

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:52.540
And I learned a lot
from Ash about--

00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:55.500
well, OK, so what meditation
does to your brain--

00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:58.750
there's proof that it works--
but more interestingly,

00:52:58.750 --> 00:53:01.864
this whole notion of creating
habits and changing them.

00:53:01.864 --> 00:53:03.280
He gave a really
beautiful example

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:06.280
where he said the brain
is a bit like a field,

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:10.170
a field with lots of grass.

00:53:10.170 --> 00:53:11.790
And there's no path.

00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:15.500
And one person walks
and makes a path.

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:18.000
A second person walks and
makes a path, a third person.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.250
Eventually, that path--
the grass is flattened,

00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:22.680
and there's a path, and
you can easily go down it.

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.720
And he said that's
what meditation does.

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:26.250
You're creating
neural pathways that

00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:28.380
become more and more
natural, and that's

00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:30.030
how you can be happy.

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:34.200
So I learned a lot from
Ash, and from Ruby as well.

00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:35.400
SPEAKER: Thanks for coming.

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:37.250
GELONG THUBTEN: Thank you.
