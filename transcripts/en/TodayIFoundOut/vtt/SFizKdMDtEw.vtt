00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.520
Why was Lead Added to Paint?

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:13.510
The 
use of lead in everyday objects dates back

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.690
to the ancient Romans.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.470
They used lead in makeup, as an additive in
food and wine, in pewter dinnerware, and many

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.450
other items, including paint.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.130
The inexpensive metal was even used in the
pipes that transported water throughout the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.350
Roman Empire.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.550
Lead continued to be used throughout history
and into modern day.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.140
So it was no surprise that no one thought
twice about adding lead to paint.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.850
But why did manufacturers add the heavy metal
to paint?

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.149
What purpose did it serve?

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.190
Different lead compounds are added to the
paint as a pigment, creating a specific color

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.989
depending on whichever compound is used.

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.199
For example, lead (II) carbonate, known as
white lead, makes the paint a white or cream

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.579
color and the use of lead tetroxide makes
a bright red paint.

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.629
The heavy metal additive also decreases the
amount of time that the paint takes to dry,

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.249
makes the paint more durable, and causes the
paint to be more moisture resistant.

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:09.299
This made lead-based paint ideal for use in
homes, on metal exposed to the elements, and

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.130
even childrenâ€™s toys.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.790
Of course, despite the durability of lead-based
paints, they still have that little flaw of,

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.200
well, containing lead.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.490
Exposure to the heavy metal can cause numerous
health problems.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.560
High levels of lead present in the body can
lead to convulsions, coma, and death, while

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.340
lower levels of the metal can have harmful
effects on the nervous system, brain, blood

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.630
cells, and kidneys.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.869
Infants and children are most the susceptible
to lead poisoning and may suffer from physical

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.060
and mental development, behavior problems,
and lower IQ levels.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.509
Due to all this, the U.S. government banned
the use of most leaded paints in 1978.

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.060
However, it can still be used in houses, but
the government requires that the lead content

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.430
be less than 90 parts per million.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.840
As such, today the major source of exposure
to lead paint and lead dust in the United

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.370
States continues to be homes built before
1978.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.110
Lead-based paint was popular before that time,
and thus was used in the construction of numerous

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.110
homes.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.730
The EPA does note that lead paint that appears
intact is not necessarily harmful.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.110
It can only produce dangerous lead dust if
the paint has been damaged, such as if it

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:33.680
is peeling, being rubbed, or during renovations.
