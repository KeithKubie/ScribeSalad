00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.290
Luckily for everyone, I'm a
sports engineer and not an

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.750
England International.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.190
But I'd love to measure exactly
what's going on when

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.450
our International footballer
takes a penalty under those

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.755
extreme tournament conditions.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.360
Here in the biomechanics lab,
we can take accurate

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.990
measurements of movement.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.080
The cameras and lights are on,
I'm wearing my black suit,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.580
I've got passive markers
all over me.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.470
I can sort of visualise the goal
in the distance, but the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.330
problem is it's just
not that realistic.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.130
It's like that problem in
quantum mechanics: the act of

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.000
measuring something
changes it.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.140
What we really want is a cheap
system that we can use out in

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.640
the field that measures
the player without

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.890
changing what he does.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.810
One way of doing that is to
take a video of a sporting

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:50.780
performance.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.870
And here we have a greyscale
video of a single tennis shot

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.540
during a game.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.310
We've tracked the ball, and we
can look at the brightness of

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.430
the pixels surrounding
the ball with time.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.590
And that gives us information
on speed, spin, and angle of

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.102
that shot, all with
a single camera.

00:02:06.102 --> 00:02:09.247
Now that's great, but it takes a
lot of number crunching, and

00:02:09.247 --> 00:02:12.090
we can only get the answer
after the performance.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.750
And as we've seen with our
previous film on diving, we

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.120
really want instantaneous
feedback.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.570
And what about bigger and more
complex sports like football?

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.490
Like any good engineer, we've
been looking at the tools for

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.140
a solution, and we've been
exploring a piece of

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.870
technology from a very different
source of game, the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.120
Xbox Kinect.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.470
John, you've been working on
the Kinect sensor for 18

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.110
months, and this is the first
time we've had the opportunity

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.920
to plug it into an Xbox and
play a game with it.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.560
Tell me how it works.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.385
Obviously, for us to be able
to play this game, what the

00:02:51.385 --> 00:02:54.530
Kinect's doing is working out
where we are in three

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.280
dimensions.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.830
And the way that it does that
is an infrared projector on

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.920
the sensor sends out a speckled
pattern of infrared

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.140
dots into the scene, and
compares the image that it

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.640
gets from its infrared camera
to an image that's stored on

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.220
the device.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.790
And the differences between
those two images tell the

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.610
Kinect not only where we are
in the image plane, the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.630
horizontal distances, but where
we are in terms of depth

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.840
away and towards the Kinect.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.610
In the lab here we've got a
really expensive bit of kit

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.260
that does exactly the same
thing, but costs

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.380
1,000 times as much.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.250
So please tell me that we
haven't wasted our money.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.850
Well, the accuracy of the Kinect
looks pretty good.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.860
We might be interested in the
location of a badminton player

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.140
on a court, for example.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.262
So we can locate the player
to around about 5 to 10

00:03:48.262 --> 00:03:51.670
centimetres of error, which, in
the context of the size of

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.300
the badminton court,
is pretty good.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.880
But for finer measurements, the
sort of measurements that

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.950
we might take in here with
this system, we might be

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.450
interested in measuring joint
angles or the positions of

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.740
body segments, we're not getting
the levels of accuracy

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:07.940
that we would see in the lab.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.280
But the benefit of the Kinect
is that it's cheap.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.730
It's essentially a commodity
item, and we can take the

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.980
Kinect out and take measurements
in the field, on

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.180
a player's badminton court, and
essentially where they're

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.730
performing.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.570
How long before we have one of
these out on a football pitch?

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.350
It's difficult to say, because
the drivers for this

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.120
technology have obviously been
the sort of thing that

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.800
normally happens in a living
room, over quite small areas.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.330
So it's difficult to know what
the drivers will be for the

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.730
development of the technology
to work over larger areas.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.810
Whoa.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:47.730
Who's winning?

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:48.980
I have no idea, Steve.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.740
We can take accurate
measurements within the

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.220
laboratory, but we're really
constrained by the

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.210
environment.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.390
Where we'd really like to be
is out here in the field

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.555
taking measurements of the
reality of our athletes.

00:05:04.555 --> 00:05:08.070
Now that's a tremendously
challenging thing to do, but

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.320
with image processing
techniques, with high

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.000
definition cameras, with depth
cameras, combined with mobile

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.060
technologies, I think we're
on the verge of

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.210
being able to do that.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.810
And for a sports engineer,
that's tremendously exciting.
