Hi, I'm Rob Powers from Clever Machine.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.219
We built our app Scenechronize using the google web toolkit.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.199
Scenechronize is an application designed for a producing team to make a movie or television program.

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:12.949
Let me show you the

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:19.079
application. Scenechronize is an application that's based around a script for a movie or a television production. The

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:22.159
user would first load in a PDF of their script

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.299
and we would parse it. We

00:00:23.299 --> 00:00:25.350
pull information about the scenes,

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.239
the locations, and the speaking characters directly out of the script.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.139
Um,

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:33.589
as you can see on the display here, the script is shown on the left side and

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:35.579
the user can scroll through. As

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:37.080
they scroll, the

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.720
page updates to show

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.139
various information for the current scene. The

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:42.769
user can also navigate

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:44.969
using the pearls along the top

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.019
by just clicking and it will directly go to that scene.

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:52.039
Or also, using the list box along the left side.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.079
Let's go take a look at a scene that has some information in it that

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.319
would be typical in a production that's in progress.

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:01.649
In this particular scene, you

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.250
can see that on the right, there are a number of

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.329
items that are described. These

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.790
are the various

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.479
pieces for that scene that are going to be needed when shooting occurs.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.659
These would include the characters with speaking parts as well as non-speaking parts,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.479
extras, animals,

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:18.919
picture vehicles,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.299
sound effects that needs

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:23.919
to happen, set information,

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.709
and the like.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.329
to add new items into the

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.250
scene, you can either

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.439
click on part

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.909
of the ui on the right, or you can tag. And

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:35.799
tagging is simply a selection in the script itself,

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:38.139
telling it what item category

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:39.369
you're including.

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:41.529
In this case, we have a camera

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:43.349
that's needed for scene 21 and

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:45.679
we already have an existing camera in the system. So

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.789
we can select the existing element and

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.969
it gets displayed right on the screen.

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:55.029
For more information about any of the items, you can click on them.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.119
And that comes, it will show a list of scenes that that particular item is used in. In this case, we're looking at a character

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.969
called David from this movie.

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.449
Uh, he's used in, he appears in 73 scenes and there

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.430
were a number of actors that were considered for the

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.370
role. For the actors, you

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:13.499
can click

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.500
onto any of the options that were

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.790
considered

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:19.880
and see pictures as well as other biographical data. You

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.589
can choose the appropriate actor that's actually going to be used in the movie on this screen.

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:31.100
Um, you can notice that as soon as you select one, if we switch tabs, it will be reflected immediately there.

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:33.570
Any reporting that gets done on the project will

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.190
include the latest update as soon as you enter it.

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.279
Another use for our application is

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:41.080
for scheduling a production.

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:47.479
The tool that's used in the industry is something called a strip board, and what we have provided is an electronic version of that.

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.500
It's basically a list of scenes,

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:52.699
each one as a "strip" that are

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.760
broken down by shooting day. Our

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:57.860
application uses a drag and drop interface that

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.770
allows the user to pull,

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.750
uh, one or more

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.110
of these strips

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.070
around the stripboard as needed. As

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.369
those changes happen, things

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.550
like the number of pages that are being shot that day

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:13.229
updates live. The

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.909
rich interface that our app provides

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.150
allows users to work in an environment that is comfortable to them

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:22.540
while providing a lot of data in a small amount of screen real estate. We

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:27.220
chose to use GWT for our application because it allowed us to write in Java,

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.440
which opened up the wide range of tools that are available for Java-based apps.

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.520
This allowed us to maintain the app,

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:36.889
refactor the code, and most importantly, debug it

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:40.440
much more easily than if we'd been writing in Javascript directly. We

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:44.029
tried a few of the other Javascript libraries available, and

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:46.500
we found that our code was slower

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.940
and more bug-prone than when we were using GWT. One of

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.039
the other advantages of GWT is because it is

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:55.149
multi-browser, it supports multiple browsers,

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.919
we're able to actually write our app so that it looks the same and works the same

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:01.029
across four major browser types. As

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.449
far as the user is concerned,

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:04.930
they don't know that

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:06.839
there's a difference between them,

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:07.930
but uhm, the

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:11.430
code is obviously quite different because of the GWT compiler's output.

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.739
We extended the GWT widget library so that we could use a custom MVC layer that we built,

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.640
and this allowed us to minimize the

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.339
amount of data that needed to be called into the client

00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:29.200
and simplified the client coding so that we were less prone to introducting bugs due

00:04:29.329 --> 00:04:31.619
to custom data request, uh,

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:32.329
data requests

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:33.850
that we

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:35.769
would need to make.

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:38.010
We utilize the

00:04:38.109 --> 00:04:41.970
plug-in architecture of the GWT RPC layer to support the back end of that.

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:47.559
So as a user needs data, we can pull it piecemeal, piece by piece, from the server. And

00:04:47.739 --> 00:04:52.519
as they make changes to things, we can push the changes live back to the

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:54.950
server. Overall we've been very happy with our experience with GWT,

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:58.160
and our app has been much better as a result.
