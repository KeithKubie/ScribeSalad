00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.960
The function, f of x is equal
to 6x squared plus 18x plus 12

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.039
over x squared minus
4, is not defined

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.010
at x is equal to
positive or negative 2.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.395
And we see why that is, if x is
equal to positive or negative 2

00:00:14.395 --> 00:00:17.400
then x squared is going
to be equal to positive 4,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.419
and 4 minus 4 is
0, and then we're

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:20.960
going to have a 0
in the denominator.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.100
And that's not defined.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.600
We don't know what that happens
when you divide-- well we've

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.210
never defined what happens
when you divide by 0.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.100
So they say, what value should
be assigned to f of negative 2

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.766
to make f of x
continuous at that point?

00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.140
So to think about
that, let's try

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.530
to actually simplify f of x.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.220
So f of x-- I'll just rewrite
it-- is equal to-- Actually let

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.490
me just start simplifying
right from the get go.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.640
So in the numerator
I can factor out a 6

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.480
out of every one of those terms.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.810
So it's 6 times
x squared plus 3x

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.360
plus 2 over-- and
the denominator, this

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.690
is a difference of squares.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.200
This is x plus 2
times x minus 2.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.340
And then we can factor
this expression up here.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.860
So this is going to
be equal to 6 times--

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.530
let me do it a different color.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.120
So we think of two numbers
and if I take their product

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.750
I get 2.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.530
If I take their sum I get 3.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.570
The most obvious one is 2 and 1.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.287
So this is 6 times x
plus 2 times x plus 1.

00:01:22.287 --> 00:01:23.870
When you take the
product there you'll

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.010
get x squared plus 3x
plus 2, and then all

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.000
of that over x plus
2 times x minus 2.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.120
Now, if we know that x
does not equal negative 2.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.210
Then we can divide both the
numerator and the denominator

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.530
by x plus 2.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.630
The reason why I'm
making that constraint

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.410
is that if x were to
be equal to negative 2

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.695
then x plus 2 is going
to be equal to 0.

00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:53.070
And you won't be
able to do that.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.570
You can't.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.250
We don't know what it means
divide something by 0.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.760
So we could say
that this is going

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.390
to be equal to-- so we
can divide the numerator

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.950
and denominator by x plus 2 but
we have to assume that x is not

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.290
equal to negative 2.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:13.980
So this is equal to 6 times--
we're going divided by x plus 2

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.290
in the numerator, x plus
2 in the denominator--

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.460
so it's going to be 6 times
x plus 1 over x minus 2.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.220
And we have to put
the constraint here

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.428
because now we've changed it.

00:02:28.428 --> 00:02:30.600
Now this expression
over here is actually

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.630
defined at x equals negative 2.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.970
But in order to be equivalent
to the original function

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.370
we have to constrain it.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:45.041
So we will say for x
not equal to negative 2.

00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:47.290
And it's also obvious that
x can't be equal to 2 here.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.590
This one also isn't
defined at positive 2

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.030
because you're dividing by 0.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.450
So you could say, for x does not
equal to positive or negative

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.080
2 if you want to make
it very explicit.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.400
But they ask us, what could
we assign f of negative 2

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.030
to make the function
continuous at the point?

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.020
Well the function is completely
equivalent to this expression

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.420
except that the function is not
defined at x equals negative 2.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.230
So that's why we have to
put that constraint here

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.510
if we wanted this to be the same
thing as our original function.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.530
But if we wanted to
re-engineer the function so it

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.320
is continuous at that
point then we just

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.270
have to set f of x equal to
whatever this expression would

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.710
have been when x is
equal to negative 2.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.460
So let's think about that.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.470
Let's think about that.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:43.400
So 6 times negative 2 plus
1 over negative 2 minus 2

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.750
is equal to-- this is
6 times negative 1.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:54.650
So it's negative 6 over negative
4, which is equal to 3/2.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:06.210
So if we redefine f of x, if
we say f of x is equal to 6x

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:13.960
squared plus 18x plus 12
over x squared minus 4.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:20.870
For x not equal
positive or negative

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:28.630
2, and it's equal to 3/2
for x equals negative 2.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.740
Now this function is going
to be the exact same thing

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.740
as this right over here.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.370
This f of x, this new one.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.380
This new definition--
this extended definition

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.880
of our original one-- is now
equivalent to this expression,

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.140
is equal to 6 times x
plus 1 over x minus 2.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.670
But just to answer
their question,

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.910
what value should be
assigned to f of negative 2

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.010
to make f of x
continuous to that point?

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.855
Well f of x should be-- or f
of negative 2 should be 3/2.
