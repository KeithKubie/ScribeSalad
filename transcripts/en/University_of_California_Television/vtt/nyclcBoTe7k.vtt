(upbeat techno music)

00:00:45.248 --> 00:00:46.990
- Welcome to a Conversation with History,

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.820
I'm Harry Kreisler of the Institute

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.430
of International Studies.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.210
Our guest today is Alexandra Horowitz,

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.930
who is an Adjunct Associate
Professor of Psychology

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.480
at Barnard College, Columbia University.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.190
She's the author of On Looking,

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.930
Eleven Walks with Expert Eyes,

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.930
and Inside of a Dog, What
Dogs See, Smell, and Know.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.770
Alexandra, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.460
- Thanks, Harry.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.530
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.220
- I was born in Philadelphia,

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.330
and I mostly grew up in Colorado.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.070
My father moved out to Colorado,

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.720
and so I was a quasi-westerner early on.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.040
- And looking back, how did your parents

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.103
influence your thinking about the world?

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.150
- Oh a lot.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.410
Both my parents were trained as attorneys,

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.620
my dad still practices.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.550
And I think they have a
very analytical approach

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.330
to problem solving, to thinking.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.500
That was instilled in me
from a pretty early age.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.370
- And what was the conversation like

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.190
at the dinner table, about world events,

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.260
about science, about what?

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.250
Or about the law?

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.410
- Well in some ways,
sometimes it was about the law

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.450
actually, we talked about
the law a fair amount.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.560
And that was pretty intriguing,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.470
'cause there's the process
and I was interested

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.070
in understanding the process,

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.770
and seeing that you could
come to an end of a process.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.300
But also just about ordinary things.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.160
What happened in the day,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.250
and really analyzing what
happened in our days,

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.750
or social interaction, or,

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.090
you know not just reporting

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.150
but also kind of
ruminating on what it was.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.150
So we could have a long conversation about

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.530
a one little incident that happened

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.170
at the grocery store, at school,

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.470
or walking the dog.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.980
- And when did you acquire your first dog,

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.750
if acquire is the right word?

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.780
- I know, ownership is a
broad question. (laughs)

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.450
- So when--

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.160
- At that time we were
all owners though, right?

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.090
- Yeah, yes, yeah.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.290
- And our family lived with dogs

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.123
as long as I remember,

00:02:48.123 --> 00:02:50.400
I think from the time I was very young

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.480
we had a dog.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.800
My first dog I remember was
maybe a dog named Heidi,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.150
when I was six.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.350
And then I grew up with a dog,

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.010
and even in college, I maybe
had a year or two in college

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.550
where I didn't live with a dog,

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.020
and then I had dogs in college.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.580
So I actually have always lived with dogs.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.397
- When you were younger
and the family had a dog,

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.410
did you find yourself observing them?

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.390
Were you a scientist in
becoming at that point,

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.440
or was it just the
friendship relationship?

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.140
- I don't think I, I don't remember being

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.630
scientific in my approach
to the dog at all.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.220
I think what I had was a
sensitivity to animals,

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.220
and plants actually, I think
I was just kind of worried

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.680
about their experience, or
what was happening with them.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.820
Not to say I couldn't forget,

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.050
I wasn't that sensitive a kid.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.430
But I wasn't analyzing them.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.580
I just wanted to be assured
of their well being.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.860
And that I can remember
from a very early age.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.359
- Mm-hmm, and so when did,

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.130
what were your first
steps towards science?

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.930
Was that when you went to college?

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.355
Or even before then?

00:04:10.355 --> 00:04:11.950
- I had interest in science,

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.990
but not behavioral science exactly.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.694
You know, I was very
interested in physics.

00:04:15.694 --> 00:04:19.930
Again, I liked the iterative process

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.770
that led to a result.

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.670
So that's very satisfying in math

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.440
and in science as a
secondary school student.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.530
In college I got very
interested in philosophy,

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.733
and it actually diverted me
from science a little bit,

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.960
but was ultimately I think
frustrating for that reason,

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.490
wanting to come to a kind of end point,

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.150
or at least periotic tentative end points

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.550
that science allows you
to progress through.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.360
So it wasn't until after I earned my BA

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.490
and I was working, and
away from academics,

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.990
that I started thinking that
I'd like to know more about

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.000
some of these topics that
I had just forgotten about.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.330
You know, in pursuing philosophy
in particular cognition,

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.868
so that's when I started taking classes

00:05:04.868 --> 00:05:07.450
and I wound up applying to a PhD program.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.907
- Mm-hmm, and where did you do your PhD?

00:05:09.907 --> 00:05:12.470
- At University of California San Diego

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.290
in the Cognitive Science Department.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.290
- And that, so you're a
cognitive psychologist,

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.167
but are you also a zoologist, or?

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.010
- Well you could almost say that.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.550
I mean in a way you get to be a little bit

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.950
of a jack of all trades
as a cognitive scientist

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.470
because the field itself was formed

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.160
by philosophers, and psychologists,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.120
and neuroscientists, and anthropologists,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.080
and computer scientists
who were all realizing

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.940
that they were asking similar questions,

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.500
just approaching it a different way.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.281
Artificial intelligence wants
to know about the brain,

00:05:49.281 --> 00:05:51.510
and neuroscientists want to know

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.718
whether the ideas of the brain
could be mapped, programmed,

00:05:55.718 --> 00:05:58.270
and then there are observers of behavior,

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.320
and testers of behavior and so forth.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.320
So from that position,

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:10.313
I could be called any one of
those things a little bit.

00:06:10.313 --> 00:06:12.030
I've never been called a neuroscientist

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.640
or computer scientist but,

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.010
I started studying animal behavior

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.440
and became a little bit
of what I would call

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.690
a cognitive ethologist, right.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.060
Somebody who's looking at
animal behavior naturally,

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.330
and observing, and then trying to make

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.800
inferences about cognition.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.590
- Mm-hmm, and at San Diego were there any

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.170
particular people that you worked with?

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:35.850
Who did you do your dissertation on,

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.850
and then how did you come
to this focus on dogs?

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.430
- I came to the focus on dogs
a little bit accidentally,

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.900
so I did start to get
interested in animal cognition,

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.380
and what kind of inferences
we can make about

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.950
non-human animal minds.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.320
And I was doing research with people who

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.190
were studying the cognitive
behavior of animals,

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.510
the bonobos for instance,

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.956
or the social behavior of animals.

00:07:01.956 --> 00:07:05.720
I joined a rhinoceros
observation research project

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.063
at the Wild Animal Park
under Ron Swaysgood.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.180
But then I got interested in dogs

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.070
because I was interested
in the topic of play

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.900
as a natural behavior,

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.740
which is so interesting
in human development,

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.870
and what might let us see something

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.130
that allow us to make some inference

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.230
about what the dogs understand or no.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.360
And so you'd look for a playing animal,

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.610
and nobody I knew there
was studying an animal

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.160
who was playing all the time.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.230
You know you could go
and watch the bonobos

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.540
and they'd play once in a while,

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.430
and then they'd go off in the private area

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.150
of the enclosure and they'd play

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.920
and you don't see them.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.240
But I realized I was watching
play three times a day.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.860
You know I had a dog and
I would watch him play.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.440
And so I got interested in studying dogs

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.990
and there was no one studying dogs

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.183
at UC San Diego, at least not in this way.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:57.970
But Mark Beckoff, who was
at UC Boulder in Colorado,

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.287
had studied dogs as a
biologist for a long time.

00:08:00.287 --> 00:08:02.400
And I got in touch with him,

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.160
and really learned distance from him

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.150
how to look at dog behavior,

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.170
and then at UC San Diego, Shirley Strum

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:13.313
in the Anthropology Department,
who studies baboons,

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:19.550
took me under her wing
to help me refine my

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.490
ethology technique, and Jeff Elman,

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.640
who was just somebody
who could do anything,

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.520
a kind of renaissance intellect

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.610
in the Cognitive Science Department,

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.040
took me on intellectually.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.790
So I had these, a distant
mentor in Mark Beckoff,

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:39.180
and Shirley Strum and Jeff
Elman were my committee chairs.

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.700
- Well I can't help but ask you this.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.222
Do you think there was a bias against dogs

00:08:43.222 --> 00:08:47.380
in the sense that no one,
at least at San Diego,

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.640
had taken in the sense that

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.810
we sort of take them for granted?

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.235
- Oh yeah, oh for sure.

00:08:53.235 --> 00:08:55.390
There was a huge bias against dogs,

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:57.710
and I shared that bias against dogs.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.910
When I thought about it,

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.257
or somebody might have proposed to me,

00:09:02.257 --> 00:09:03.900
"Maybe you could study
dogs, they're playing."

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.960
And I really scoffed at the idea.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.975
First of all, if you were interested

00:09:06.975 --> 00:09:08.920
in non-human animal minds

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.320
you were gonna be looking
at a primate probably.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:16.230
Because what, non-human
primates are gonna be

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:19.260
the most connected to us.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.460
And so therefore the ones that have

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.400
the interesting answers to
the questions you wanna ask.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.910
And dogs are so familiar.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:29.160
I think, I've tried to think
back on why it could be

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.970
that dogs were rejected
as a cognitive subject

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.220
in 1996 or something,

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.590
and I think it was just we already had

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:38.680
this vocabulary to talk about dogs.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.100
And so no one was studying dogs.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.620
I remember a well-known
primatologist coming

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:46.910
and visiting campus,
and I had just started

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.850
to observe dogs, and I said,

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:50.948
gee, I think there's really something,

00:09:50.948 --> 00:09:52.240
this might've been 1998.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.870
There's something really interesting here,

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:55.770
and what do you think about this?

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.450
And he really laughed at that idea.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:03.450
And now he and many
others are studying dogs.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.110
It's really exploded as an
interesting research topic.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.210
And I think a lot of
people had that realization

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.343
right at the same time in
different parts of the world.

00:10:12.343 --> 00:10:14.500
There's a big group in
Hungary, for instance,

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.333
that was studying dogs.

00:10:15.333 --> 00:10:18.690
- And is it the case that,

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:22.480
I mean, I don't think your
research has gone there yet but

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.420
that dogs in a way in
our closeness to dogs

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:28.750
could tell us really something
about humans basically,

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:32.010
in the sense that the
interaction between the two,

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:32.913
dogs and humans.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:36.000
- Certainly, yeah, insofar as

00:10:37.824 --> 00:10:42.180
they are in many ways
reflecting the process

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.947
of our ancestors for
some thousands of years.

00:10:45.947 --> 00:10:49.140
They reflect our selection of them, right?

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:53.860
We might've chosen and decided to breed,

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.110
intentionally or not,

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.860
those animals that had traits

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.140
that were most familiar, or pleasing,

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.870
or recognizable, you know,

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.600
reflected us, mirrored us in some way.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.370
And so they're a demonstration of

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.380
what we think is important in a companion

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.213
in some ways,

00:11:10.213 --> 00:11:13.400
and I think that makes them
good companion animals,

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.940
and such easy companion animals.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.350
So there is a lot of
interesting research, I think,

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.060
which is comparative in that sense.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.953
I'm more interested in a dog qua-dog,

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:27.352
but yeah, they reflect
back on us, certainly.

00:11:27.352 --> 00:11:29.320
- Have you ever thought of a comparison

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.300
between dogs and cats basically,

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.810
in the sense that they're very different.

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:36.300
- As domesticated creatures, right?

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.680
- Yeah, as domesticated creatures, yeah.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.600
- Right, and the selection process

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.943
must've been much different for cats.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.580
And that's because maybe you're starting

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.360
with a really different species

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.030
that doesn't have the
same kind of sociality

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.920
and interactions in their groups

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.483
as the proto-dog or
ancestor wolf did in theirs.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.764
But also they're much less
willing subjects, cats.

00:12:03.764 --> 00:12:04.760
(laughing)

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.380
So that's probably limited.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.720
There's probably a bias
against cat cognition research

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.540
because the cats you know,

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.960
just won't walk into
the laboratory with you.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.780
- So what did you wind up doing
your dissertation on then?

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:19.540
- I did it on the behaviors
of theory of mind,

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:24.540
this meta-cognitive concept
that we apply to humans,

00:12:25.206 --> 00:12:28.010
and a kind of case study of dogs at play.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:33.010
So dyadic interactions between
dogs, rough and tumble play.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.820
So I was assessing that play behavior

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.590
and seeing if there was
anything that looked like

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.070
it was a precursor to or rudimentary

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:44.920
understanding of other's minds.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.370
- Others being--

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:47.203
- Dogs.

00:12:47.203 --> 00:12:48.904
- Dogs, yeah, other dogs.

00:12:48.904 --> 00:12:49.987
- Other dogs.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:55.260
- I like to ask my guests what they see

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:59.640
as the skills involved in what you do,

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.700
and how do you train to
acquire those skills?

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.320
- I think for my research

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.433
it's mostly about
patience and observation.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.660
A lot of my research
has to do with watching.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:17.660
And somehow that's a
kind of attention skill

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:22.520
that we don't develop that much

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.950
in normal schooling, I think.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:27.930
Not just seeing, but really observing.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:29.660
And one way that's easier to do that

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.670
is observing through video playback.

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:36.340
So you videotape a lot of
episodes of a behavior,

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:37.900
and you watch it in slow motion,

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.433
and you start seeing
something different happening.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.960
And so that's where
patience really comes in.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.300
I mean watching dogs play is great fun,

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.740
but the science of it only happens

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.712
when you're watching a 30th
of a second of it at a time

00:13:53.712 --> 00:13:58.712
of that video playback,
which is extremely tedious

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.583
in writing sequential behaviors down so,

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:07.410
a 30 second playback might
take hours to code effectively.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:10.500
And so you have to be
interested in observation,

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.693
and then you have to be very
patient to deconstruct it.

00:14:14.693 --> 00:14:15.840
- When you say code,

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.110
explain to our audience
what you mean by that.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:22.950
- So any behavior, any
anthropologist or ethologist

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:26.999
would be interested in finding out

00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:28.450
the parts of that behavior.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:30.340
We might say, an interview
is happening here

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.410
but what constitutes that interview.

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.810
And there are various levels
at which you could describe

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.603
this behavior that's happening between us.

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:42.290
And we choose some level,

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:44.145
and we're not interested
in finger movements

00:14:44.145 --> 00:14:46.730
or limb extensions,

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:49.590
but instead maybe we're
interested in the conversation.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:53.530
And a code would be
making a representation

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:57.080
such that you could look
at lots of different

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.540
instances of conversations
and if there are

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.110
patterns that are similar
across those coded behaviors.

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.870
- And in the case of a dog who

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.830
when you come to the study of the dog,

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:11.700
there isn't an enormous literature

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.510
that this breakdown becomes,

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.050
there's just an awful lot going on,

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:18.520
that it's only through this kind of

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.940
careful observation that you can see that.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.480
- Right, I think we see play for instance,

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.530
in dogs as a unitary behavior.

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:29.400
It's just, they're playing,

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.430
then that's kind of the
end of the assessment

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:32.700
of what's happening.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.760
But you could break it down
into smaller components,

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.060
you could look at how they're using

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:40.340
each other's attention
when they're communicating.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.130
You could look at dominance,
missive behaviors,

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:43.610
lots of ways you could do it.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.390
And I used an ethogram,
a list of behaviors

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:50.660
to code the behaviors I was looking at

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.500
from Mark Beckoff and other people

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.860
who had studied dog behavior.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:58.570
And also from people who'd
studied other animal behaviors.

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:02.360
So ethologists all use each
others ethograms to get ideas

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.090
about what are the kinds of behaviors

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:05.893
we might see in this animal.

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:09.540
And now there are pretty exhaustive lists

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:12.550
of ethograms of different
animal's behaviors.

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:15.600
- So in a way it becomes like

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:20.000
reading encrypted
conversations between humans.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.603
In other words, once you
break the encryption,

00:16:23.455 --> 00:16:26.060
there's a whole conversation going on,

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.700
whether between dogs or
between dogs and humans.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.010
- Right, that make the
conversation work, right,

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:35.513
or that make the play work,
the constituent elements.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:40.060
Now your analogy only
breaks down insofar as

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.580
that doesn't mean we suddenly understand

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:42.867
it's meaning all the time,

00:16:42.867 --> 00:16:46.970
but we certainly have analyzed
it at a different level.

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.400
And so we might have gained
another appreciation for

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:54.400
for instance, how dogs
use turn taking in play,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.300
even if we don't understand play.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:01.863
- And so you're really
exposing the complexity,

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:08.270
which might be an entry
point to other complexities

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.860
in the relationship of dogs to each other.

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:14.340
- Yeah, absolutely, I mean
I got interested in play

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:19.340
because it's a context
in which it's possible.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:24.780
In humans we learn a lot
of understanding of others,

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.810
so by playing with this
real, pretend distinction

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:31.240
early in childhood, we
might start realizing oh,

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.830
there's more than one way to view this

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.360
banana I'm holding up to my ear.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.030
It's not just a banana,
but it's also a phone.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:41.210
And then oh, that person in front of me

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:42.710
might not know the things I do,

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:43.960
they know something else.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.480
That seems to be part of that development.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:49.080
So one wonders if one looks
at play in other species

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.300
if they're also based on an understanding

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.430
that the dogs would use in other context,

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:58.590
which is of another animal's perspective.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.630
That they know, or believe,
or think different things

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:04.180
than that dog believes.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:08.300
- What are their qualities of
temperament besides patient?

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:11.430
It sounds like there's
a lot of empathy really.

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:12.263
Is that--?

00:18:12.263 --> 00:18:15.900
- For me that definitely was a grounding

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.640
for my interest in
looking at animals, right,

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.390
and I think that's probably the case

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:24.623
for a lot of other animal
behavior researchers.

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:31.030
And a real sense of connection
with a non-human animal

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:36.590
of any kind, and an interest,

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:39.360
a curiosity about other animals.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:44.360
And desire to not just
have a simple answer

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:45.860
as to what the animal is doing,

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:46.860
what the animal is feeling,

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.600
but to really analyze their behavior

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.890
before jumping to any conclusion.

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:54.520
- Now what was your goal in writing

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.640
The Inside of the Dog?

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:01.640
Obviously in part it was
reporting on your research,

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.000
but beyond that were there
other goals involved here?

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.670
- You know I was then a dog researcher,

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.800
I had gotten interested
in the dog as the dog,

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.780
as opposed to just this
theory of mind entry

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.220
into non-human animal minds.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:20.760
And I lived with dogs,
and one of my interests

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.270
was in that tension,
being a scientist of dogs

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:28.910
and also an owner or liver with dogs.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:32.070
And how we have two
different approaches to dogs.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:34.410
So I was wearing two
different hats all the time.

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:37.440
You know the ways you deal
with the dog in your house,

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.380
and the ways we looked
at dogs analytically,

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:43.740
and an interest to bring
the latter to the former.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:46.430
Not just for me but for other owners,

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:51.070
and saying, ah, these are
questions we form about our dogs.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:51.903
What do they know?

00:19:51.903 --> 00:19:52.736
What are they thinking?

00:19:52.736 --> 00:19:53.569
What do they understand?

00:19:53.569 --> 00:19:54.770
What do they think of me,

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:55.817
people would always ask me,

00:19:55.817 --> 00:19:57.800
"What does my dog think of me?"

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.930
And is there anything I
could bring from my approach

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:04.860
or my results or the other dog
researchers results to date

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.490
which would bear on those questions.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:10.360
So it's realizing that
there's a universe of people

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.670
who live with dogs who
have questions about them,

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:15.310
and that now there's this science

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.073
that wasn't that well
reported on at that point,

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.653
which would be fascinating to them.

00:20:22.643 --> 00:20:27.643
- What is, in your work, what
does creativity look like?

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:32.520
I mean can you tell us
about an ah-ha moment

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:36.130
where you suddenly came on something

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:39.190
that was really surprising for you

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:40.960
in the area of play?

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.050
- Well it was, I guess I
have a couple possibilities

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:45.440
that leap to my mind.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.210
One was even finding out
about the possibility of dogs

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.440
as a cognitive subject,

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.410
and that happened through
reading Mark Beckoff

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.970
and Collin Allen's book, Species of Mind.

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:58.470
And I distinctly remember Mark,

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:01.873
who was studying the
behavior of dogs in play,

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.074
made a suggestion that
maybe there's something

00:21:07.074 --> 00:21:10.400
about shared intentionality,

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.830
understanding of intentionality

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.070
in these play bows that
they do, the play signals,

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:19.070
which seemed to be something
like a request for play,

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.250
or an announcement that
I'm about to play with you,

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:24.490
and perceive play, and
continue throughout play,

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:26.240
and are very important for play.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.670
And so he just made the suggestion

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:32.830
that there was something
meta-cognitive basically,

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:35.820
about the dog's very simple act

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.010
of going down on their front legs

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:40.840
with the rump high in the
air, wagging their tail.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.260
And that was, that moment
was really inspiring

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:48.060
'cause I was very interested
in the meta-cognitive aspects,

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:51.120
or possibilities in
non-human animal minds.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.880
You know, are they
thinking about thinking,

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.900
are they think about other's thinking?

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.090
And here was somebody saying
a very simple behavior,

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:58.590
if you looked at the context,

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:00.010
might be connected to that.

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:03.110
So I thought, whoa,
I've gotta look at that.

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:05.220
And that's really what I then spent

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.440
two years of research looking at.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.793
So that was a big moment.

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.760
And I also think before I
started writing this book

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.040
and I got interested in more of how

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.630
the science could elucidate
the experience of the dog,

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:24.450
I was reading other
biologists and came across

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:27.860
Jakob von Uexkull who was influential

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:32.860
in some areas of animal behavior research,

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:36.559
but had kind of fallen out
of the popular literature,

00:22:36.559 --> 00:22:40.430
he wasn't really in favor
I guess, 20 years ago

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.060
in animal behavior research.

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.410
You didn't really hear his name a lot.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:47.493
But he had this idea,
the umwelt of the animal,

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.810
that you could imagine the world view,

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:55.810
the soap bubble in which
any animal existed,

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:58.850
defined by the things that
are important or salient

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:02.440
in their environment, in
their own sensory capacity,

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.460
and that really tickled me.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.680
I realized he's telling me how to find out

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.460
what the experience of the dog is,

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:13.350
which is figure out what's
important in their environment

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:14.810
from their point of view,

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:16.700
watch their behavior to do that,

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:19.070
and understand their senses,

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:21.620
and therefore get a different picture

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:24.800
of what they experience in
a space, and we can do that.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.180
And so that was a big moment too.

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.790
And that's still very
influential in my thinking

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:33.191
about how to research dog behavior.

00:23:33.191 --> 00:23:38.191
- In a way that sort of defines
the agenda for your book,

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.580
and I wanna walk you through your book,

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:45.580
and you really identify three broad areas

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:49.420
that you wanna look at.

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.520
State what those are,

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.460
and then I'll walk you
through each of them.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.500
- The sensory areas?

00:23:55.500 --> 00:24:00.373
Well, olfaction, that's
a huge sensory area.

00:24:02.299 --> 00:24:03.870
There's a visual area,

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:07.170
and who's gonna be in their visual space,

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:09.453
and I'm not sure what the third area--

00:24:09.453 --> 00:24:11.480
- Well I guess what I
meant was the overall

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.313
framework of the book,

00:24:12.313 --> 00:24:15.270
so it's looking at the dog's origins,

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:17.120
it's sensibilities--
- then their senses.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.250
- Yeah, then their senses,

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.100
and then their interactions with humans.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.790
- That's true, all right
so right, absolutely.

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:24.360
- That's how I saw the book.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.193
- That's great.

00:24:25.193 --> 00:24:26.980
Well you know, everybody
reads it a different way.

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:28.820
That is all in there.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.363
Right, so where does this dog come from,

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:37.030
who is the dog, and then what
are their sensory capacities,

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:41.703
perceptual experiences, and then humans,

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:44.010
and what do they see of us,

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:47.350
and how have we influenced their biology,

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:49.800
and the interaction and bond.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.790
- So let's begin with the origins.

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:56.010
They come, their origins
are in the family of wolves,

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:57.820
I guess you could say,

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:02.510
but we don't think about having a wolf

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:03.943
in our house these days.

00:25:05.333 --> 00:25:07.670
- And I don't think there's
any atavistic possibility

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:09.920
that the dog is going to
become the wolf again.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.120
- Right, right, maybe on television,

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.620
but we'll leave that aside.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:18.810
But so what, talk a little about that,

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:21.200
because as I read your book,

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.480
what you're saying basically is

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:27.550
it drew some positive things
from coming from that line.

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:28.850
But on the other hand,

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.860
there were major changes in its evolution.

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:34.630
So what is it about a wolf

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:39.630
that could be the
starting point for a dog?

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:41.903
- Well I'll say first of all

00:25:41.903 --> 00:25:43.970
that I think the domestication story

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:46.780
is still unfolding, right,

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.070
there are still people who are trying to,

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:53.800
and claim to find the earliest examples of

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:58.440
the divergence between
the early canine ancestor

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.710
kind of wolf and dogs.

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:02.550
And it might've happened
in multiple places.

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:04.980
But it looks like at some point,

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.940
one of the best theories is
really Ray Copenger's theory

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:12.560
which is that dogs, or proto-dogs,

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.210
some wolves kind of self selected

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:19.200
right about when humans were becoming

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:23.000
less nomadic and having settlements.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.720
And with any settlements
you kind of create

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.940
trash outside of your settlement.

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.963
The food that goes
uneaten, the early dumps.

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:37.453
And some wolves might have,
already a social species,

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:43.240
felt less wary of this
animal in their environment,

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.120
and approached this new food source,

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.280
a new ecological niche basically,

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:51.170
that we created inadvertently,

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:53.410
and therefore came into closer proximity

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:54.720
with these early humans.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:59.580
And then might have started
to be taken in by us,

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:03.600
and maybe because some of
them were appealing to us

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.490
as puppies, maybe partly for
food, something like that,

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:09.420
and then artificial
selection started after that.

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.960
So this was a species,
and I wanna make clear,

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.400
it wasn't today's wolf, right,

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.940
it was some ancestor of today's wolf.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.820
So we look at the wolf today and we think,

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.510
well the dog came from that wolf,

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:21.820
but of course that wolf has also evolved

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:26.110
over thousands of years
from this common ancestor.

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:29.210
Some early wolf must
have had a reduction of

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:31.963
reactivity to humans
and felt less fearful,

00:27:33.485 --> 00:27:36.930
and therefore allowed for the possibility

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:39.070
that we could come into interaction.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:42.670
And we created an environmental scenario

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:46.070
that encouraged the possibility
of that interaction.

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:48.926
And then some spark happened between us.

00:27:48.926 --> 00:27:53.373
- And you're saying that wolves,

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:58.260
these ancestor wolves brought to the table

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:03.260
characteristics that were
useful for this transition

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:05.391
that helped make it possible,

00:28:05.391 --> 00:28:09.070
and you describe the
relationship of the wolf

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:10.880
to his own pack,

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:14.960
and then the adaptation and flexibility of

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:19.520
the ancestor wolf in its original setting.

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:23.240
- Right, so wolves are social already.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.380
They live in social groups
and these are packs,

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.853
and these are really family units.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.950
So that's already mirroring us.

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:32.740
It happens with other social mammals too,

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:35.070
but that's already mirroring
something about us.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:37.260
We're living in extended family units

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:38.610
and so are wolves.

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:43.610
And the alpha pair are really
the eldest of this family.

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:46.880
And so that's a very tight knit group.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.530
They're somewhat territorial,

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:51.160
but extremely filiative with each other.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:56.160
And so that makes them
mirror, in some way,

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.490
the kind of human social relationship

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:02.670
that we have now, and
that we've always had.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:05.340
And so if only we could
start to see each other

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:07.020
as kind of con-specifics,

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:11.640
and they have some flexibility in that,

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:16.280
at least the dogs that we've selected do,

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.850
then we could interweave
in each other's families.

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:21.810
So they must've had some early
developmental flexibility

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:25.160
such that the difference
between wolves and dogs now

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:29.020
is that dogs have a much
longer sort of sensitive period

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:32.520
where they could be
exposed to other species

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.910
and view them as con-specifics,

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:38.930
as you know is essentially
part of their own family.

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:41.690
Wolves are shorter, but
there must've been some

00:29:42.545 --> 00:29:46.370
sufficient extension in those
early self selecting wolves

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:49.430
so that they could come to accept a human.

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:54.430
- And you say in the book that
it's really a difference in

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.310
how long it takes for
the baby dog, or wolf,

00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:59.690
to open their eyes, which then,

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:04.190
in the case of the dog
there's a longer period

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:09.190
which is a threshold or a starting point

00:30:09.542 --> 00:30:13.910
for feeling affection for something

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:17.840
other than another dog, or the mother dog,

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:22.120
but they can extend it
to a different species.

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.170
- Right, essentially a sensitive period,

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:28.540
or critical period if you're talking about

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:32.580
some species of very
regimented, early window

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:35.980
for social exposure, or for hearing sounds

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.310
of other species and so forth,

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:39.310
it's critical period.

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:41.250
If it's a little bit looser
it's a sensitive period.

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:46.250
So some broader sensitive
window in the dog

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:48.463
eventually than in the wolf.

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.651
You know, Karma Lawrenz
discovered the idea,

00:30:52.651 --> 00:30:55.760
or popularized the idea
of the critical period,

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.780
and he famously exposed himself,

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:02.890
I mean that in the most literal way,

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:03.880
not in the extended way,

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:07.700
but he removed some
goslings from their mother,

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:12.180
and he was the first
individual those goslings saw

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.380
and they imprinted on him.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:17.800
So that's a kind of flexibility
that lots of animals have,

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.540
that is, whoever the
first creature is you see,

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:22.720
that's the one you attach
yourself to, and mimic,

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.143
and you're gonna rely on.

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:28.642
But it's a very brief window for geese,

00:31:28.642 --> 00:31:31.203
so it's a broader window for some mammals.

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:36.020
- Now let's talk about
what's inside the dog,

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:39.070
its senses, its sensibility, and so on,

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:41.880
and what is the most important thing

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:45.720
that we need to know about its senses?

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.380
Which is the most important?

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:49.700
- I think everyone knows at some level

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:52.640
that the dog is an olfactory creature.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:57.420
But they are entirely olfactory.

00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:59.000
You know, it's not that they
don't have other senses,

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.690
but as we are visual creatures,

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:03.650
and most of our experiences at this moment

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:05.730
are experiences of images,

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:08.613
not so much smells, and not so much,

00:32:08.613 --> 00:32:11.990
well there's hearing of
course, but not primarily,

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:16.370
our overarching experience is
visual, they are olfactory.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:20.920
And so that's, to then
really loiter in that fact

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:23.610
for a while, let's sit and steep in it,

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:25.320
and think about what it would be like

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.420
to be an olfactory creature

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.750
who's experience of this room

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:31.630
would not be of the sights,

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:35.490
but instead of places where
smells are coming from

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:38.223
or smells that are here from past guests,

00:32:39.219 --> 00:32:42.103
and passersby and so forth.

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:45.320
I think that's transformative,

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.320
to think of the dog that way.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.300
So they're not the only
olfactory creature,

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:52.510
but they're the only one
living in our homes as it were.

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:56.410
And so that's manifested
in a number of ways.

00:32:56.410 --> 00:33:01.410
You know they have many, many
more olfactory receptors,

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:04.950
which gives them exponentially
greater sensitivity

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:08.860
to the presence of any
smell than we would have.

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.370
They have a sophisticated
method of sniffing.

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:14.500
So just as we don't get enured

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.820
to something we're
looking at, or staring at,

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.960
they can keep smelling, inhaling,

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:24.540
without kind of exhaling
the smell out of their nose.

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:27.710
In fact, their exhales
kind of help their inhales.

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:31.110
You know they have this
secondary olfactory-like organ

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:34.380
called the vomeronasal
organ in the hard pallet

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:35.700
of the roof of the mouth

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:40.470
to allow smelling
hormones, emitted hormones,

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:42.210
obviously functionally adaptive

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:44.280
to deal with other
members of their species,

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:47.810
but also presumably they're
able to detent the hormones

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:51.713
that we're always giving
off, pheromones we call it.

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:56.024
So they're entirely
organized around smell,

00:33:56.024 --> 00:33:58.950
and their vision is perfectly good.

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:01.510
But I think that's the thing to realize

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:02.500
when trying to imagine

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.150
if one is really interested in imagining

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:05.250
the dog's point of view,

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:09.060
is that when we step out onto the street

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:12.550
and this world just appears
for us however it appears,

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:14.560
their world is appearing to them

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.620
as the smells passing on the breeze,

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:18.960
or whatever smells underfoot,

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.300
or left on that lamp post.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:26.300
- And in using the smell
strength so to speak,

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:33.630
they're acquiring information basically.

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:36.550
So what you're saying is

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:38.800
we need to think of it in that way

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.000
because they are learning
about their environment,

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.240
the people in the
environment through that,

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:49.230
and they're decoding the information.

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:52.110
- That's right, I think
that when we're using vision

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:53.417
we're getting information too, right?

00:34:53.417 --> 00:34:55.090
And we think of smells I think,

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:57.610
it's hard for us to imagine
being olfactory creatures

00:34:57.610 --> 00:35:01.990
because we assign smells a quality.

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:03.760
You know, it's like a
good smell or a bad smell,

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.430
or maybe their identities.

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:07.390
There are some people who are very good

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:09.180
at recognizing what the smells are,

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:11.140
but mostly we just kind of think

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.660
there are a set of smells we like

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.110
and a set of smells we don't like.

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:16.710
But we think of vision
as giving us information

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:18.490
about the world, this is where I am,

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:20.500
this is who was here,
this is what happened.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.750
I might see some sign that
somebody was here before,

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:26.470
and I think that's exactly
how they're drawing

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:28.970
a picture of their space with olfaction.

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:31.300
So it's not laden with is
this a good or bad smell,

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:32.490
it's whose smell is that?

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:34.600
And what information is there in the urine

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:39.600
that splattered this
hydrant about the urinator,

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:42.690
and her health, and her sexual status,

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:46.160
and maybe her stress hormone level.

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.370
I don't know, I mean
they're not exactly sure

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:49.250
what they could experience.

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:51.930
But they have the capacity to pull out

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:53.390
all those bits of information.

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:55.160
And so about humans as well.

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.711
Who passed by,

00:35:56.711 --> 00:35:59.880
hence the effectiveness of trackers who,

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.340
they don't need a foot step,

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:06.340
they just need somebody kind
of having sloughed our smell

00:36:06.945 --> 00:36:09.320
in our wake as we run away

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.980
for the dog to detect that we were there

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:11.813
sometime in the past.

00:36:11.813 --> 00:36:14.810
So yeah, they might even be smelling time

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:17.910
because the difference
between a strong odor

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:22.910
and a weak odor is
really when it was laid.

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:25.720
So a strong odor means
somebody passed more recently.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.230
So it is entirely information, yeah.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:31.510
- And you talk a little
about this whole question

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:36.510
whether dogs can tell whether
their companion is ill,

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:43.970
basically, their human companion
has a disease and so on.

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:46.660
- Sure, and there's no reason that the dog

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:47.760
wouldn't be able to smell that.

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:51.993
I mean any diseased cells give off

00:36:51.993 --> 00:36:53.550
a very distinctive smell.

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:55.683
I mean doctors used to be trained in,

00:36:56.830 --> 00:37:01.220
reliably trained in
the smells of diseases.

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:03.960
You know I think tuberculosis has

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:07.490
something like a brown bread smell.

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:10.860
So instead of just getting
a blood test from you,

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:12.450
a doctor might come over and just see

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:14.090
if you're giving off a smell

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:16.610
that would be informative
about you, right,

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:18.130
not good or bad but informative.

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:20.490
And so we're giving off those smells.

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:23.729
And we know that dogs can then detect

00:37:23.729 --> 00:37:28.729
the changes of tissue wrought
by cancer, for instance,

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:30.800
because dogs are easily trained,

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.010
and many have been trained

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:38.010
to alert to cancerous cells
in whatever the substrate.

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:40.550
On a body if it's melanoma,

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:42.580
or in urine if it's bladder cancer

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:43.440
they're trying to detect,

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:48.440
or in breath if it's lung cancer.

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:50.190
So they are detecting them.

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:52.260
Now that doesn't mean that everybody's dog

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:55.320
is looking for illness
in their owner, right,

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.390
but my guess is that they might notice it.

00:37:57.390 --> 00:38:02.070
And then if we ask them,
train them to tell us,

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:04.410
and we knew what their
telling us looked like,

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:06.560
then they could also tell us about it.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:07.730
- And do they compute?

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:12.070
In other words, is there
evidence that they can

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:15.060
combine their affection for someone

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:19.320
with this detection of disease

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.120
to then try to alert the person?

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.770
I mean that would be different than

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:26.180
just smelling a bunch of people

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:27.780
that they don't know for disease.

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:29.810
- Right, so you could be training on odor,

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:32.900
or a component inherent
in a cancer, for instance.

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:40.730
And that's what the dogs who
are trained to do this do.

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:43.530
And so your question is
really does familiarity

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:46.600
breed a kind of smell understanding

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.930
such that if there's a
violation of that understanding,

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:52.790
a change wrought be an illness,

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:54.370
a dog would detect it

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:57.473
and be able to tell you
about it essentially.

00:38:57.473 --> 00:38:59.478
- Because of their affection for you.

00:38:59.478 --> 00:39:01.890
- Yeah, well I guess I
was translating affection

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:05.420
as familiarity, because
I'm just trying to say

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.720
well why would they be affectionate?

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.800
Because they have a relationship with you.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:12.780
They're familiar presumably so, yes.

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:14.970
I mean the answer would be of course

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:17.840
they will notice the difference

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:21.350
if there is a difference to be noted.

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:23.530
But I still think it's a big,

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:25.870
you know then you have to
notice that they're noticing,

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:27.340
which is a hard thing for us to do

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:29.350
given that we live among dogs

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:31.790
and we notice very
little of their behavior,

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:32.990
as far as I'm concerned,

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:35.490
in the ordinary course.

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:37.530
We're not really looking
and trying to understand

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:39.580
what they're doing by watching them.

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:42.270
We're kind of putting
an understanding on them

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:43.810
and then assuming they live up to it.

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:46.942
So I don't think we would
notice their noticing.

00:39:46.942 --> 00:39:51.942
- Interestingly, these
olfactory sensibilities,

00:39:54.955 --> 00:39:57.650
obviously they must apply to other dogs,

00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:59.160
not just to humans.

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:04.160
So this is sort of key
to their ability to play.

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:09.510
Choosing their playmates to the extent

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:11.080
that they're not chosen for them.

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.060
Is that correct?

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:16.930
Yeah, so this sensibility
is at work and play.

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:19.970
- Sure, I think in any social
interaction with other dogs,

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:23.460
right, in determining how if
it's a competitive scenario,

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:26.950
and there's food or
attention being doled out,

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:30.800
you could use information
about the health or age

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.430
of another dog to make a decision

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:34.070
about whether you're stronger,

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:36.770
or more likely to get that attention,

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:40.460
or if this is a good well
matched playmate, and so forth.

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:45.460
- You compare the dog
to their wolf ancestors,

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:50.590
and you discern a difference
in the intelligence,

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:54.623
or the kind of intelligence
that a dog has.

00:40:55.716 --> 00:40:59.720
I think you say wolves are
better at working at puzzles,

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:02.290
whereas the dog is more

00:41:04.015 --> 00:41:09.015
a creature that relates to
the other to get information.

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:11.250
Talk a little about that,

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:14.970
because this is a,

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:17.340
and I think you then
also discussed the notion

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:20.890
of working on objects, basically.

00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:22.183
Talk a little about that.

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:26.260
How to use their senses to
deal with their environment

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:28.313
beyond just being an observer of it.

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:31.730
- There are a lot of types
of tasks that would be

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:33.630
put to a dog or any other animal

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:36.170
in a comparative psychology approach.

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:37.310
And there's a lot of research.

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:39.800
This is not my research
but research of others.

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:43.080
Looking at really their
physical cognition skills,

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.080
which would be kind of
the problem solving skills

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:45.913
for the most part,

00:41:45.913 --> 00:41:47.170
and then social cognition skills

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:51.630
which would be problem solving
that involves individuals.

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:54.680
And so wolves and dogs put to the same

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:58.630
physical cognition tasks
performed quite differently,

00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:01.234
with wolves usually surpassing dogs

00:42:01.234 --> 00:42:03.730
if you wanna talk about
who's the better performer.

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:08.680
So a nice test is a kind
of impossible box task

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:13.370
where let's say there's a piece of rope

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:16.830
that's attached to meat
that's secreted inside a box,

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:20.420
and the animal has to
learn to pull the rope

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:21.253
and get the meat.

00:42:21.253 --> 00:42:22.450
And both wolves and dogs can do this,

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:24.530
but then if it's impossible to open,

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:26.680
they pull it and can't get the box open,

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:28.730
it's really well fastened,

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:31.230
the wolf will really go at that task.

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:32.770
And they will figure out a way

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:35.510
or they will die trying, essentially,

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:37.130
to get inside.

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:38.300
They're intent on it.

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:42.820
And a dog, alternately,
will go at it a little bit

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:44.280
and then usually, typically,

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:48.083
the average dog if there
was such a thing, gives up.

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:50.990
And then they do something
very interesting,

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:52.890
which is the social cognitive part.

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:55.660
Which is to say they look to the person,

00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:58.340
who incidentally is the one almost always

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:01.510
solving problems for dogs.

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:05.446
If my dog wants to have food,

00:43:05.446 --> 00:43:08.050
she doesn't go forage for food

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:09.370
or try to discover it on her own,

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:11.130
she just comes to me,

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:14.960
and voila, I am the one who
solves that problem every time.

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:17.070
And so dogs seem to be very good

00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:21.690
at using us as a kind of
tool to solve any problem.

00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:25.040
But they're sort of failing
the physical cognition test.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.440
So that's an interesting reason maybe

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.680
some comparative psychology methods,

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.260
and the answers you
traditionally say they give

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:33.869
don't work as well for dogs.

00:43:33.869 --> 00:43:35.680
They failed the task,

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.630
but they've also really succeeded

00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:39.900
because they've got a much better tool.

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:41.570
They don't have to go
at that until they die,

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:43.830
they can just pester the person

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:46.830
and the person is probably gonna
help them solve the puzzle.

00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:49.610
And so then that's the
social cognition part,

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:52.100
and they perform much better than wolves.

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:56.270
One of the methodologies
that has for some reason

00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:57.793
really hit it off,

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:00.690
and a lot of different researchers

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:02.540
in this field have studied,

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:06.750
is like dog's success at
following points, or gaze.

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:08.810
And they're very good at that,

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:11.510
much, much better than
wolves for the most part,

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:13.937
unless wolves have lived among humans,

00:44:13.937 --> 00:44:16.650
and even better than chimps.

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:18.970
So better than our closest relatives.

00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:20.330
And that seems so automatic, right?

00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:22.980
You point someplace and
the dog kind of knows

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:23.920
that that's something there.

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.862
But a chimp when you point,

00:44:25.862 --> 00:44:28.510
they'll look at the end of your finger,

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:31.270
not at the place which humans say

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:32.670
we're obviously intending,

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:34.080
that place over there on the floor,

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:37.603
not this thing that I'm
using as information.

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:41.150
And dogs seem to get this very early on

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:43.140
given the right development.

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:45.210
And so that's an interesting skill

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:49.480
that allows them to get
information from us.

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.463
They can follow our gaze this way,

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:53.770
and it also means they're looking

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:55.150
at our faces a lot,

00:44:55.150 --> 00:45:00.030
which incidentally I think
is greatly implicated

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:02.490
in our human feelings,

00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:04.060
that dogs really understand us,

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:05.830
that we're really in a
conversation together,

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:07.940
because guess what, they just look at us.

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:10.250
I think they're probably
smelling more than looking,

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:12.020
but they're directed toward us

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:14.410
just as in a conversation.

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:16.900
So they really succeed at
social cognitive tasks,

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:19.460
and the wolves are less good at that.

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:22.273
Probably because they're less trained at,

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:26.113
less driven to look at a face.

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:28.473
- Which they don't do, you say.

00:45:28.473 --> 00:45:29.910
- But they don't typically do that

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:31.440
if they're not exposed to humans.

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:35.560
Eye contact, prolonged eye contact

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:36.568
would not be tolerated.

00:45:36.568 --> 00:45:39.724
That's really a threat, not,

00:45:39.724 --> 00:45:40.960
you know you wouldn't
want to go up to a wolf

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:41.962
and just stare at them.

00:45:41.962 --> 00:45:44.690
The same with a dog you
don't know, for instance,

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:46.200
but the dog you do know,

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.500
you might just sit there
and gaze at each other,

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:51.150
and that really feels like it's the basis

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:52.040
for an understanding,

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.240
and other animals don't do that.

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.020
They use gaze as threat.

00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:58.850
So wolves won't really look us in the face

00:45:58.850 --> 00:45:59.880
for a long period,

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:01.550
they're not getting
information from our gaze

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:02.410
and from our points,

00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:04.470
and so they're gonna fail at those

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:06.950
social cognitive tasks relative to dogs.

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:11.950
- So what you're describing
is a real justification

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:14.470
for your point of the book

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:17.960
which is to get into
the umwelt of the dog,

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:22.960
because if you were doing
intelligence testing,

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.680
you might conclude,
well the dog is a dummy.

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.230
But what you're saying is no,

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:30.160
you gotta look at the context which is

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:32.510
that they are a social animal,

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:37.510
whereas a wolf is really only
social within its own pack.

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:42.216
- Yeah, they're so social with us,

00:46:42.216 --> 00:46:44.793
and that's their real skill.

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:49.680
And I think understanding
the dog's perspective there

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:52.230
is that the dog's social world

00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:54.876
has extended to include the human.

00:46:54.876 --> 00:46:56.703
And that's quite a skill.

00:46:57.854 --> 00:47:02.854
- You look at this relationship
between humans and dogs,

00:47:05.173 --> 00:47:09.790
and it's almost a marriage made in heaven,

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:10.623
so to speak,

00:47:10.623 --> 00:47:14.873
and you talk about things that we,

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:19.920
the commonality that leads
us to meet each other

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:23.690
in this relationship.

00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:25.660
And one is contact, right?

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:28.810
In other words, both humans and dogs

00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:31.380
like to be touched, basically.

00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:33.800
- Yeah, and I think that touch is

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:36.083
affiliative, it's affectionate.

00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:40.900
And dogs kind of suffer
being touched by us.

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:42.450
I mean they like to be touched.

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:45.820
Wolves, their relations
would sleep together,

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:47.770
and on top of each other and so forth,

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:49.400
but also dogs will seem to endure

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.620
all sorts of types of touching from us.

00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:54.780
Regardless of if we're
family members or not.

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:58.650
And that's very appealing.

00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:01.230
If you looked just anthropologically,

00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:04.420
if you watched people go by a pet store

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:07.560
and how they interacted
with the inhabitants

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.700
of that pet store who they'd never met,

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:12.100
most people wanna touch the animal, right,

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:13.900
that's very important for us.

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:15.230
And dogs will allow that,

00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:18.960
that's part of their way of
interacting with each other.

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:23.130
- And there's a kind of
a mutual signaling which,

00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:25.780
I guess you're saying the
dog originally got that

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:28.870
from the wolves returning to the pack.

00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:32.310
But they've sort of crossed species

00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:35.760
and so this whole greeting thing

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.820
is a big deal in the relationship.

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:40.930
- Yeah, so when a hunting dog returns

00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:44.393
to his or her pack, and has made a kill,

00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:48.010
they really are mobbed
by their pack members,

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:49.080
there is a big greeting.

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:51.190
And it is a greeting, it's very exciting.

00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:53.020
And they do all this
licking around the face

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:54.100
of the returning hunter,

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:57.480
and that prompts the hunter to regurgitate

00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:00.610
some of the food to share with everybody.

00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:04.370
And it's so interesting
to see that same behavior

00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:07.620
within human homes, where you have,

00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:10.700
we return and our dog
comes and jumps at us

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:11.800
and licks at our face,

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:13.570
and it is just a greeting to us.

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:15.430
In fact we call it a kiss.

00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:18.348
A dog licks your face, people
call it kissing or something.

00:49:18.348 --> 00:49:21.550
And so that's the end
of our definition of it.

00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:24.060
And I think it's interesting
to go back one step

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:26.930
and say, oh right,
usually the returning dog

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:31.210
would have regurgitated some
of the food to everybody.

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:33.090
And we rarely do that.

00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:34.940
I don't know that the dog
would be unhappy if we did.

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:37.920
But so I think it is a greeting,

00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.180
but you get some more knowledge

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:41.180
about the history of that greeting

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:42.907
from looking at their ancestors.

00:49:42.907 --> 00:49:44.640
- And when this licking when you

00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.052
come back from a restaurant,

00:49:46.052 --> 00:49:49.720
they're gathering information.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:51.650
I mean they're not yet ready to say,

00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:54.417
oh you went to Che Panice for dinner

00:49:54.417 --> 00:49:55.890
and you left me here.

00:49:55.890 --> 00:50:00.840
But in other words, they
are absorbing information.

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:04.010
Is that information useful for them,

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:06.760
or does it just give them security

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:09.550
to input this information?

00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:11.180
- Well, I mean look at it this way.

00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:14.160
If we have information that
we've been eating something,

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:17.090
and the origin of this licking was

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:19.270
to provoke sharing of that eating,

00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:23.520
then the smell would prompt them to do

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:27.850
more and more of it to
try to, as a request,

00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:29.780
to try to get us to share it with them.

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.520
So it's informative in that way.

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:33.887
I don't think they put it in the bank,

00:50:33.887 --> 00:50:35.187
"And she went out every night,

00:50:35.187 --> 00:50:36.737
"and she had pizza five times,

00:50:36.737 --> 00:50:38.769
"and then she had Chinese food."

00:50:38.769 --> 00:50:43.769
But certainly it would've been
useful to get information.

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.270
Yeah, and so all the smelling.

00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:48.690
Think of all the smells we must pick up.

00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:50.560
Not just of other dogs as it were,

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:52.040
that we might've touched in the world,

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:54.740
but just smells that are
hitting us from the world

00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:56.460
as we travel through our environments

00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:58.670
which that dog's nose is sensitive to.

00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:01.710
That's information for them about,

00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:04.200
in some way about where we've been,

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:05.790
or who we've been interacting with.

00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:09.070
And it is, I think, interesting to them.

00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:12.090
- And finally, you emphasize the timing

00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:14.680
of the relationship, that in other words,

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:17.930
which is about what?

00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:21.003
- Well for instance, there
is a lot of turn taking.

00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:26.642
And mutual looking, and
checking back, and looking away,

00:51:26.642 --> 00:51:29.170
between dog and human,

00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:31.890
which is very reminiscent of how humans

00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:34.350
deal with each other in conversation,

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:36.500
there's some very nice
studies showing that

00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:42.200
the sort of bouncing
back and forth of actions

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:44.750
between, or gaze between dog and human

00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:49.750
is very similar to flirting,
mixed sex strangers

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.842
behaviors between each other.

00:51:51.842 --> 00:51:55.650
So they're doing something
in interaction with us,

00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:57.280
even without words,

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.860
even without the same understanding.

00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:00.210
Which is familiar to us,

00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:02.960
which is just appealing to us

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:06.070
and fits into our model of
how you deal with others.

00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:09.423
And so we slip them right
into that category of others.

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:13.010
- When we started you mentioned the fact

00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:18.010
that you were someone who had
had companionship with dogs,

00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:19.400
I won't use the word owner.

00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:22.430
And so I'm curious now
to look back and ask

00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:26.724
how you, as a dog person,
has informed your science,

00:52:26.724 --> 00:52:31.724
and how your science has
informed you as a dog person.

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:35.323
- Hmm.

00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:41.150
I think living with
dogs informed my science

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:43.480
by changing the types of questions I ask.

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:46.830
I'm very interested in
the fact that we have

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:50.640
an entire vocabulary,
people who live with dogs

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:53.880
have an entire vocabulary
to describe their dogs,

00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:56.800
you know right from very early
on living with their dogs,

00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.780
these anthropomorphisms we put on the dogs

00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:00.560
about their understanding,
and what they think, and why,

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.420
and what they think of us.

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:03.960
And that functions pretty well, actually.

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:06.030
It might not be right, it might be right,

00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:07.550
but it just functions pretty well

00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:10.810
for the entirety of that
dogs life with that person.

00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:14.680
And those aren't the types of questions

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:18.340
that comparative psychology usually asks.

00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:20.510
They ask, do you follow a point?

00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:22.480
Or as I did in approach,

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:24.810
does the dog have a
kind of theory of mind,

00:53:24.810 --> 00:53:26.340
or a rudimentary theory of mind?

00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:28.060
And I think those are
interesting questions but

00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:31.990
I've moved away from those a little bit,

00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:34.360
and I'm asking more the types of questions

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:38.880
about whether those words
that we use to describe dogs

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:41.920
when we're living with dogs are correct,

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.340
or if there's a better explanation,

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:44.580
or is there something where we can get

00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:47.340
a better understanding of the
dog by using different words.

00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:50.690
And so I think that's
what living with dogs

00:53:50.690 --> 00:53:52.520
has done to my science.

00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:54.810
My science, what the science has done

00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:57.010
with my living with dogs has I think

00:53:57.010 --> 00:53:59.750
made me a much better owner.

00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:01.550
And I will use that word,
it's just a convenient word,

00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:04.130
but I don't think of myself
as owning dogs per se.

00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:08.083
It just explains that relationship.

00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:12.320
I've become a much better observer.

00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:14.020
I think I've become a much better,

00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:18.897
much more conscientious
person living with dogs,

00:54:18.897 --> 00:54:21.090
and much more sensitive to what the

00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:25.150
dog might need, or desire, or want,

00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:26.410
or what the dog is telling me.

00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:29.010
So gee, now I understand when the dog is

00:54:29.010 --> 00:54:30.310
trying to get my attention

00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:34.730
for something important that they need.

00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:36.960
The very few things they ask of us, food,

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:41.410
or going outside, or
interaction, much earlier.

00:54:41.410 --> 00:54:45.840
So I can kind of change the
way a dog gets your attention,

00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:47.210
instead of having to ramp it up

00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:50.340
until they're barking at
you, and annoying you,

00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:51.880
you can see when they just come

00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:55.263
and touch your knee with
their nose as a request,

00:54:56.110 --> 00:54:58.180
and see yeah, you're
communicating with me,

00:54:58.180 --> 00:54:59.580
I'm gonna see what you want.

00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:03.350
That's very satisfying.

00:55:03.350 --> 00:55:05.870
The dog is, if you're seeing
what the dog is saying,

00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:06.960
that's very satisfying.

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:09.500
And I also am much more appreciative

00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:12.780
of letting my dogs smell the world.

00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:15.920
So we have, I describe in my book,

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.810
the smell walks we take,

00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:20.900
where this whole predefined interaction

00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:22.390
that we have with dogs where we're gonna

00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:23.523
take them for a walk.

00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.863
Everyone knows if you're gonna have a dog

00:55:25.863 --> 00:55:27.740
you're have to take them for walks, right?

00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:29.660
And mostly that's about elimination,

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:30.950
and maybe it's about exercise,

00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:35.950
but lets say you're a dog who's
inside for 20 hours a day,

00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:40.000
with maybe nobody to deal
with for most of that

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.783
because the people you
live with are working.

00:55:44.362 --> 00:55:45.400
What would be great?

00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:46.233
Going for a walk.

00:55:46.233 --> 00:55:47.066
Why?

00:55:47.066 --> 00:55:49.020
Not just so that you can urinate,

00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:51.740
but also to see other dogs
which is very important,

00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:53.830
I think everyone agrees on that.

00:55:53.830 --> 00:55:56.300
But also you can smell
what the world is like.

00:55:56.300 --> 00:56:00.280
So what if we took walks where every time

00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:01.460
they wanted to stop and smell,

00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:04.540
and we're pulling at
their leashes to come on,

00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:06.270
hurry up, we have to take a walk.

00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:08.940
You know, we realize that's their walk.

00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:10.812
They're walking, this is
what the experience is,

00:56:10.812 --> 00:56:14.070
and letting them enjoy that,

00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:15.750
or experience it, whatever it is.

00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:18.020
And I love that now.

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:20.450
I love seeing my dogs do that.

00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:25.450
And letting them live out
of their noses a little bit.

00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:27.520
So that's, and that's only since really

00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:29.340
I started studying dogs that I did that.

00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:30.810
I didn't know that ahead of time.

00:56:30.810 --> 00:56:34.160
It was only through
reflecting on their capacity

00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:35.330
that I realized I should change

00:56:35.330 --> 00:56:38.340
my way of walking my dog.

00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:40.932
- Well one of the themes in this book,

00:56:40.932 --> 00:56:45.293
and in your new book on, I can't remember,

00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:49.680
On Looking, is you have a very strong

00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:52.123
interest in attention, right?

00:56:53.130 --> 00:56:55.800
I think you say in that second book

00:56:55.800 --> 00:57:00.333
that our environment really
makes us unattentive,

00:57:01.518 --> 00:57:04.760
and part of what you're interested in

00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:09.760
is how do we re-aim that
attention, and so on.

00:57:11.330 --> 00:57:14.870
Talk a little about that
because it's clearly a theme

00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:18.100
in the focus that you have on cognition.

00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:18.937
- Yeah, I think you're right.

00:57:18.937 --> 00:57:22.733
And I wouldn't, in cognition
attention is a whole specialty.

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:25.730
And I never was drawn to that.

00:57:25.730 --> 00:57:29.583
So I think it's a different
type of meaning of attention.

00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:32.532
Now that you mention it,

00:57:32.532 --> 00:57:37.480
what it is is an interest in
looking in a different way

00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:40.330
at something which is familiar.

00:57:40.330 --> 00:57:42.880
You know in some sense that
is a connection between

00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:47.310
my recent writing and my
research in writing about dogs,

00:57:47.310 --> 00:57:49.620
is there is a very familiar thing.

00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:50.700
We already know about it.

00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:52.180
You know maybe some people didn't,

00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:53.760
psychology didn't even think that the dog

00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:54.900
was worth studying cognitively,

00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:55.943
as we already know.

00:57:57.260 --> 00:58:01.270
And now here's an ordinary
block in the city,

00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:05.080
which is a walk I took again
and again for On Looking.

00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:06.280
We already know what's on the walk,

00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:07.620
so we don't need to look.

00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:10.220
And so we've lost a type of attention

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:15.220
to object or scene which
actually has a lot of levels

00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:20.703
of richness that we could notice.

00:58:21.836 --> 00:58:24.010
As opposed to being attracted
to the exotic, I think,

00:58:24.010 --> 00:58:25.930
I'm kind of attracted to getting

00:58:25.930 --> 00:58:28.340
different perspectives on the ordinary.

00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:32.050
And so that's the attention
I'm interested in bringing,

00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:35.490
like a new way of looking
at something familiar.

00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:39.153
- And so dogs were a good
field of study for you.

00:58:39.153 --> 00:58:40.739
- I think so, accidentally.

00:58:40.739 --> 00:58:42.360
- Because you say they're anthropologists

00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:44.540
of us in their world.

00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:47.240
- Yeah right, and they'll looking at us

00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:48.073
in an interesting way.

00:58:48.073 --> 00:58:50.640
I really admire how well they look at us

00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:52.186
and observe our behavior.

00:58:52.186 --> 00:58:56.670
- Well, Alexandra this
has been a fascinating

00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:59.020
conversion, let me show your book again,

00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:01.420
'cause I think it's a great read,

00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:04.710
and people are gonna want to
come to it for that reason

00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:07.250
but also because of
their interest in dogs.

00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:09.328
Thank you very much for
coming on our program.

00:59:09.328 --> 00:59:10.161
- Thanks Harry.

00:59:10.161 --> 00:59:10.994
- Thank you.

00:59:10.994 --> 00:59:13.140
And thank you very much for joining us

00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:15.554
for this Conversation with History.

00:59:15.554 --> 00:59:18.721
