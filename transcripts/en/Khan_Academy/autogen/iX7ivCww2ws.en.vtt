00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.590
 Not long ago we had dealt with the roots we had 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.370
 We only used the square root 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.190
 We saw that if you typed the root code so and put it 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.180
 Underneath 9, this means I want the square root of 9 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.690
 It is positive 3 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.880
 Or can tell the positive square root for 9 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.840
 What is the implicit concept of this is that I want 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.360
 Take the square root 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.670
 I can write it like this 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.640
 You can type the root code so and so 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.040
 The 2 is here, which also means the square root 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.570
 Square root of number 9 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.680
 Find a number if you square it 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.130
 I'll get 9 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.330
 The root code does not 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.750
 Apply only in the case of square root 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.210
 It can change the value under the root and take 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.660
 Root any number 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.390
 For example, if you want to ask you, how much - you can 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.040
 Imagine what is called cubism root, or can be called 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.780
 The third root of 27 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.980
 how much? 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.120
 Well, it 's any number that raises the power to 3 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.910
 I get 27 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.420
 Well, the only number that if raised to force 3 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.540
 I'll get 27 is 3 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.420
 3 × 3 × 3 = 27 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.040
 Ie 9 × 3 = 27 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.720
 If anyone else asks me 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.760
 If we had 16 - I would do this in a different color 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.780
 If we have 16 I want to find its quadrilateral root 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.840
 What is the number that if I hit it myself 4 times I will get 16? 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.030
 If you do not realize this quickly, you can 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.920
 To analyze 16 factors 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.250
 So you find him 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.440
 To see it 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.830
 16 = 2 × 8 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.120
 8 is 2 × 4 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.340
 And 4 is 2 × 2 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.010
 That is, this equals the quadratic root of 2 x 2 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.910
 × 2 × 2 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.510
 We have four of the number 2 here 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.450
 Well, we have four of the number 2 multiplied by each other, if the quadrant root 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.039
 It will be 2 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.750
 This can be reviewed on it 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.750
 The quadruple root because it is all-2 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.100
 You will succeed as well 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.890
 . 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.360
 Just as you hit square roots, you should 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.540
 Hit the four roots 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.020
 But the root symbol means the root 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.530
 Thus, we have spread 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.510
 Traditional square roots 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.940
 I wish now that you can simplify the roots 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.155
 Carrying higher root forces 

00:02:38.155 --> 00:02:39.980
 So let's try several examples 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.790
 Let me say I want to simplify this phrase 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.140
 Root V for 96 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.860
 As I said earlier, let's analyze the value of its factors 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.080
 If 96 is 2 x 48 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.000
 And 48 = 2 x 24 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.640
 24 is 2 × 12 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.160
 And 12 = 2 x 6 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.970
 And 6 are 2 × 3 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.790
 If the fifth root equals 2 × 2 × 2 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.040
 2 × 2 × 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.090
 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.310
 X 3 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.520
 Or in another way, can be written on a picture 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.540
 Fractional forces 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.540
 They can be considered as fractional powers 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.720
 We have already talked about this 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.980
 It is equal to 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.780
 2 x 3 ^ 1/5 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.330
 Let me clarify this 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.270
 If we want to extract the root n for a number, it will be equal to taking 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.560
 This number is 1 / n 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.510
 These words are equal 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.640
 If we take this number to force 1/5, then this 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.220
 Same as 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.640
 X 2 ^ 1/5 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.150
 X 3 ^ 1/5 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.760
 I now have numbers multiplied by each other 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.630
 I have 2 multiplied by herself 5 times 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.280
 I raised it to force 1/5 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.180
 Well, power 1/5 equals 2 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.570
 Or that the fifth root will equal 2 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.220
 If we have 2 here 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.899
 This will be 3 ^ 1/5 

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:26.860
 (2 x 3) ^ 1/5 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.750
 You can also simplify them 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.790
 But if we want to keep it root, we can write it 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:39.020
 So: 2 x root v for 3 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.270
 Let us try another question 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.320
 We will try another matter 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.480
 I will use the variables now 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:53.850
 To transfer we want to simplify the sixth root of 64 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.570
 X x ^ 8 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.420
 Let's begin with 64 first 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:06.230
 64 = 2 × 32 and 32 × 2 × 16 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.980
 16 is 2 × 8 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.610
 And 8 are 2 × 4 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.860
 And 4 = 2 x 2 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.730
 If we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.900
 We have 2 ^ 6 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.880
 Ie the value is equal to the sixth root of 2 ^ 6 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:28.530
 This is the 64-x x ^ 8 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.500
 Now, the sixth root for 2 ^ 6 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.140
 direct 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:39.290
 This part will equal 2 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:47.460
 It will be 2 x x root 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.710
 For x ^ 8 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.230
 x ^ 8 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.300
 How can this be simplified? 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.310
 Well, x ^ 8, equals x ^ 6 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.860
 X x ^ 2 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.630
 We have the same foundation, so we gather the foundations 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.050
 Which equals x ^ 8 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.960
 This equals 2 x x root for x ^ 6 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.940
 X x ^ 2 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.500
 The sixth root, this part, the sixth root 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.770
 For x ^ 6, is x 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.270
 If this equals 2 × x × 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.900
 The sixth root of x ^ 2 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.810
 Now, we can simplify these more if 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:34.570
 I thought about it 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.990
 Remember, that phrase 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:44.130
 Equivalent (x ^ 2) ^ 1/6 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.100
 And if you remember the properties of the foundations, when it is 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.620
 Raises the number of a certain amount, and then raises the whole amount 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.800
 For another, Vesaisoui 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.490
 x ^ 2 × 1/6 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.720
 Or - let me write this - 2 x 1/6, 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.010
 Equally - I should not forget that I have 2x here 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.080
 If I have 2x here and 2x here 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.300
 It is the same as 2x 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.810
 X x ^ 2/6 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.220
 Or, if we want to write it simpler or less 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:26.710
 Common, we get 2x × x ^ - what we have 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.870
 Here? x ^ 1/3 

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.320
 If you want to type it root, you can type it 

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:38.180
 So: 2 × 2x × the third root of x 

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.720
 Or think of it in another way, you could say-- 

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.650
 If we can move from this point 

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:47.580
 We can write this 

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.190
 We can ignore this, as we did before 

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:53.120
 Can say, that this equals 2 × 

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.090
 (x ^ 8) ^ 1/6 

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.650
 (x ^ 8) ^ 1/6 

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:03.570
 This is equal to 2 × x ^ 

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.710
 8 x 1/6 - x ^ 8/6 

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.360
 Now we can do a shortcut to break 

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.780
 The amount becomes 2 × x ^ 4/3 

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.610
 This and that are equal 

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:18.660
 Why? 

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.530
 Because we have 2 x x or 2 x x ^ 1 

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:24.320
 X x ^ 1/3 

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.470
 Add 1 to 1/3, get 4/3 

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:31.350
 I hope you found this lesson 

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:32.585
 Pleasing 

00:08:32.585 --> 00:08:35.570
 I think it is useful and you will find it in the main factor 

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.640
 If you want to find the root of vi, it will be on 

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.330
 Find a basic factor that is repeated six times 

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.210
 And then I can find a value of 2 ^ 6 

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:45.600
 Anyway, I hope you found this explanation useful
