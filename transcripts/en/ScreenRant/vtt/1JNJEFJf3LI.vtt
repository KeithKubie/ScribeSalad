00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.730
Hit films can begin in the most unlikely places,
but when director James Cameron dreamed of

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.860
a knife-wielding steel skeleton crawling through
flames, he could never have guessed how successful

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.560
his �Terminator� would become.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.410
Its sequel would be just the first time Cameron
would redefine blockbuster filmmaking, but

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.510
even devoted fans may not realize just how
strange the franchise�s earliest days really

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.510
were.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.340
Here are Screen Rant�s 10 things You Need
to Know About the Terminator.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.290
Cameron�s Cameos

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.540
Director James Cameron has made a career of
large-scale movies, but he�s just as well

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.540
known for his personal touches.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.250
Specifically, lending his voice to a number
of easy-to-miss off-screen roles.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.400
In The Terminator, Cameron�s voice can be
heard cancelling a date on Sarah�s answering

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:57.490
machine, and as the Tiki Motel receptionist.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.460
In the sequel, Terminator 2: Judgment Day,
Cameron has a much more� horrifying role:

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.430
voicing the death shrieks of the T-1000.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.650
Biehn�s Bad Luck

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.689
The Terminator marked the first of several
collaborations between James Cameron and Michael

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.119
Biehn, cementing the young actor as one of
the most unforgettable sci-fi stars on the

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.130
�80s and �90s - and creating a strange
running joke in the process.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.030
Cameron would make sure the actor paid a price
for his starring roles, having his characters

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.079
bitten on the hand in all three of their films:
as Kyle Reese in The Terminator, Corporal

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.350
Hicks in Aliens and The Abyss.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.210
Cameron originally planned on casting Biehn
in his 3D hit Avatar, so we have to assume

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.460
he had a set of alien teeth with the actor�s
name on it.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.049
I�ll Be Back

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.090
It�s hard for modern fans to believe that
the success of the Terminator series was ever

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.259
in doubt � even harder to think that the
iconic tagline �I�ll be back� was just

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.259
as uncertain.

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.829
Surprisingly, star Arnold Schwarzenegger didn�t
like the sound of the line, believing a robotic

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.310
killer would pronounce it in proper English,
as �I will be back.� In the end, James

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.780
Cameron insisted that HE was the writer, and
Arnold was proven wrong.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.610
The line became an instant hit, following
him throughout his entire movie career.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.800
Bug Spray

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.313
Plenty of movie magic went into making the
film, but not every extra touch in the film

00:02:21.313 --> 00:02:24.250
was planned ahead of time � or healthy for
the cast and crew.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.250
When Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor emerge into
the fog after hiding out under a bridge, the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.110
fog isn�t real � but it isn�t fake,
either.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.390
The film�s production took place during
insecticide spraying for a fruit fly outbreak

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.010
in the Los Angeles area.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.530
The filmmakers had planned to wait for the
clouds to clear, but decided to use the added

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.530
effect instead.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.070
Looks like a robot wasn�t the only thing
trying to kill them.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.870
Guerrilla Filmmaking

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.150
Terminator may be a billion-dollar property
these days, but the first film was a different

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.150
story.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.070
The Terminator first revealing his stolen
�biker� outfit and punching through a

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.840
car window is hard to forget.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.590
But the lengthy shot was actually the last
to be completed, with James Cameron footing

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.050
the bill for the 2 hour shoot himself.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.870
Since he had no permit to be filming on the
street, only he and Arnold Schwarzenegger

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.430
were present, with the actor�s street clothes
stashed behind the car in case a police officer

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.180
stumbled upon them.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.480
Writer�s Block

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.720
James Cameron can�t claim all the filmmaker
cameos for himself, with his friend and writing

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.960
partner William Wisher, Jr. making a brief
appearance as the police officer who is knocked

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.970
out and carjacked by the Terminator after
his first fight Wisher would also return for

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.111
the sequel, in which he cameos as a shutterbug
shopper, and later as a TV reporter in The

00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:33.111
Abyss.

00:03:33.111 --> 00:03:34.111
Wolfie

00:03:34.111 --> 00:03:37.160
It isn�t just humans who make up the core
cast of the Terminator series.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.010
In the sequel, the shape-shifting T-1000 attempts
to lure John Connor home by copying the voice

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.290
of his foster mother, but the trap is foiled
when John�s guardian Terminator uses the

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.680
wrong name for the family�s dog.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.180
The name �Wolfie� wasn�t random, but
James Cameron�s nickname for his own German

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.350
Shepard, �Beowulf,� who appeared in the
first movie.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.060
Wolfie would return as �Max� in the final
scene.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.720
Hopefully he got a raise for the sequel.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.720
Twins

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.020
Terminator 2 is credited with pushing special
effects even farther than its predecessor,

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.500
but not every effect was so �special.�
Instead of struggling with split-screen when

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.440
it came to the T-1000�s shape-shifting,
Cameron let nature do the work, casting twins

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.199
to play a security guard and his robotic doppelganger.

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:24.100
The trick reappears in the movie�s climax,
calling on Linda Hamilton�s identical twin

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.319
sister Leslie, but it�s not the most clever
one.

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:29.840
When the Terminator�s brain is opened up
in front of a mirror earlier in the film,

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.819
viewers are actually looking at Arnold Schwarzenegger
and Leslie through a hole in the wall, as

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:38.090
his castmates operate on a dummy.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.129
Low Flyer

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:45.460
Relying on practical effects may be easier,
but it�s not always safer.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.080
Modern audiences may look at the helicopter
chase scene of T2 and assume some special

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.310
effects were responsible.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.740
Particularly the shot of a helicopter flying
under an overpass with little room to spare.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.849
While a chopper was suspended on a crane for
close-ups, the pilot told James Cameron he

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:00.710
could pull off the stunt for real.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.080
Having seen his mastery of the machine already
� narrowly missing another overpass in the

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.080
same chase � the director agreed.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.090
The camera crew called the stunt too dangerous
and refused, leaving only Cameron and his

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.509
driver to witness it firsthand.

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:15.900
Audiences, however, can enjoy it for all time.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.900
The Launch of a Universe

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.479
The Terminator became a hit series, but fans
may not realize that long before shared universes

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:25.509
were all the rage, James Cameron had crafted
his own.

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:29.749
It began with the Terminator, as one LA news
anchor would reappear to cover a hurricane

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:32.520
in Cameron�s underwater alien adventure,
The Abyss.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.879
That film�s cast is employed by the oil
company Benthic Petroleum whose logo can also

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:39.530
be seen at the gas station John and Sarah
visit in T2.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.500
It wouldn�t stop there, as one frantic reporter
would reprise his role in True Lies.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.639
Cameron clearly had a few favorite actors
on standby, but the end result is a single

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.870
universe of blockbuster hits.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.400
So what do you think of our list?

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.810
Are there any bits of trivia or easter eggs
that you think are essential for Terminator

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:58.810
