00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.500
CATHY DAW: Datastax
delivers Apache Cassandra

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.850
to the enterprise.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.230
Apache Cassandra is the
leading distributed database

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.760
that is built to be
agile, always on,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.090
and predictably scalable.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.630
We have around 30
software engineers

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.430
that are testing our product.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.110
And they're testing
clusters of different sizes.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.740
RUSSELL SPITZER: We call
up clusters and then run

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.770
a series of tests,
simulate these events,

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.729
and then we actually take
the entire clusters down.

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:32.770
CATHY DAW: When we started
looking at other Cloud

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.500
providers, one of the
challenges that we ran into

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.970
was that we would
always be asked,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.136
well can you tell us exactly
what you're going to do

00:00:40.136 --> 00:00:41.710
and when you're going to do it?

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.910
Google has a very
flexible cost model

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.690
that allowed us to not
have to think or plan.

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:50.470
RUSSELL SPITZER: One of my
favorite things about Google

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.570
Compute Engine is that
any calls that you

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.590
do in the UI can instantly be
translated into a REST call.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.891
If we were launching a
particularly large set

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:00.390
of instances and
we know they're all

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.070
going to be configured
in a similar way,

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.019
the GC API makes
that really simple.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.260
We have one set-up image
and then suddenly we'll

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.225
have 1,000 machines
that all look identical,

00:01:09.225 --> 00:01:10.936
and it takes almost no time.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.680
CATHY DAW: Google has been a
great company to work with.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.420
We've gotten a lot of support
from our account executive who

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.430
took the time to understand
our multiple use cases.

00:01:23.155 --> 00:01:24.780
RUSSELL SPITZER: It's
not a simple task

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.465
to set up a framework for
launching clusters and taking

00:01:27.465 --> 00:01:29.010
them down and
installing products,

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.160
but Google was really
helpful and actually gave us

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
a lot of great ideas on how
to really efficiently launch

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.220
large numbers of machines
at the same time.

00:01:37.516 --> 00:01:40.970
CATHY DAW: We didn't want
to constrain our engineers.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.870
We wanted to enable
them to throw

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.280
what they can at the product,
to do the best that they could.
