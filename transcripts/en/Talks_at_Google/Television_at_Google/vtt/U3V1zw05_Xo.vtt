00:00:07.312 --> 00:00:08.270
GIA MORA: Hi, everyone.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.020
KEVIN GRAZIER: Hi.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.402
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.737 --> 00:00:15.070
GIA MORA: Well, good afternoon
to you here in the studio

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.400
and, of course, to all the
Livestreamers out there.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.770
Welcome to another
wonderful Talk at Google.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.940
My name is Gia Mora.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.130
And I am one third of The
Scirens-- The Screen Scirens

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.140
for Science.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.510
And with me today is
Dr. Kevin Grazier.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.260
KEVIN GRAZIER: Hi.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.180
GIA MORA: Kevin is not only
a PhD In planetary science

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.380
known for his work on the
Cassini-Huygens project

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.460
at NASA, but he's also
a writer, an educator,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.750
a sought after public
speaker, and-- what we're here

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.420
to talk about today-- he is
a science adviser for hit TV

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.090
shows and blockbuster
movies in Hollywood.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.890
Now, that is quite a
list of accomplishments

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.727
for a boy from Sterling
Heights, Michigan, I believe?

00:00:52.727 --> 00:00:53.810
KEVIN GRAZIER: Yeah, yeah.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:54.960
GIA MORA: Is that
what you intended?

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.630
Did you think, oh I'm going to
get a PhD in planetary science

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.860
from UCLA.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.632
I'm going to go
work in Hollywood.

00:01:00.632 --> 00:01:02.090
KEVIN GRAZIER: The
PhD was planned.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.720
The Hollywood thing
came in later.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.950
I literally transferred,
in midstream, PhD programs.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.700
I was actually in a
PhD program in Purdue,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.980
where I had done my
undergrad and Master's.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.210
But I decided to
go to UCLA instead.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.100
Partly because I
wanted to work at JPL.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.370
And it was right across town.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.130
And that worked out pretty well.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.310
But when I discovered
that Hollywood Science

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.600
Advisor is a thing, oh yeah.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.401
I totally wanted to do that.

00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:30.650
So I decided that yeah, that
would be something that I

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.815
think I would enjoy doing.

00:01:31.815 --> 00:01:32.940
But I also wanted to write.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.912
So I was hoping that one
would lead to the other.

00:01:35.912 --> 00:01:36.786
So that was the plan.

00:01:36.786 --> 00:01:37.480
At least initially.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.070
So yeah.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.360
GIA MORA: Great.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.030
So for those of
you who don't know,

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.030
tell us what is a
Hollywood Science Adviser?

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.530
KEVIN GRAZIER: Well,
Science Advisor

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.310
works on science fiction
or science-themed shows.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.571
And we work on getting the
science as right as possible.

00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:52.820
It doesn't have to be perfect.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.310
We're not doing documentaries.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.310
Sometimes perfect science
is not only not a goal,

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.980
it's opposite to some of
the goals you may have.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.980
Sometimes you don't want
to get science perfect.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.813
But you want to get it
as right as possible.

00:02:03.813 --> 00:02:07.000
Because what you want
to do is sell the world.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.699
You want to sell that this
is a well-thought-out world.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.360
And if you throw
some science out

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.780
that's at variance with
the way the world works,

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.360
or with people, how to
understand the world works,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.920
they get what's called an Oh
Please moment, where suddenly,

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.280
rather than being immersed in
your creative vision, they go,

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.490
no.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.030
No, please.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.930
And suddenly, they go
from being immersed

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.310
in the world of
defiance to sitting

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.580
in a room in the 20th century
with four walls, a ceiling

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.430
and a floor, going no.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.860
Just-- you lost me.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.125
And so that's what
we do, is we try

00:02:44.125 --> 00:02:45.750
to get the science
as right as possible

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.540
to minimize the
Oh Please moments.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.120
GIA MORA: OK so in sustaining
the suspension of disbelief,

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.070
you use real science.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.170
Is there any other
ulterior motives,

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.480
as a PhD planetary scientist?

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.721
KEVIN GRAZIER: As far
as ulterior motives,

00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:04.990
even if your science
isn't perfect-- wow,

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.010
that's like a
really good lead in.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.250
Even if your science
isn't perfect,

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.560
if you're working on
a big-budget Hollywood

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.130
show or a feature, you will
get opportunities-- like here

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.180
and now-- to set
the record straight.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.820
If people have
questions-- was this true?

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.410
Or if people will say,
maybe, jump over your science

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.994
in a big-budget 2013 film--

00:03:24.994 --> 00:03:26.660
GIA MORA:
[CLEARING THROAT DELIBERATELY]

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.320
"Gravity".

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.153
KEVIN GRAZIER: Yeah.

00:03:28.153 --> 00:03:28.900
GIA MORA: Yeah.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.775
KEVIN GRAZIER: --then
you get the opportunity

00:03:30.775 --> 00:03:34.025
to do talks, DVD extras,
or write books like oh,

00:03:34.025 --> 00:03:38.970
say, "Hollyweird Science", to
talk about the actual science

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.000
that came into play.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.080
And what you find is oftentimes
some of the complaints

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.750
are non-issues.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.860
Some of the complaints
are, themselves, riddled

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.130
with mistakes.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.340
So again, we're trying
to sell the world,

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.650
trying to minimize the
"oh please" moments.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.510
And that does come
with the benefits

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.260
of being able to help educate
on the real world science.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.760
Absolutely.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.810
GIA MORA: Great.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.268
That was going to
my next question.

00:04:03.268 --> 00:04:05.500
So why should Hollywood care?

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.720
Not the audience, but
why should Hollywood--

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.400
producers, directors,
writers-- why should they

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.640
care about good science
in science fiction

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.899
or in popular culture at
large, in entertainment?

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:19.950
KEVIN GRAZIER: We're getting
a lot better at storytelling

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:20.790
across the board.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.430
And let me use the
example of shows

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.260
I've worked on, like Battlestar
and "Eureka" and "Defiance",

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.060
there was a dedication to
excellence across the board,

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.801
getting created languages
done well was a thing.

00:04:33.801 --> 00:04:35.050
Selling the world was a thing.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.883
And getting the science
as right as possible

00:04:36.883 --> 00:04:39.590
was a desire to do
the best job we can.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.000
But apart from that,
Hollywood cares

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.670
because we have a culture
of the nitpicker now.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.450
If you get something
wrong, guaranteed

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.800
there's going to somebody online
complaining about it-- well,

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.810
it's a film-- the
second the film's over.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.268
Unless, of course,
they're actually

00:04:54.268 --> 00:04:55.430
tweeting from their seat.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.050
And there is that.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.950
So if you get too many
people nitpicking,

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.730
it can ruin your bottom line.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.219
So when "Gravity" started
getting nitpicked,

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:10.510
before the film even came
out, I got calls from Warner,

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.060
saying, hey, could you
talk to this person

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.680
or talk to what this
person is saying?

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.580
Or could you go on
the "CBS Morning Show"

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.630
and discuss some of the
science of "Gravity"?

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.640
So they were worried about
what the nitpicking could

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.451
do to impact their film.

00:05:24.451 --> 00:05:25.700
Like that was going to matter.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.630
It was a great film.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.562
But still, they did send me out.

00:05:28.562 --> 00:05:30.020
They said, go talk
to these people.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.603
Would you please
talk to these people?

00:05:31.603 --> 00:05:33.520
Because they cared.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.270
So there's a
dedication to getting

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.830
accurate and good storytelling.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.310
But there's also a bottom
line to be considered as well.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.410
GIA MORA: What about
the usefulness as a tool

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.040
to bring science literacy
to a general public

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.957
through entertainment?

00:05:47.957 --> 00:05:49.456
KEVIN GRAZIER: Oh,
well, then you're

00:05:49.456 --> 00:05:50.770
talking "Hollyweird Science".

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:51.824
The books--

00:05:51.824 --> 00:05:53.240
GIA MORA: Wait,
you mean the book?

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.800
KEVIN GRAZIER: The book.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.424
GIA MORA: Your book, that you're
about to have a second version

00:05:56.424 --> 00:05:57.390
of coming out in 2016?

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.890
KEVIN GRAZIER: Yes, that.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.150
GIA MORA: Do you mean this book?

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.000
KEVIN GRAZIER: Yes.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.470
So Stephen Cass,
my Co-Author, he

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.470
pitched a panel at
Comic-Con in 2007.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.580
And it was called Science
of Science Fiction.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.580
And it was three people.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.290
It was myself, and
it was Jaime Paglia,

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.070
my Showrunner from "Eureka", and
Phil Plait, the Bad Astronomer.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.470
And it was a smash.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.990
We filled a huge room.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.420
And so it's been a thing
every year since then.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.860
It's changed names.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.480
But we saw the power
of science fiction

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.180
to teach the real science.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.320
And that's one of the
things that I latched

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.740
onto when I got a job
as a Science Advisor,

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.365
is I'm going to be
able to actually use

00:06:36.365 --> 00:06:38.270
this to teach the real science.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.050
So Stephen and I started the
"Hollyweird Science" books.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.660
And we decided that in
addition to taking examples

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.460
from TV and film and
saying, this is good

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.882
and this is bad, we
would also approach this

00:06:49.882 --> 00:06:51.340
from the screenwriter's
standpoint,

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.120
so that people understand
why it's not always good.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.212
And why sometimes it's bad,
and maybe even bad on purpose.

00:06:57.212 --> 00:06:58.420
I've used that example twice.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.690
Let me give you an example
about bad on purpose.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.637
"Breaking Bad" and "CSI" are
shows that actively, at times,

00:07:04.637 --> 00:07:06.220
degrade the accuracy
of their science.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.040
Because on your
hour-long drama, you

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.540
don't want to be
teaching people how

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.740
to build bombs or make meth.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.700
So they would actively try
to make it seem real but not.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.390
So we decided we would
use these books to teach

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:20.610
the real science.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.990
But rather than
getting in the muck

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.650
of the cult of the nitpicker,
we decided early on

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.540
that no one wants
to read 250, 300

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.720
pages of negativity or snark.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.360
Except maybe the nitpickers.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.530
GIA MORA: I was going
to say, isn't that

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:35.405
what the internet is?

00:07:35.405 --> 00:07:37.985
It's just page
after page of snark.

00:07:37.985 --> 00:07:40.010
KEVIN GRAZIER: It
can be if you let it.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.520
If you want to go to one
of the quotes we have,

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.720
"The lowest vibrations
of human existence."

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.550
Yes, it can be that.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.190
But we decided to stay positive.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.590
We're not beneath
calling someone

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.610
on the carpet for
really bad science.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:59.320
And in Chapter 3,
I go off on a film

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.461
that I thought had the worst
depiction of scientists ever.

00:08:03.461 --> 00:08:05.950
(WHISPERING) "Red Planet".

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:09.200
"Red Planet"-- horrible science.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.980
Oh, scientists.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.370
The scientists were
really-- ah, no.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:19.430
I just-- Anyway, so we
will complain judiciously.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.800
But generally, we stay positive.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.290
We try to make it a positive
educational experience,

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.530
while at the same time,
helping people understand

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.430
the screenwriter care abouts,
the director care abouts

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.179
and what it's like
to actually craft

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:36.875
an hour-long drama or a
film with science concerns.

00:08:36.875 --> 00:08:37.500
GIA MORA: Sure.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.289
I understand the
perspective of the writer

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:43.539
to need to tell their narrative.

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:47.620
What do you attribute
the audience's change

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.580
in needing science
to be accurate?

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.960
Is it just because of the
comments of the internet?

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.850
Is it because science has become
more of a cultural phenomenon

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.120
at large, that more and more
people are interested in

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.040
and care about?

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.600
Or is it driven by the
screenwriter's need

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.430
to tell these narratives?

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.380
KEVIN GRAZIER: There's a lot
of things that you asked there.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.920
And one of the things
we continually hear

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.940
is how bad American
science literacy is.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.640
But when you hear
that quoted, it

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.110
turns out they're
quoting K12 numbers.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.460
But when you get to
adults, turns out

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:25.880
that Americans are second in
the world in science literacy

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.880
behind only Sweden.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.950
Which explains why they
make great cell phones.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:30.449
Right?

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:38.420
And by the way, before
people say, yeah!

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:39.600
Our science literacy is bad.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.410
It's not as bad as a
lot of other countries

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:43.290
at the adult level.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:44.910
And that's been
attributed to the fact

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.530
that we all have to take
science electives in college,

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:49.570
at least one.

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:53.420
And that's different at
variance with other countries.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.920
So we're generally
reasonably science literate.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.630
And there's the
internet, where a lot

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:02.380
of science literacy and science
illiteracy can get propagated.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.670
And also, when you've got people
complaining about something--

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:09.330
and sometimes these are
trolls, people who are just

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:13.000
mean-spirited people who just
want to pick on something--

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.250
we did a panel recently, at
the WonderCon convention,

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.850
about Hollywood science
and science in TV and film.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.840
And Ashley Miller,
who's a screenwriter,

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.730
he said something that I think
was really, really important.

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:28.190
He says, it's easy to see on the
internet five people tweeting

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.960
and think it's a movement.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.210
Because they're
talking so loudly

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:37.180
and complaining so vociferously
that you realize that there's

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.010
a whole bunch of people who
are just taking this in,

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.230
and may even be saying,
you're kind of a boob.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.900
Or maybe saying, dude, that's
totally right, or whatever.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.040
So you just can't tell.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.634
But sometimes it's the
squeaky wheel kind of thing.

00:10:51.634 --> 00:10:52.300
GIA MORA: Right.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.140
So are there squeaky wheels
that say positive things?

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.300
Like, wow, I saw gravity.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.327
And now I, seven-year-old
girl, think

00:10:58.327 --> 00:11:00.160
I'm going to be an
astronaut when I grow up.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.070
KEVIN GRAZIER: There are some.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:03.070
There are some who have
said, this is fantastic.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:08.342
I mean, I think the seven Oscars
said somebody kind of liked it,

00:11:08.342 --> 00:11:09.800
whether or not the
science sold it.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.519
I mean, yeah, the science
was both the protagonist

00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:15.310
and the antagonist in
that film, wasn't it?

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:15.530
GIA MORA: Sure.

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:16.904
KEVIN GRAZIER:
The antagonist was

00:11:16.904 --> 00:11:20.340
the Kessler syndrome and the
propagation of orbital debris.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:24.520
And the solution, there were
several scientific solutions

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.720
that just sequentially
solved one problem at a time,

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.080
till you get to the end.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:29.320
GIA MORA: Right.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.790
I mean, we have
three basic stories.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:31.290
Right?

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.460
Man vs. Man, Man vs.
Nature, and Man vs. Himself.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.420
KEVIN GRAZIER: Right.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.650
And you had all
three, in this case.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:37.483
GIA MORA: It's true.

00:11:37.483 --> 00:11:42.030
She's got to overcome her
psychological hallucinations.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.920
Spoiler alert.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.010
Sorry.

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:47.410
But she's also got to
fight her way against being

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:50.612
in outer space, which
is certainly difficult.

00:11:50.612 --> 00:11:52.070
And "The Martian",
of course, deals

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:54.260
with many of the same
sort of thematic elements.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.870
KEVIN GRAZIER:
And "The Martian",

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.950
we interviewed Andy Weir
for the second book, which

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:03.590
we are wrapping up right now.
"Beyond Hollywood Science"

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.976
is dominating my life right now.

00:12:05.976 --> 00:12:07.850
Literally, I spend every
waking hour writing,

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:11.400
when I'm not teaching
my astronomy class.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.670
The second book, the subtitle
is "From Rocket Ships

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:14.880
to Microchips".

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.760
And we talk a lot
about space things.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.480
We actually interviewed Andy
Weir about "The Martian".

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:25.030
And essentially, "The Martian"
is a classical cascade failure

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:28.480
told on a Martian setting,
with a very human element.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.880
GIA MORA: So stories like "The
Martian" and "Gravity" are not,

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.570
in my mind, what I would
think of as classic examples

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:36.460
of science fiction.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.440
Although they, by
definition, are.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.140
But the idea of
science fiction being

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.460
sort of these
dystopic worlds that

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.310
allow us to examine cultural
phenomenon that are happening

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:46.920
now, but through
a different lens

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.200
with a different perspective.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.450
Of course, you had "Defiance".

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:52.900
You had "Battlestar Galactica".

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.150
Those are what I would think
of as more classical sci-fi.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.470
So tell me more about that.

00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:59.320
Tell me the difference
between working

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.350
on a project like
"Gravity", which

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:06.330
is driven by the limitations or
the structures of what we know

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.494
we can control,
versus a world where

00:13:09.494 --> 00:13:10.660
it's "Battlestar Galactica".

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.154
Like, there's a whole
other universe of reality

00:13:13.154 --> 00:13:15.570
there, that we've already
solved the whole long-term space

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:17.704
travel problem.

00:13:17.704 --> 00:13:19.370
KEVIN GRAZIER: Wow,
there's a lot there.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:22.280
But this might go a long
way towards addressing

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.220
that succinctly.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:27.410
Is that there is a term used--
and I'm dating myself here--

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:30.880
for the series, "Space:
1999", in the mid '70s.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.550
And they called it
Science Faction,

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:36.820
where that wasn't that
far in the distant future.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.435
The technology
wasn't a big leap.

00:13:38.435 --> 00:13:40.810
At least, the technology of
the humans wasn't a big leap.

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:42.530
They would eventually
encounter aliens.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.950
So it's where you're
telling the story

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:47.100
in the not-too-distant
future, where

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.360
the technology is plausible.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.434
And I can see that.

00:13:49.434 --> 00:13:51.600
Even if there's leaps,
they're not really big leaps.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.400
And they're things that you can
reasonably project for things

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.400
that are here in the now.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.650
So "Gravity" and "The
Martian", I'd say,

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:01.060
would fall into that
realm, where you're just

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:05.590
making sure you get the
science as right as possible,

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:08.545
with a few story conceits
that we understood going in.

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:14.540
Well, firstly, another thing
I'm just writing about now

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.630
is a lot of the real-world
issues about space travel

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.626
are completely obviated
by something that's

00:14:19.626 --> 00:14:20.750
a production consideration.

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:21.930
It's artificial gravity.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.346
A lot of the horrible things
that happen to the human body

00:14:24.346 --> 00:14:25.888
just go away with
artificial gravity.

00:14:25.888 --> 00:14:27.595
But if you don't have
artificial gravity,

00:14:27.595 --> 00:14:28.966
you're showing people floating.

00:14:28.966 --> 00:14:30.340
And how many
productions do that?

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.810
"The Expanse" did it.
"Apollo 13" did it.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:37.090
And they did it in the Vomit
Comet, with the KC-135.

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:39.370
Or not KC, the 135 that dives.

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:42.679
And you get 20 seconds
of weightlessness.

00:14:42.679 --> 00:14:45.220
GIA MORA: Yeah, as an actor,
I'm both titillated by that idea

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.374
and absolutely horrified.

00:14:46.374 --> 00:14:48.040
That, like, you have
20 seconds to shoot

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.486
your scene while you're
actively wanting to throw up.

00:14:50.486 --> 00:14:51.610
KEVIN GRAZIER: No pressure.

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:52.200
GIA MORA: None at all.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:52.780
None at all.

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:53.440
KEVIN GRAZIER: It's
my understanding,

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.439
for people who've done
that, that people usually

00:14:55.439 --> 00:14:58.020
lose it on about the
sixth parabola, out of 48.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.755
GIA MORA: Oh!

00:14:59.755 --> 00:15:01.380
I'm going to lose it
just hearing that.

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.142
That sounds rough.

00:15:04.142 --> 00:15:06.600
KEVIN GRAZIER: That's actually
something that we talk about

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.590
in this next book,
is you never see--

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:10.619
except for in the
beginning of "Gravity"--

00:15:10.619 --> 00:15:12.160
people suffering
from space sickness.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:12.670
GIA MORA: Right.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:13.960
KEVIN GRAZIER: And
there's a reason for that.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.300
You don't want to, in the
middle of your dramatic scene,

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:16.800
excuse me.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.150
And somebody goes and then--

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.090
GIA MORA: Well, sure.

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:20.740
I mean, that speaks
to the mundanity.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.948
And I'm not even sure I'm
saying that word correctly.

00:15:22.948 --> 00:15:25.150
But the mundane
existence, in some ways.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:28.110
Like, if you're
on the ISS, you're

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:30.062
surrounded by wires
and these things.

00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:31.020
And you have a mission.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.340
And you have this work
that you're doing.

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.120
And it's regulated.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:33.970
And you have sleep schedules.

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:34.719
And you have this.

00:15:34.719 --> 00:15:37.697
That, in and of
itself, is not fodder.

00:15:37.697 --> 00:15:39.030
It's not "Melrose Place", right?

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:40.030
KEVIN GRAZIER: It's not.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:43.061
And in fact, on ISS, the flight
engineers spend a lot of time

00:15:43.061 --> 00:15:43.810
doing maintenance.

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.309
And then the next
day, they wake up,

00:15:45.309 --> 00:15:47.590
and they go back and do
maintenance all day again.

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:50.132
One of the problems
they found with ISS--

00:15:50.132 --> 00:15:52.340
and that's going to be
addressed in future missions--

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.370
is that their time
is over scheduled.

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.720
They have no free time of
their or, or little free time

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.620
of their own, or not
enough free time,

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.670
that they feel that they're
overburdened with that.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.060
And here I am in space.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.930
And I'm fixing the toilet.

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:05.880
Because the fan broke.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.540
And without that,
this could get ugly.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:10.990
But there's all
those things that

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.656
get in the way of the
story, unless they

00:16:12.656 --> 00:16:13.660
become front and center.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:14.510
Which they could.

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:16.160
But then again, there's a
production consideration

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.076
of artificial gravity.

00:16:17.076 --> 00:16:19.380
So that mitigates a
lot of potential drama,

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.620
because of the
production consideration.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.570
And one thing that
I find-- and this

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:26.320
is a complaint I make
in the second book--

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.390
is that when people
want to complain,

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:29.531
you may not like something.

00:16:29.531 --> 00:16:31.530
And you have no other
complaint so you just say,

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:33.857
oh, there's sound in space.

00:16:33.857 --> 00:16:34.940
That's a common complaint.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.220
We get that by now.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.150
And what the people
have found, there's

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:41.070
studies that the audience
is actually pulled out

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.770
of the drama as much when
you don't show sound in space

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:44.900
as when you do.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.060
I mean, "Gravity" didn't.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.720
"Firefly" didn't.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.532
But some shows, you're
satisfied with that,

00:16:51.532 --> 00:16:55.720
with knowing that, seeing
that immediate sound or action

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.800
sound.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.140
Jane Espenson,
whose screenwriter

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.390
was on a panel of
science in Hollywood,

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.163
she said, why don't
we just consider

00:17:04.163 --> 00:17:05.329
that part of the soundtrack?

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:07.140
Solved.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.280
So you get rid of that.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.196
But that's a common
complaint when people just

00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:10.930
want to complain.

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.130
But I guess a more common
complaint you could make,

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.546
is why don't people complain
about the artificial gravity?

00:17:15.546 --> 00:17:17.800
Because that's just
as big of a trope.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.300
It's used just as often.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.250
And yet, there's so many
things you could do.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.220
So my point is, when people
go to the no sound in space,

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.394
it's just lost its meaning.

00:17:27.394 --> 00:17:28.060
GIA MORA: Right.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.684
Well, we've been sort
of preconditioned

00:17:29.684 --> 00:17:31.630
to expect a lot of
different kinds of sounds,

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:34.360
things that you and I would not
be sitting here and wondering,

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.469
like, why is her water
bottle not cracking?

00:17:36.469 --> 00:17:38.260
But in the movies,
they're going to add it.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:38.670
And it's like--

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:39.210
[CRACKING SOUND]

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:39.710
Right?

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.320
Because we want to have
that amplified somehow.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.060
And because sound in
particular, at least for me,

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.200
is such a clue.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:51.040
It's subtle emotional
undertoning too.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.670
So there's another
purpose for having

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.070
a choice to put sound,
especially in something

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.812
like in space.

00:17:56.812 --> 00:17:58.770
KEVIN GRAZIER: Well,
funny you should say that.

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:04.760
Because in the "Hollyweird
Science" books, we have boxes.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.160
We separate some the
hardcore science, the math,

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.710
into science boxes.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:11.414
So you don't have to read these.

00:18:11.414 --> 00:18:13.330
They're not necessarily
part of the narrative.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:17.364
You can skip right over them if
you don't want to do the math.

00:18:17.364 --> 00:18:18.780
They'll add a
little extra insight

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:19.780
if you want to go there.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:21.807
But they won't harm
the flow of the chapter

00:18:21.807 --> 00:18:24.140
if you don't want to go there
and I want to do the math.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.630
But we also have Meet
the Storyteller boxes,

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:29.500
where we take a storyteller,
like a director, a producer,

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.320
writer.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.010
And we do a lot more of those
in the second and third book.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:35.180
There's going to be
a third, by the way.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.410
And one of those Meet
the Storyteller boxes we

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:40.350
have is with composer,
Bear McCreary.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:46.166
And we talk about that, how a
film composer-- actually, this

00:18:46.166 --> 00:18:47.040
is counter intuitive.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.081
And as a storyteller, you
like counter intuitive.

00:18:49.081 --> 00:18:51.475
Right?

00:18:51.475 --> 00:18:53.120
The Meet the Storyteller
box with Bear

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.420
is in a chapter about
space navigation.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.440
That initially might
be counter intuitive.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:03.160
But in the end of
Battlestar-- spoiler alert--

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:09.720
the climactic instant of that
entire force for a season show

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.420
was a blend of
science and music.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.620
And they tossed it to
Bear and myself and said,

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:16.840
you guys figure it out.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.650
How does this work?

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:20.330
And we figured out
how those notes

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.950
got mapped to coordinates.

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:24.630
So that's hence, why
he's in navigation.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.190
But Bear talks about
how important sound

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:30.920
is-- in his case, music--
as a storytelling mechanism,

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.750
and how important is it
in selling the story,

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.010
and how you would be watching.

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:37.310
And you'd be having a
different experience

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:38.540
if it wasn't for the music.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:39.373
GIA MORA: Absolutely

00:19:39.373 --> 00:19:42.970
KEVIN GRAZIER: And his belief
is if you notice his music,

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:46.570
even if you like it, he's
not done his job well.

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:50.640
You should like when you
buy the CD afterwards.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.481
GIA MORA: So totally
disparate question.

00:19:52.481 --> 00:19:53.230
KEVIN GRAZIER: OK.

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:55.425
GIA MORA: You worked on
"Pirates of the Caribbean"

00:19:55.425 --> 00:19:56.300
KEVIN GRAZIER: I did.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:56.950
Five.

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:00.257
The one that's
post-production right now.

00:20:00.257 --> 00:20:01.090
GIA MORA: OK, great.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:04.330
So tell us, since I
don't quite understand,

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:06.829
what is the science
behind a ghost ship?

00:20:06.829 --> 00:20:08.370
And is there some
scientific evidence

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.670
to back up why Johnny Depp
is so hot in that movie?

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:12.820
That's what I'd like to know.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.070
KEVIN GRAZIER: Scientific
evidence, I'm sure there is.

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:16.110
That's not my field.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:17.860
But you just gave me
an idea for a science

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:18.780
box in the fifth book.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:19.530
GIA MORA: Perfect.

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:20.879
You're welcome.

00:20:20.879 --> 00:20:21.920
KEVIN GRAZIER: Thank you.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.856
We have chapters
on neurosciences,

00:20:25.856 --> 00:20:27.480
why we're all the
same, and psychology,

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.690
why we're all different.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:30.290
We could probably fit
in somewhere in there.

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:31.206
GIA MORA: I like that.

00:20:31.206 --> 00:20:33.450
KEVIN GRAZIER:
But anyway, as far

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:37.240
as "Pirates of Caribbean
5", what I can say--

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:41.130
and who knows how much of
what my input will survive--

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:45.420
but is that long before I
was even on the project,

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:53.970
you could Google-- ha,
product placement-- the film

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:58.380
and find a description
of the new female lead.

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.940
And you can see that originally
she's believed to be a witch.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.490
And then it turns out,
she is a woman of science.

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:10.700
And they will sell how that
occurred in the mid 1700s.

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.710
But there is some
science that is

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:19.867
involved in their quest for some
artifact or goal, we'll say.

00:21:19.867 --> 00:21:20.700
GIA MORA: Excellent.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.366
KEVIN GRAZIER: And
that's all I can say,

00:21:22.366 --> 00:21:23.950
is that there is
science involved.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:27.510
And like a Science
Advisor should do,

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:31.664
is when you have some science--
your input's being solicited--

00:21:31.664 --> 00:21:32.580
you give them options.

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:33.510
We can do this.

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:34.700
And this means this,
this, and this.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:35.300
We can do this.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.320
And this means this,
this, and this.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.357
And you say, pick one
of these five options.

00:21:38.357 --> 00:21:39.440
That's kind of what I did.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.106
GIA MORA: Great.

00:21:40.106 --> 00:21:43.110
It seems like an unlikely sort
of place for that to appear.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.360
But obviously there's a
need for it in Hollywood.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.920
So two-part question.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:50.530
One, is how does one
become a Science Advisor?

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:53.660
And two, is can you tell us how
the science and entertainment

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:58.287
exchange has completely
revolutionized this call?

00:21:58.287 --> 00:21:59.495
KEVIN GRAZIER: I can do both.

00:21:59.495 --> 00:22:00.328
GIA MORA: Excellent.

00:22:00.328 --> 00:22:03.655
KEVIN GRAZIER: And how I
got to be a Science Advisor

00:22:03.655 --> 00:22:05.640
was somewhat more
difficult back then.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:10.490
And it's more in the traditional
Hollywood mold of it's

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:11.240
not what you know.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.375
It's who you know.

00:22:13.375 --> 00:22:17.740
And back when Star Trek,
some of these series

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:21.630
were on, like "Next Generation"
and "Voyager" and DS Nine,

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:24.450
they would take
unsolicited manuscripts.

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:27.830
You could send in a script to
Paramount without an attorney,

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:29.232
without an agent.

00:22:29.232 --> 00:22:30.190
And they would take it.

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:31.860
And they had a program
for looking at those

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:33.193
and potentially accepting those.

00:22:33.193 --> 00:22:36.570
Now, Paramount,
they were honest.

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:39.080
They said, we get
about 3,000 a year.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.110
And a good outcome
happens to single digits.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:43.026
So we're talking about
roughly 1 in 1000 odds,

00:22:43.026 --> 00:22:44.340
order of magnitude, right?

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:47.550
So my buddy, Jess,
Jess [? Sieger, ?]

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:50.730
who had been writing together
with me since we were 18--

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:53.690
because we did the college
radio thing together-- we

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:55.150
had an idea for a story.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:57.830
And we wrote this
"Voyager" script.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.160
I was in grad school.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.920
And he was working full time
at Wright-Patterson Air Force

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:02.420
Base.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.250
He has a family.

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:07.420
I was in grad school and
had a very, very demanding

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:08.750
dissertation advisor.

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:10.870
And that's a good thing.

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:14.070
And so we wrote this script in
what passed for our spare time,

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:18.060
and then sent it off to
Paramount and forgot it.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.050
Paramount said, we'll
make you two promises.

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:21.200
It'll get read and
you'll get it back

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.330
between eight weeks
and eight months.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:23.913
And that's all they
would promise you.

00:23:23.913 --> 00:23:25.390
So we wrote this
"Voyager" script.

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:26.650
And we sent it in.

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:28.400
And then we forgot about it.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.530
And seven months to the
day, I get a phone call

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:33.590
from the Executive Producer's
assistant saying that hey,

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:35.810
she loved your story.

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:37.810
Goes in a direction we
don't really want to go.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:39.394
So we're not going
to use it verbatim.

00:23:39.394 --> 00:23:41.310
Which, I should point
out, they eventually did

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:42.262
go in that direction.

00:23:42.262 --> 00:23:43.750
Klingons in the Delta Quadrant.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:47.620
Anyway, so they said,
we'd like to invite

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:49.020
you to come in and pitch.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:54.250
So what you do is you develop
three to five short pitches.

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:56.880
And we'll schedule you
with a staff writer.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.184
And you just go over
your story ideas.

00:23:59.184 --> 00:24:01.100
It's, like, basically
just something succinct.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:02.630
Like, here's an idea.

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:06.980
What if the Vidiians
want Neelix's other lung?

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.440
Or something like that.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.220
That was really
obscure and nerdy.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.310
You have to go back to the
early days of "Voyager".

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:16.410
So yeah, nerd cred, right?

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:18.790
You have to keep
establishing your nerd cred.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.850
So you pitched those stories.

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:26.010
And overwhelmingly what you hear
is there's only so many ideas,

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:26.510
they say.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:28.670
And we're all subject
to the same zeitgeist.

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:32.150
You almost always hear,
we just bought that.

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:33.620
We just said no to that.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:35.789
We just shot that.

00:24:35.789 --> 00:24:37.830
Most of my pitches already
had already been done.

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:41.430
Or in one case, the person
to whom I pitched kind of

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:42.430
chewed me out.

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:43.360
Well, that was
already established.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.670
We obviated that
in this episode.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:46.128
And he goes into
all these details.

00:24:46.128 --> 00:24:48.765
That was on that
night's episode.

00:24:48.765 --> 00:24:49.890
GIA MORA: Go figure, right?

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:50.960
KEVIN GRAZIER: Oh, well, hey
you want me to watch it now.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.390
GIA MORA: Jeez, yeah.

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:53.920
KEVIN GRAZIER:
But to the people,

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.460
I got to pitch several times.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.430
Because in the
first conversation

00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:00.029
with the producer's
assistant, I asked,

00:25:00.029 --> 00:25:01.820
is this something that
is a one-time thing?

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:02.917
Or can we come back?

00:25:02.917 --> 00:25:04.500
And she goes, oh no,
you can come back

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.649
as long as you're not
arrogant, rude, or an idiot.

00:25:06.649 --> 00:25:07.940
That's exactly what she's said.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.620
I can still hear
her saying that.

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.320
And so I pitched several times.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.970
And the two people to
whom I pitched most often

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:16.610
were Michael Taylor
and Bryan Fuller.

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:21.020
And they're both in their
first jobs in the industry.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.300
Michael Taylor, I've gone
on work with on Battlestar,

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:27.160
on "Blood and Chrome", on
"Defiance", on "Virtuality".

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.190
And if you've not seen
that, it's worth a watch.

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:31.860
It was a pilot that
didn't get picked up.

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:34.080
Bryan Fuller, he's Bryan Fuller.

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:36.030
He's gone on to be huge.

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:38.360
I'm a big fan of
everything he's done.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:42.320
From "Dead Like Me",
"Pushing Daisies",

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.325
and I was a huge "Hannibal" fan.

00:25:44.325 --> 00:25:45.783
GIA MORA: Oh, yeah,
beautiful show.

00:25:45.783 --> 00:25:47.510
KEVIN GRAZIER: Big Fannibal.

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:52.715
And when I saw some of Ron's
early Battlestar footage,

00:25:52.715 --> 00:25:54.840
I'd stayed in contact with
both of these gentlemen.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.260
I e-mailed Bryan.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.430
I said, Bryan, please,
please, please please

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:02.250
get me an interview.

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:04.147
Maybe I didn't demean myself.

00:26:04.147 --> 00:26:04.855
Who am I kidding?

00:26:04.855 --> 00:26:06.530
Yes I did.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:10.600
And Bryan hitched me to Ron
Moore, who interviewed me.

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.020
And I got the job.

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:16.640
And then "Eureka", it
turned out a season later,

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.510
"Eureka" and Battlestar
shared an office building

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:20.520
at Universal.

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.110
They shared the Rock
Hudson building.

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:24.134
And at a
getting-to-know-you lunch,

00:26:24.134 --> 00:26:26.050
the two writers assistants
were sitting there.

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:27.580
Hey, how do you deal with
your technical problems?

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:28.604
We have this guy at JPL.

00:26:28.604 --> 00:26:29.770
An hour later, I had a call.

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:30.520
I was on "Eureka".

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:31.250
GIA MORA: Wow!

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:32.430
KEVIN GRAZIER: So

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:34.590
GIA MORA: So it really is
once you're in the mill.

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:36.080
KEVIN GRAZIER: It is.

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:40.405
And at that point,
once I did Battlestar,

00:26:40.405 --> 00:26:41.780
there's maybe two
or three people

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.560
in the industry who have
more experience at that.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.270
So there's something
to be said for getting

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:45.885
valuable experience.

00:26:45.885 --> 00:26:47.380
It's not only getting
your name out there.

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:48.640
It's, like, I've done this.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.450
I've read a script.

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:50.241
I've red penned it.

00:26:50.241 --> 00:26:51.720
I've given notes.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.740
So that learning
curve is already

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.740
in the rear view mirror.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.990
Now, today it's a lot easier
to become a Science Advisor

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:04.480
because there is the Science
and Entertainment Exchange.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:08.499
The Exchange is actually a
part of the National Academy

00:27:08.499 --> 00:27:11.040
of Sciences, people who are way
more accomplished than I ever

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.500
will be as a scientist.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:17.020
But they have an office
here in Los Angeles.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.650
It's actually physically
located on the campus of UCLA,

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:21.990
though there's no
formal affiliation.

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:27.630
And you call, I
think, 1-844-NEED-SCI.

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:30.080
I'm not sure about the
toll free part of that.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.240
But you can look that
up on their website.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.600
And you call the Exchange.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.950
And you say, Hi, I'm a producer.

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:41.250
I'm doing a show about whatever.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:43.041
Yeah, I'm actually
doing a series

00:27:43.041 --> 00:27:45.290
based on the effects of gamma
rays in "Man in the Moon

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:46.590
Marigolds".

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:50.060
That's actually a film
from the late '60s.

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:53.820
And hey, I need somebody
who's a radiation expert.

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:55.320
And they will connect you.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.910
They have a huge database.

00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:01.340
So it's a lot easier for
people to get help these days.

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:03.090
And that feeds back
into what you said,

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:04.400
about people getting it right.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.680
There is now a
much better avenue

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.690
for knowing what you're getting.

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.430
Because you're getting the
expertise of the people

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:15.270
at the Exchange, who know who's
in their database and know what

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:16.480
their expertise is.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.720
And rather than just going
to the nearest college

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.900
and grabbing a scientist
and say, you'll do,

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:25.490
you have some knowledge built
into that huge database.

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:28.024
So it's a lot easier to
get accurate science.

00:28:28.024 --> 00:28:30.440
And I think that plays into
why science is getting better,

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.232
simply because it's
easier to get it right.

00:28:32.232 --> 00:28:34.565
GIA MORA: Well, it seems like
there's a nice reciprocity

00:28:34.565 --> 00:28:36.080
between these two worlds, too.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.702
That they want to
play fair together.

00:28:37.702 --> 00:28:38.660
They want to play nice.

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:41.110
KEVIN GRAZIER: I
think so far, I think,

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:43.250
actually, Hollywood is
friendlier to science

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:44.085
than vice versa.

00:28:44.085 --> 00:28:44.480
GIA MORA: Interesting.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.230
KEVIN GRAZIER: I think
a lot of scientists

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:49.950
haven't fully embraced what
the entertainment history can

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:51.960
do for us in getting our
message out and getting

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.020
our science out, and
having people understand

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:57.250
what it is that we do.

00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:00.210
I know a lot of scientists,
for example, don't particularly

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:01.510
care for "The Big Bang Theory".

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:03.560
Because they think it
shows them in a bad--

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.630
I think that's great for
the "Big Bang Theory".

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:10.060
Because one of the things that
isn't actively or often shown

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.100
is the culture of science.

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:15.020
And I will tell you, I have
never met any of those actors.

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.020
I've never been on the
set of "Big Bang Theory".

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:18.800
I've met their Science Adviser.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.610
I've met David Saltzberg.

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:21.740
But I don't know him well.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.440
But I'll tell you, I watch
"The Big Bang Theory",

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.020
and I know every one
of those characters.

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.270
GIA MORA: You know a scientist
who correlates to them?

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:30.270
KEVIN GRAZIER: Everyone.

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:31.460
Yes.

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.450
And the culture of
science is something

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:37.732
that since what you're seeing
is a snapshot of people's lives,

00:29:37.732 --> 00:29:39.940
you don't really see, always,
the culture of science.

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:43.630
Because there's not really
opportunity to do that.

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:45.250
But you do on "The
Big Bang Theory".

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:48.020
You see more of the culture.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.770
Let me back up a little
bit to a question

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:52.660
that you asked that
I skipped over.

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:56.910
Because I went off in this
direction, as I am want to do.

00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:59.820
As far as the different shows,
I mentioned Science Faction,

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:02.280
like "Gravity"
and "The Martian".

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.460
Well, you mention Battlestar
and "Eureka" as well.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:05.710
Those are two different shows.

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:08.630
And although the job Science
Advisor was a constant,

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:10.270
the job was
completely different.

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:12.187
And "Eureka" was about
the culture of science.

00:30:12.187 --> 00:30:13.603
Here's an opportunity
where we got

00:30:13.603 --> 00:30:15.130
to show people who
are really smart,

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:17.040
and how scientists interact.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:20.420
And our Showrunner, Jaime
Paglia's dad, Donald Paglia,

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:23.130
was a research MD at UCLA.

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:24.610
He worked on "Biosphere 2".

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:26.900
And we consulted with
him on "Ascension",

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.180
when we did "Ascension".

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.630
So Jaime was motivated
to get science

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:34.510
and the culture of science
as right as possible,

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:37.600
along with the science, which
was a guest star every week.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.230
A different type
of science came in

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:40.438
and guest starred every week.

00:30:40.438 --> 00:30:42.520
Whereas on Battlestar,
the science

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:46.150
was a simple description
of people's day.

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:49.550
They just happened to be on the
run in space from the Cylons.

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:52.930
But if you were describing your
day here and now to someone

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:55.770
in say, 1966. when Star
Trek first started,

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:57.880
your day would be
science fiction.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:03.132
I mean, it's well known now
that the flip phone was totally

00:31:03.132 --> 00:31:05.340
taken after-- yeah, you can
tell I'm from the Valley.

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:06.620
Like, totally taken after.

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.426
GIA MORA: (VALLEY GIRL
ACCENT) Like, totally.

00:31:07.426 --> 00:31:07.925
Ugh.

00:31:07.925 --> 00:31:09.422
KEVIN GRAZIER: Whatever.

00:31:09.422 --> 00:31:13.190
And taken after the
communicator from Star Trek.

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:17.252
Well, now the phones
that we have totally

00:31:17.252 --> 00:31:18.960
leave that the dust
technologically wise.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:19.020
GIA MORA: Sure.

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:20.884
KEVIN GRAZIER: The
smartphones-- do you ever

00:31:20.884 --> 00:31:22.050
see Kirk get a text message?

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:24.466
Or do you see Spock, (IMITATING
SPOCK) Excuse me, Captain.

00:31:24.466 --> 00:31:26.700
I am playing "Tetris".

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:27.200
No.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.910
So that completely out paced it.

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:31.854
And for that matter,
Siri and Cortana

00:31:31.854 --> 00:31:33.770
are smarter than the AI
was on the Enterprise.

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:36.140
I mean, they're pretty smart.

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:38.580
Have you ever asked Siri
to open the pod bay doors?

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:39.880
It's pretty amusing.

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.957
She has a whole repertoire.

00:31:41.957 --> 00:31:43.040
GIA MORA: Oh, I love that.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.710
KEVIN GRAZIER: Yeah.

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:47.240
So actually, those are pretty
smart, those assistants.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.080
And I think they're,
in some ways,

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.705
smarter than some
of the AIs that

00:31:50.705 --> 00:31:53.440
were shown in the mainframe
on the Enterprise,

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.910
whereas this is a handheld
device with a little bit

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:57.474
of network support.

00:31:57.474 --> 00:31:58.140
GIA MORA: Right.

00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:59.350
I don't know if
it's still active

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:00.849
or not, or if they've
closed it now.

00:32:00.849 --> 00:32:03.930
But there was an XPRIZE to come
up with Bones's scanner too.

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:04.690
KEVIN GRAZIER:
Yeah, the Tricorder.

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:05.070
GIA MORA: The Tricorder.

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:07.784
KEVIN GRAZIER: And I just saw,
last week, there is a scanner.

00:32:07.784 --> 00:32:09.200
And again, it links
to your phone.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.574
And it does link
to the internet.

00:32:10.574 --> 00:32:12.560
But you scan a food.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.320
And it will come
up and say, bread.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.980
This type of bread.

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:17.870
I think it will even
go to the manufacturer.

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:19.980
Basically, it's a
spectroscope, is what it is,

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.090
with a huge database.

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:23.630
And then it says,
this was calories.

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:25.055
This many carbs.

00:32:25.055 --> 00:32:26.480
So you can scan your food.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.526
And that's almost a
tricorder right there.

00:32:28.526 --> 00:32:29.400
GIA MORA: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.180
I just need it to
do that and then

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.270
say, like, just a red flash,
like, do not eat this!

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:36.145
That's what I would need
for it to be useful.

00:32:36.145 --> 00:32:38.478
KEVIN GRAZIER: And it's Friday
night, after a long week.

00:32:38.478 --> 00:32:40.090
And you say, go-- yourself.

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:40.390
GIA MORA: I say, pizza.

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:41.010
Yeah, exactly.

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:42.384
I say, that's what
I'm happening.

00:32:42.384 --> 00:32:43.300
It's Friday, kids.

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:43.810
It's pizza night.

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:44.430
KEVIN GRAZIER:
Yeah, that's right.

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:47.430
GIA MORA: Well, it's been such
a pleasure chatting with you.

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:48.638
KEVIN GRAZIER: It's been fun.

00:32:48.638 --> 00:32:51.400
GIA MORA: I'm going to open
it up to the floor now.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.727
We can have Livestream
questions as well.

00:32:53.727 --> 00:32:55.560
You got the e-mail
address to send those to.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.670
But for our live
studio audience,

00:32:57.670 --> 00:32:59.750
please come up to
our microphone.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:02.077
Tell us your name
and ask a question.

00:33:02.077 --> 00:33:03.785
KEVIN GRAZIER: Don't
all rush up at once.

00:33:03.785 --> 00:33:05.360
GIA MORA: Please, come on now.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.470
We got one brave soul.

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:07.620
Hooray.

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:08.720
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Josh.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.820
KEVIN GRAZIER: Hey, Josh.

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.903
GIA MORA: Do you work
mostly in the pre-production

00:33:11.903 --> 00:33:13.230
of a film or TV show?

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:15.560
Or is that also in post
or also during production?

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.600
Or what is your role
in different stages

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.030
of the development of a film?

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:21.280
KEVIN GRAZIER: That's actually
a really good question.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:24.960
And that's entirely
show dependent.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:28.364
On Galactica, for the most
part, I would get scripts

00:33:28.364 --> 00:33:29.530
and I would send them notes.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:31.680
I would say, do this or do that.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.850
Or here's a suggestion.

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:35.010
Or you might want to try this.

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:37.420
Only one season did
I go in, in advance,

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:38.810
and talk about some science.

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:40.724
And that was before
season 3, when they said,

00:33:40.724 --> 00:33:42.140
we're going to
really start to get

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:43.380
serious about finding Earth.

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:46.480
So we've been looking at
the Prophecies of Pythia,

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.709
if you remember.

00:33:47.709 --> 00:33:50.250
So what are things we can have
from the Prophecies of Pythia,

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:53.420
that can be omens or portents,
and help us lead to Earth?

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.150
So we want astronomical
events that that

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:57.160
could have been talked about.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.440
And here's an
interesting aside, which

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.250
has kind of under the radar, one
thing I like about Galactica,

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:05.460
is that-- this is
completely afield.

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:07.200
And so I'll try to
come dragging back

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.449
to answer the rest
of your question.

00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:10.532
But what's cool about
Galactica is all the things,

00:34:10.532 --> 00:34:12.404
all the questions, or
all the little things

00:34:12.404 --> 00:34:14.570
that we slipped in there
that hardly anyone noticed.

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:16.600
And the cool example is Pythia.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.040
If you remember the
show, President Roslin

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.929
was keen on the
Prophecies of Pythia.

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:21.840
Because she thought that
was going to lead us

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:22.840
to Earth and a new home.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:23.580
Right?

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.570
And those were in
their sacred scrolls.

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:30.889
Well, we learn in season three,
that these aren't prophecies.

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:33.320
She was actually
on a trip to Earth.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:37.620
So this is more a travelogue
than it was prophetic.

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:41.150
Since she was on a trip to
Earth, Pythia was a Cylon.

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:46.760
And you remember in season
1, when in an early episode,

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.920
Six tells Baltar, we
know your religious text

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.000
better than you do.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.719
Because one of us wrote them.

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:55.130
And if you get it, you get it.

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:56.921
And if you don't, it
flows under the radar.

00:34:56.921 --> 00:34:59.620
And it may enhance your
appreciation if you do get it.

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:01.480
But it doesn't harm
it if you don't.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.317
OK?

00:35:02.317 --> 00:35:03.150
But it's that level.

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:05.760
It's just describing
stuff or making sure

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.600
that it's consistent
and selling the world.

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:16.720
In "Eureka"-- and that's
the end member example--

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.560
until the last
episode of "Defiance",

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:23.600
I did everything on "Eureka"
that I ever did for any show

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:24.630
in "Eureka".

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:27.210
So I would come in
before the season start

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:30.010
and talk about here's
some cool new science

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:31.560
we might be able to use.

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.680
Of course, there's
always a thematic link.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.390
This science should link somehow
to what this character is going

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:38.020
through, what their journey is.

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:39.420
So there's always
a thematic link

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:41.820
between the science
and the story.

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.170
And it's all about the story.

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:46.340
But then I would go in
at maybe outlying stage,

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:48.890
and say, we can do
this or we can do that.

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:52.040
And then I would get the
scripts to give notes on.

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:56.240
But later, I would actually
look at special effects and say,

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.040
this looks good.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.220
Or maybe we can do this.

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:01.230
I would get calls
from Vancouver.

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:03.140
Is it "Had-ron" or "Hey-dron?"

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.420
It's either, actually.

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:05.010
It's one of those things.

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:05.210
I can go either way.

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:06.200
GIA MORA: Yes, I've
heard it both ways.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.940
Wait, so Vancouver,
because that's

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:08.325
where they were shooting?

00:36:08.325 --> 00:36:09.030
KEVIN GRAZIER: That's where
they're shooting, in Vancouver.

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.410
GIA MORA: OK, just to clarify.

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:09.880
KEVIN GRAZIER:
Yeah, they literally

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.060
shot next door to Battlestar 2.

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:11.500
GIA MORA: Because
I was, like, wait.

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:12.890
The Hadron Collider is
over in [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:13.400
KEVIN GRAZIER: No, no, no.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.370
Yeah, but they shot
right next to Battlestar,

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:16.370
in the same studios.

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:16.911
GIA MORA: Ah.

00:36:16.911 --> 00:36:23.430
KEVIN GRAZIER: And one time, in
the third episode, episode 103,

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:24.540
I got a call.

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:28.460
We had, like, five
whiteboards full of equations.

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:31.480
And it has to sell this
thing they're working on.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:35.030
So I literally wrote five
whiteboards of equations.

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:38.450
I think I faxed them
up to Vancouver.

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:40.820
And I was floored when
it came on screen.

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:42.730
And it was in my handwriting.

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:44.560
No idea how that happened.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.430
OK, so there's all these
things I did, ranging

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:50.260
from pre-production to post.

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:52.952
And like I said, until the
last episode of "Defiance",

00:36:52.952 --> 00:36:54.410
I did everything
on "Eureka" that I

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:56.590
did for any other series.

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:58.980
But on "Defiance", I
actually got a little bit

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:03.390
of input into some of the set
design aboard [? Soros, ?]

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:06.480
which was the Omec
ship at the very end,

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.490
if you saw "Defiance".

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:08.920
Anybody see "Defiance"?

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:09.420
No?

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:09.860
GIA MORA: No.

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:10.000
KEVIN GRAZIER: No
one saw "Defiance"?

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:10.480
GIA MORA: OK, well, now
you know what you're

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.380
going to binge this weekend.

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:11.660
Right?

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.368
KEVIN GRAZIER: Yeah,
highly recommend it.

00:37:13.368 --> 00:37:15.352
GIA MORA: Awesome.

00:37:15.352 --> 00:37:16.810
KEVIN GRAZIER:
Season one was good.

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:19.780
Season two and three
were off the hook.

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:20.697
I love that show.

00:37:20.697 --> 00:37:22.030
I miss all three of those shows.

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:22.760
I miss "Eureka".

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:23.524
I miss Battlestar.

00:37:23.524 --> 00:37:25.690
Would love to do something
Battlestar related again.

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:27.665
But anyway, does that
answer the question?

00:37:27.665 --> 00:37:28.290
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:29.040
KEVIN GRAZIER: OK.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:29.961
GIA MORA: Awesome.

00:37:29.961 --> 00:37:30.460
Next?

00:37:35.151 --> 00:37:36.400
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name's Kevin.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.200
You talked about the
Oh Please moments.

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.322
KEVIN GRAZIER: Yeah.

00:37:40.322 --> 00:37:42.120
GIA MORA: Do you have
some that you regret?

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.495
Or are there things
that you wish

00:37:43.495 --> 00:37:46.500
you had fought more for in some
of the movies that you've done?

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:47.060
KEVIN GRAZIER:
You'd be surprised

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:48.340
how often I get that question.

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:51.980
The question is--
I'll paraphrase it--

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:54.460
what's your biggest screw
up as a Science Advisor?

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:55.730
How's that?

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:57.992
You were obviously much
more polite about it.

00:37:57.992 --> 00:37:59.200
But yeah, I've got a big one.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.690
I got a big shiny one.

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:03.346
And the reason I can
talk about it openly--

00:38:03.346 --> 00:38:04.220
well, I would anyway.

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:05.920
Because you know, we can
write a book about it.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.100
Because it's always a
teachable moment-- but this

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:14.110
is one that I saw coming, and
I figured it out way too late.

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:16.520
But in the second
episode of Battlestar,

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:20.720
the Galactica is doing underway
replenishment of a ship called

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:21.930
the Virgon Express.

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:24.170
Which means they got lines
between the two ships.

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:26.280
They're pumping
water and/or fuel

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.430
or whatever, from Galactica
to the Virgon Express.

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:31.400
So they're physically
mated together.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.990
And then there is
an act of sabotage

00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:38.120
in which there were several
explosive charges in the water

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.580
holes on Galactica,
that explode and blow

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:41.750
outside of the Galactica.

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:44.030
And all this water is venting.

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:46.221
And Galactica goes nowhere.

00:38:46.221 --> 00:38:48.220
That would have imparted
what we call a Delta-v,

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:49.374
or a change of velocity.

00:38:49.374 --> 00:38:51.040
And it would have
either pulled it apart

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.680
from the Virgon Express, or at
least pulled them a little bit.

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.240
They would have had to
course correct for that.

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.040
And that is
something we probably

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:01.290
could have oversold
for dramatic effect.

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:03.457
Because we know that would
have imparted a momentum.

00:39:03.457 --> 00:39:05.456
And we probably could
have said it imparted more

00:39:05.456 --> 00:39:06.580
than it really might have.

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:09.770
And by the time I go,
oh no, I missed this,

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:16.285
and quick e-mail, I said, oh no.

00:39:16.285 --> 00:39:16.840
There's this.

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.548
And they said, sorry,
that ship's sailed.

00:39:18.548 --> 00:39:20.470
Ha ha ha ha.

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:21.430
Ship's sailed.

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:22.690
So that was my biggest one.

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:24.730
But let me go the
other direction,

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:26.260
where we knew the science.

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:29.710
But it was a filmmaker's choice.

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:32.960
When I first met with
the Cuarons-- plural.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.530
That's Alfonso and Jonas,
who co-wrote in screenplay,

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:37.460
in "Gravity" [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:40.100
We were in Chateau
Marmont, on Sunset,

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:43.024
in the lobby talking
about the film

00:39:43.024 --> 00:39:45.440
and what they were trying to
achieve and their motivation.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.570
The IMAX film for the
Hubble Servicing Mission

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:49.070
was a big motivation
for that film.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:51.020
Which you watched
that IMAX film,

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.650
and you can see that totally.

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:54.320
There's that word again.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.320
GIA MORA: Totally.

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:58.260
KEVIN GRAZIER: And
I said, well, here's

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:00.900
the one thing you're going
to have an issue with,

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:07.430
is that the closest the orbit
of Hubble and ISS ever get

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:12.080
is-- now, this is an
absolute best case.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.070
This will never happen
in the real world--

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:16.710
I said, is roughly between
here and the Mexican border.

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:19.005
You can't get from one
orbit-- and they're

00:40:19.005 --> 00:40:20.130
different inclinations too.

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:22.050
And it's hard to
change your tilt.

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:24.091
You're not going to get
from one orbit to another

00:40:24.091 --> 00:40:29.850
in the shuttle, let alone with
one backpack of gas and oxygen.

00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:30.790
So that's your gimme.

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:32.040
That's your suspend disbelief.

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.409
Go with us on this one
really fantastic thing.

00:40:34.409 --> 00:40:36.950
And we'll be more faithful to
the science the rest of the way

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:37.060
out.

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.270
So that was a choice.

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:40.150
But it was a choice.

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:41.570
There was options on the table.

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:44.860
I said, here's an idea.

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:47.560
We know that the
shuttle will not

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:49.985
be flying by the time
this film comes out.

00:40:51.131 --> 00:40:52.380
It's scheduled for retirement.

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:54.130
And this is going to
take a while to make.

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:55.840
Because this is
an ambitious film.

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:58.440
So it's a reasonable
design constraint

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.800
that the next
generation telescope

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.447
be serviceable from ISS easily.

00:41:03.447 --> 00:41:04.530
So I said, here's an idea.

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:06.370
We've got a strong female lead.

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:08.870
It's very female
centric, the story.

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:13.060
So why don't we thematically
link a new space telescope

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:14.580
that's closer to ISS?

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:16.910
And we'll call it
the Cannon Space

00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:18.700
Telescope, for
Annie Jump Cannon,

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:21.110
an early female astronomer?

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:26.194
And then we hit up Canon camera
for product placement dollars.

00:41:26.194 --> 00:41:27.360
And there's this long pause.

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.693
You missed your calling in life.

00:41:28.693 --> 00:41:30.450
You should've been a producer.

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:34.790
But one thing also, another
aside is that a lot of people

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:38.615
don't realize this--
and it's on the extras.

00:41:38.615 --> 00:41:40.240
But some people don't
watch the extras.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:43.630
There is actually a
companion film to "Gravity".

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:46.120
If you haven't seen it,
I highly recommend it.

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.372
It's only short.

00:41:47.372 --> 00:41:48.830
It's between 6 and
10 minutes long.

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:49.880
It's a short film.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:53.930
It's called "Aningaaq"--
A-N-I-N-G-A-A-Q.

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:58.940
And if you remember when-- and
my voice cracked. (SINGING)

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:00.500
Happy puberty to you.

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:06.732
Anyway, so-- Dr.
Stone is aboard-- God.

00:42:06.732 --> 00:42:07.440
I don't remember.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:11.190
She's in the Soyuz module.

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:13.430
She gets a brief
contact with someone

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:15.530
who's not speaking English.

00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:17.929
And she makes out
his name is Aningaaq.

00:42:17.929 --> 00:42:19.512
Remember, she's
howling with the dogs?

00:42:19.512 --> 00:42:19.870
AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:21.536
KEVIN GRAZIER: This
is that conversation

00:42:21.536 --> 00:42:22.476
from the other side.

00:42:22.476 --> 00:42:23.350
AUDIENCE: Oh!

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:25.290
KEVIN GRAZIER: It's
actually on an ice floe,

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:29.440
in a frozen patch of
ice north of Norway.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.630
And he's speaking Inuit.

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:34.530
So it's Aningaaq's
story of that.

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:35.310
It's great.

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:36.190
It's only short.

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:38.335
GIA MORA: It's the Rosenkranz
and Guildenstern to "Hamlet".

00:42:38.335 --> 00:42:38.600
Right?

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:39.000
KEVIN GRAZIER: Yeah.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:39.761
Yeah, yeah.

00:42:39.761 --> 00:42:40.260
It is.

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:41.409
And have you ever seen it?

00:42:41.409 --> 00:42:41.950
GIA MORA: No.

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:43.180
I saw it in the theater.

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.780
So I didn't have the DVD.

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.480
KEVIN GRAZIER: It's on YouTube.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.230
It's worth seeing.

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:49.570
And it's official Warner
Brothers production,

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:51.640
written by Jonas Cuaron,
directed by Jonas.

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:52.930
So I recommend that.

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:54.360
It's worth your time.

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:54.590
GIA MORA: Very cool.

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:56.460
KEVIN GRAZIER: You'll watch
it more than once, promise.

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:57.220
GIA MORA: You have
so many things

00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:58.511
to now watch over your weekend.

00:42:58.511 --> 00:43:00.060
This is going to be great.

00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:00.860
Please, come on up.

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:01.920
KEVIN GRAZIER: Did I
answer your question?

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:02.780
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:03.530
KEVIN GRAZIER: OK.

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:04.954
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:04.954 --> 00:43:06.120
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name's Tom.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.120
I was wondering, is there
any particular sorts

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:12.520
of things that happened that
you wish people did better

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.128
in the movies?

00:43:14.128 --> 00:43:17.174
Where is the place
to improve on?

00:43:17.174 --> 00:43:18.840
KEVIN GRAZIER: The
question is, is there

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:22.570
things places people did
better and places to improve?

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:25.610
You know, I can't say-- yes.

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:26.230
Yes, there is.

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:28.860
I was going to say, I can't
point to any one theme.

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:31.172
But I think there
is one that bugs me.

00:43:31.172 --> 00:43:32.130
It's not even my field.

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:34.875
Usually you'll find
that scientists

00:43:34.875 --> 00:43:38.080
will overlook bad science
if it's not in their field.

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:41.210
And then if it is in their
field, we're fighting.

00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:44.260
I have a problem with you.

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:46.930
And since I'm an
orbit dynamics person,

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:50.720
so I at least am glad I
had some say in "Gravity".

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.220
Science isn't perfect in that.

00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:56.070
But it's as best as we
could make it and still tell

00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:57.040
that story.

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:01.590
But the one thing that irks
me to death is the 10% myth.

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:04.100
The we only use
10% of our brains.

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:05.870
Imagine if we could use it all.

00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:09.050
Now, what's funny
is in "Eureka",

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:13.220
we have a character who says,
we only use 10% of our brains

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:14.980
at any given time.

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:18.135
Imagine if we could use
it-- and that qualifier

00:44:18.135 --> 00:44:19.010
didn't make it right.

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:20.720
But it made it more
closer to being right.

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.553
And then people jumped
all over me and said,

00:44:22.553 --> 00:44:23.990
did you listen to what he said?

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:28.519
So I at least got that
done better in "Eureka"

00:44:28.519 --> 00:44:29.310
than has been done.

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:31.110
But yeah, the 10% myth irks me.

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:33.620
And you know, "Lucy" was
based on that premise.

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:34.600
And "Limitless" is too.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.990
But I think "Limitless"
sells a little better.

00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:41.514
But I was reading
recently about quicksand.

00:44:41.514 --> 00:44:42.930
How does quicksand
relate to this?

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:45.720
Quicksand is a trope that was
done to death in the '60s.

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.764
And it was always a source
of jeopardy in westerns.

00:44:48.764 --> 00:44:50.930
And now it's been years
since you've seen quicksand.

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:52.480
Because we all
know that survival.

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.130
You float.

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:54.600
You just lay back and float.

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.900
And you just wait for
somebody to pull you out.

00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:00.220
So quicksand has just gone away.

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:01.920
And it was overused.

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.140
I'm hoping that
the 10% myth goes

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:05.910
the direction of quicksand.

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:06.770
It's been overused.

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:08.311
We've milked that
for all it's worth.

00:45:08.311 --> 00:45:10.130
And we all know
it's just not true.

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:12.316
So can we just move on?

00:45:12.316 --> 00:45:13.190
And that's one thing.

00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:18.499
We kind of harped on that in
the "Hollyweird Science" books,

00:45:18.499 --> 00:45:20.540
and haven't even got to
the neuroscience chapter.

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.030
And that's in book three.

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:24.930
Oh, by the way, we added a
neuroscientist, Dr. Jessica

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:28.590
Cail, who's a psycho
pharmacologist at Pepperdine.

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:32.040
She's on as an author in
the third book as well.

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.910
So that stuff, I'm sure
she'll have something

00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:36.170
to say about the 10% myth.

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:39.500
I have no doubt she'll be
opinionated on that topic.

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:40.970
GIA MORA: Come on ahead.

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:42.670
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Nick.

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:45.450
Unfortunately, or well, I
guess, fortunately, you actually

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:48.470
just answered my question
answering his question.

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:52.290
I was going to ask about
some of your biggest gripes

00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:56.815
about popular misconceptions
that you get, maybe,

00:45:56.815 --> 00:45:57.770
nitpicked on.

00:45:57.770 --> 00:46:00.355
Like you were mentioning
earlier about people nitpicking,

00:46:00.355 --> 00:46:01.600
but they were actually wrong.

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:04.400
KEVIN GRAZIER: I've got
another one that I can tell,

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:07.150
and this is from Battlestar.

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:09.990
In an episode in
season 3-- gosh,

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:12.280
they're kind of
blending together-- we

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:16.010
had a situation where Chief
Tyrol and his wife, Cally,

00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:17.280
were both maintenance workers.

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:18.600
The fleet is low on
maintenance workers.

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:19.516
So they're overworked.

00:46:19.516 --> 00:46:20.430
They're stressed.

00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:23.450
And the Chief has
a simple repair.

00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:27.800
He's going to repair a slow
leak in a freight air lock.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.240
And this is an easy repair.

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.787
So he assigns his
wife to join him,

00:46:30.787 --> 00:46:32.620
simply so they can spend
some time together.

00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:33.384
[THUD]

00:46:33.384 --> 00:46:35.800
That was my phone falling out
my pocket, hitting the stage

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:36.550
floor, by the way.

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:40.830
Thank goodness for
[INAUDIBLE] cases.

00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:45.100
Anyway, so he assigns his
wife to work with him, Cally.

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:47.760
And then they're in working
in this freight air lock.

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:50.440
And the inner door triggers.

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.255
And now we are stuck.

00:46:52.255 --> 00:46:53.380
And they can't get it open.

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:57.171
We're stuck in an air lock
that's slowly evacuating.

00:46:57.171 --> 00:46:59.670
And rather than having something
that resembles some quality

00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:02.566
time together, we're going to
die and leave behind an orphan.

00:47:02.566 --> 00:47:04.190
And orphans don't do
well in the fleet.

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:07.905
So now this nice pleasant
sort of leisurely day

00:47:07.905 --> 00:47:10.860
has turned into a danger
that's threatening our lives

00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:15.620
and our bloodline, so to speak.

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:18.600
Anyway, so they're
in this air lock.

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:19.500
It's evacuating.

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:21.720
And since it's evacuating,
it's getting cold as well.

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:22.261
So it's cold.

00:47:22.261 --> 00:47:23.880
It's damp.

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:27.420
And the solution
to this problem is

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:30.850
to place a Raptor
outside a spacecraft,

00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:32.770
evacuate it, put
people in space suits.

00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:34.150
Open it up.

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:37.940
Blow the explosive bolts on
the door, and blow it out.

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:40.350
And the remaining air
pushes our characters out.

00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:43.620
They're caught by the Raptor,
close it, repressurize.

00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:44.960
Treat for the symptoms.

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:45.820
OK?

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:50.490
Now, two complaints-- none
of which were justified--

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:52.030
happened overwhelmingly
with that.

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:53.740
And that has been done before.

00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:56.552
Part of it, without the exposure
to space was done in 2001.

00:47:56.552 --> 00:47:58.010
And a very similar
thing was done--

00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:00.920
and I didn't realize at
the time-- in "Titan A.E."

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:05.055
An animated film that Joss
Whedon wrote, by the way--

00:48:05.055 --> 00:48:07.340
is people said,
well, they freeze.

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:08.780
Everyone knows space is cold.

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:11.730
It's very cold in space.

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:12.880
I do a crappy Khan.

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:17.160
Anyway, yes, it's 2.7 kelvins.

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.690
But you need a medium
to carry away the heat.

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:21.780
You'll notice that
room-temperature bathwater

00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:23.500
is colder than
room-temperature air

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:24.930
because there's a denser medium.

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:25.770
There's no medium.

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:29.270
So to rid yourself of heat,
you need to radiate that away.

00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:31.780
And that is a slow process.

00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:34.104
So they're
functionally insulated.

00:48:34.104 --> 00:48:35.520
They're not going
to lose any heat

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:38.810
in that short trip between
the air lock and the Raptor.

00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:44.820
Then people who saw "Outland",
which was a movie, an '81 film,

00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:45.860
supposedly about mining.

00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:50.685
And it was "High Noon" on Io, is
what it was, with Sean Connery.

00:48:50.685 --> 00:48:52.560
They had an effect that
they were partial to,

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:55.430
where people exposed to
the vacuum of space popped.

00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:57.560
And then there was the
end of "Total Recall",

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:04.550
where Arnold and
Melina-- I'm trying

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:05.970
to remember Arnold's name.

00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:07.200
I'm blanking on it.

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:09.408
I keep coming up with
Cohaagen. But Cohaagen was also

00:49:09.408 --> 00:49:10.620
on the surface with them.

00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:11.220
Quaid.

00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:11.720
Quaid.

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:13.595
Melina and Quaid were
on the surface of Mars,

00:49:13.595 --> 00:49:15.380
and their eyes were
bugging out and stuff.

00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:17.640
And people said, oh,
they would have popped.

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.070
And no, they wouldn't have.

00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:21.600
If they didn't
hold their breath,

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:23.910
the air is going to take the
path of least resistance.

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:26.500
And it's going to come out their
mouth and nose for the most

00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:27.000
part.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.040
Now, some air is going to be
trapped in small blood vessels.

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:32.440
You might get blood
vessels burst in the eye.

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:37.314
Maybe the eardrum will puncture,
nosebleed and things like that.

00:49:37.314 --> 00:49:38.230
But that's survivable.

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:40.880
In fact, astronauts
early in the program

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:43.600
were exposed to the
vacuum and survived it.

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.140
And in fact, what happens
is when they bring them

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:49.150
back aboard, you see
Chief getting out

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:50.890
of bed in the sick bay slowly.

00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:52.820
Because the Bends
attacks the joints.

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:54.480
And he's in a lot of pain.

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:57.570
And then he goes
next to the room.

00:49:57.570 --> 00:49:59.699
And Cally is in a
hyperbaric chamber.

00:49:59.699 --> 00:50:01.490
Because it was harder
on her, because she's

00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:04.480
(WHISPERING) not a Cylon.

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:07.024
And he looks down at her
in the hyperbaric chamber.

00:50:07.024 --> 00:50:09.190
And when she looks over at
him, if you look closely,

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:12.130
the blood vessels in
her eye had popped.

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:14.130
And what's really fun
is that because we

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:16.620
caught so much
crap with that, we

00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:18.940
did a film called "The Plan".

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:20.164
Has anyone seen "The Plan"?

00:50:20.164 --> 00:50:21.580
Or has anyone not
seen "The Plan"?

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:24.038
If you didn't know it, you got
two more hours of Battlestar

00:50:24.038 --> 00:50:25.050
to watch.

00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:27.212
It's basically "The
Plan" is the first two

00:50:27.212 --> 00:50:29.670
years of the Galactica, told
more or less, from the Cylon's

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:30.490
view point.

00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:32.130
And it was written
by Jane Espenson,

00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:35.740
who is, in part, responsible
for us being here today.

00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:39.800
Jane, after we got so many
people who griped about that,

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.540
we actually had
somebody-- a Cylon,

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:46.520
rather than face his wife-- with
whom he was very much in love--

00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:49.320
rather than face her when she
is armed with the knowledge

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:52.470
that he is actually a Cylon,
he decided to commit suicide.

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:54.740
And he blows himself
out an air lock.

00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:57.780
And again, it rushes out.

00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:01.860
And as the air expands,
the humidity in your breath

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:03.230
would freeze.

00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:05.580
And then you see him after
this event has occurred.

00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:08.140
And he's got crystals of ice
around his mouth and nose,

00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:10.015
which is basically
saying, hmm! to the people

00:51:10.015 --> 00:51:11.265
who complained the first time.

00:51:13.416 --> 00:51:15.624
AUDIENCE: You are very good
at answering my questions

00:51:15.624 --> 00:51:16.390
before I ask them.

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:18.900
Because I was going
to ask, again,

00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:22.434
what's your way of setting
the record straight?

00:51:22.434 --> 00:51:24.100
KEVIN GRAZIER: The
way of setting record

00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:26.250
straight is just by writing
"Hollyweird Science".

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:28.340
And you know,
"Hollyweird Science"

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:31.300
is about talking about
accurate science,

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:32.750
setting the record
straight sounds

00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:34.420
like get-evenism a little bit.

00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:36.140
And I'm not beneath that.

00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:37.679
There is some that in book two.

00:51:37.679 --> 00:51:39.470
Some of the complaints
about "Gravity" that

00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:41.511
were non complaints-- we
actually cover the Chief

00:51:41.511 --> 00:51:44.490
and Cally issue in that book.

00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:48.440
And in "Sunshine"-- the
2007 film, "Sunshine"--

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:50.450
you see somebody
exposed to space.

00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:51.900
His arm gets hit
and it shatters.

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:53.460
And we said, well, no.

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:56.040
But also, some of the
complaints about "Gravity", we

00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:58.790
say, well, about getting
from one orbit to another?

00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:59.660
Completely valid.

00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:00.966
That was a choice.

00:52:00.966 --> 00:52:02.340
But some of the
other complaints,

00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:04.080
like the scene where
she has to let them go,

00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:05.020
there are a lot of
complaints about that.

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:07.130
There's nothing wrong with
the physics of that scene.

00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:08.430
But a lot of people complained.

00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:11.010
And we actually go step
by step what happened,

00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:12.890
and why there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:14.910
So there is some setting
the record straight,

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:17.770
simply because this was
a high profile film.

00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:21.760
And a lot of people had issues
with some of the elements

00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:23.790
that weren't really issues.

00:52:23.790 --> 00:52:26.830
So I'm perfectly fine
with saying what was wrong

00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:28.080
if it's something I worked on.

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:32.780
But a lot of things, a lot
of complaints weren't wrong.

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:34.980
AUDIENCE: Well, on that
note, I'd like to thank you.

00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:35.855
And I think we'd all
like to thank you

00:52:35.855 --> 00:52:36.990
for coming to Google today.

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:38.440
GIA MORA: Thank you so
much for joining us.

00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:38.980
Dr. Kevin Grazier.

00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:39.820
Thank you guys for coming out.

00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:40.736
Thanks, Livestreamers.

00:52:40.736 --> 00:52:42.570
KEVIN GRAZIER:
Thanks for coming.
