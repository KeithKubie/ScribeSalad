00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.820
Let's get started
with some problems.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:04.620
Let's see.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:19.806
First problem: what
is 15% of 40?

00:00:19.806 --> 00:00:22.610
The way I do percent problems
is I just convert the

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.630
percentage to a decimal and
then I multiply it times the

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.720
number that I'm trying to
get the percentage of.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.820
So 15% as a decimal is 0.15.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.360
You learned that from the
percent to decimal conversion

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.640
video, hopefully.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.550
And we just multiply
this times 40.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:47.990
So let's say 40 times 0.15.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.510
5 times 0 is 0.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.100
5 times 4 is 20.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.620
Put a 0 there.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.660
And then 1 times 0 is 0.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.266
1 times 4 is 4.

00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:02.720
And you get 6 0 0.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.490
Then you count the
decimal spots.

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:05.670
1, 2.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.740
No decimals up there,
so you go 1, 2 and you

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.230
put the decimal there.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:18.870
So 15% of 40 is equal to 0.15
times 40, which equals 6.00.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.480
Well, that's just the
same thing as 6.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.640
Let's do another problem.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.710
Hopefully, that didn't
confuse you too much.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.960
And I'm going to try to
confuse you this time just

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.050
in case you weren't properly
confused the last time.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:47.860
What is 0.2% of-- let me
think of a number-- of 7.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.060
So a lot of people's
inclinations would just

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.010
say, oh, 0.2%, that's
the same thing as 0.2.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.950
And if that was your
inclination you would be wrong.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.610
Because remember,
this isn't 0.2.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.290
This is 0.2%.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.760
So there's two ways of
thinking about this.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.350
You could say that this is
0.2/100, which is, if you

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.270
multiply the numerator and
denominator by 10, is the

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.830
same thing as 2/1,000.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.260
Or you can just do the
technique where you

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
move the decimal space
over 2 to the left.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.360
In which case, if you're
starting with 0.2 and you

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.620
move the decimal space 2
to the left, you go bam.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.300
Whoops!

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.090
Bam, bam.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.170
That's where the decimal goes.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.370
So it's 0.002.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.410
This is key.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.370
0.2% is the same
thing as 0.002.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.110
This can always trip you up and
I've made this careless mistake

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.890
all the time, so don't feel
bad if you ever do it.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.460
But just always pay careful
attention if you see a

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.050
decimal and a percentage
at the same time.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.400
So now that we've figured out
how to write this percentage

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.210
as a decimal we just have to
multiply it times the number

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.000
that we want to take
the percentage of.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:09.190
So we say 0.002 times 7.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.490
Well, this is pretty
straightforward.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.070
7 times 2 is 14.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.710
And how many total numbers do
we have or how many total

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.830
digits do we have behind
the decimal point?

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:20.240
Let's see.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.930
It's 1, 2, 3.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.600
So we need 1, 2, 3 digits
behind the decimal point.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:36.175
So 0.2% of 7 is equal to 0.014.

00:03:36.175 --> 00:03:38.200
And you're probably thinking,
boy, that's a really,

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.360
really small number.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.545
And it makes sense because
0.2%, if you want to

00:03:44.545 --> 00:03:46.860
think about it, that's
smaller than even 1%.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.585
So that's even
smaller than 1/100.

00:03:48.585 --> 00:03:52.450
And actually, if you think
about it, 0.2% is 1/500.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.760
And if you do the math,
1/500 of 7 will turn

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.190
out to be this number.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.500
And that's an important
thing to do.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.240
It's always good to do a
reality check because when

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.560
you're doing these decimal and
these percent problems, it's

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.280
very easy to kind of lose a
factor of 10 here or there.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.240
Or gain a factor of 10.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.620
So always do a reality check to
see if your answer makes sense.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.630
So now I'm going to
confuse you even further.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:27.940
What if I were to ask you
4 is 20% of what number?

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.730
So a lot of people's
reflex might just be,

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.850
oh, let me take 20%.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.360
It becomes 0.20.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.850
And multiply it times 4.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.570
And in that case, again,
you may be wrong.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.080
Because think about it.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.700
I'm not saying
what is 20% of 4?

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.560
I'm saying that 20%
of some number is 4.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.470
So now we're going to be doing
a little bit of algebra.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.090
I bet you didn't expect that
in the percent module.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.080
So let x equal the number.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:14.630
And this problem says that
20% of x is equal to 4.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.500
I think now it's in a form
that you might recognize.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.240
So how do we write
20% as a decimal?

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.970
Well, that's just 0.20 or 0.2.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.890
And we just multiply
it by x to get 4.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.080
So 20%, that's the
same thing as 0.2.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.450
It's the same thing as 0.20,
but that last trailing

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.720
0 doesn't mean much.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.160
0.2 times x is equal to 4.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.080
And now we have a level
one linear equation.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.670
I bet you didn't
expect to see that.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.540
So what do we do?

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.550
Well there's two
ways to view it.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.820
You can just divide both
sides of this equation

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.700
by the coefficient on x.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:54.010
So if you divide 0.2 here
and you divide by 0.2 here.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:59.460
So you get x is equal
to 4 divided by 0.2.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.350
So let's figure out what
4 divided by 0.2 is.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.120
I hope I have enough space.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:12.500
0.2 goes into 4-- I'm going
to put a decimal point here.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.300
And the way we do these
problems, we move the

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.310
decimal point here one
over to the right.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.520
So we just get a 2 and then we
can move the decimal point

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.420
here one over to the right.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.680
So this 0.2 goes into 4
the same number of times

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.012
that 2 goes into 40.

00:06:26.012 --> 00:06:27.530
And this is easy.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.670
2 goes into 40 how many times?

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.152
Well, 2 goes into 4 two
times and then 2 goes

00:06:32.152 --> 00:06:32.980
into 0, zero times.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.050
You could've done
that in your head.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.530
2 into 40 is twenty times.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.580
So 4 divided by 0.2 is 20.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.570
So the answer is
4 is 20% of 20.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.280
And does that make sense?

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.640
Well, there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.610
20% is exactly 1/5.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.810
And 4 times 5 is 20.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:56.810
That makes sense.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.430
If you're still not sure
we can check the problem.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.630
Let's take 20% of 20.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:12.880
So 20% of 20 is equal
to 0.2 times 20.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.182
And if you do the math
that also will equal 4.

00:07:16.182 --> 00:07:18.410
So you made sure you
got the right answer.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:19.490
Let's do another one like that.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.810
I'm picking numbers randomly.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:36.140
Let's say 3 is 9% of what?

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:52.320
Once again, let's let x equal
the number that 3 is 9% of.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.680
You didn't have to
write all that.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:08:00.980
Well, in that case we know that
0.09x-- 0.09, that's the same

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.430
thing as 9% of x--
is equal to 3.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:10.770
Or that x is equal to
3 divided by 0.09.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:15.440
Well, if we do the decimal
division, 0.09 goes into 3.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.290
Let's put a decimal point here.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.260
I don't know how many
0's I'm going to need.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.220
So if I move this decimal over
to the right twice, then I'll

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.980
move this decimal over
to the right twice.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.580
So 0.09 goes into 3 the
same number of times

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.960
that 9 goes into 300.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.070
So 9 goes into 30 three times.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.820
3 times nine is 27.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.050
I think I see a
pattern here already.

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:41.310
30, 3, 3 times 9 is 27.

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:45.010
You're going to keep getting
33-- the 3's are just

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:46.490
going to go on forever.

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:50.960
So it turns out that 3 is 9%
of-- you can either write it as

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:58.870
33.3 repeating or we all know
that 0.3 forever is the

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.310
same thing as 1/3.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:05.380
So 3 is 9% of 33 and 1/3.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.220
Either one of those would
be an acceptable answer.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.700
And a lot of times when you're
doing percentages you're

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.885
actually just trying
to get a ballpark.

00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:15.790
The precision might not always
be the most important thing,

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:18.060
but in this case we
will be precise.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.390
And obviously, on tests
and things you need to

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:20.940
be precise as well.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.020
Hopefully, I didn't go too
fast and you have a good

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.340
sense of percentage.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.770
The important thing for these
type of problems is pay

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.740
attention to how the
problem is written.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.480
If it says find 10% of 100.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.050
That's easy.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:36.010
You just convert 10% to a
decimal and multiply it by 100.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.570
But if I were to ask you
100 is 10% of what?

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.340
You have to remember that
that's a different problem.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:45.440
In which case, 100 is 10% of--
and if you did the math,

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.850
it would be 1,000.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:50.730
I think I spoke very quickly on
this problem on this module, so

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:51.980
I hope you didn't
get too confused.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.440
But I will record more.
