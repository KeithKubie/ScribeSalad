00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.909
Hi I’m John Green and welcome to season
4 of CrashCourse literature.

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:08.950
Today, we’re transporting you to one of
my favorite (slash least favorite) dystopias,

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.950
George Orwell’s 1984.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.490
I feel like that eye is looking at me.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.320
The book starts like this:
It was a bright cold day in April and the

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.320
clocks were striking thirteen.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.520
Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast
in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.870
quickly through the glass doors of Victory
Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.150
a swirl of gritty dust from entering along
with him.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.190
(1)
Of course it’s not just a swirl of gritty

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.180
dust traveling with Winston; like everyone
in 1984, he’s never really alone.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.600
In Orwell’s dystopian future 1984, which
was published in 1949, the world is vile and

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.329
gritty and the clock strikes 13 and citizens
are under near constant government surveillance.

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.570
But you know what?

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.310
Orwell did not correctly predict the future;
our clocks still stop at 12.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.899
Also, in the novel 1984, people routinely
disappear and evidence of their existence

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.199
is erased from public records, and that doesn’t
happen much.

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.199
Yet.

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.600
1984 is an indictment of specific governments.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.720
But it’s also a warning about the importance
of free thought and speech, and in today’s

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.600
episode, we’re gonna discuss the historical
context in which 1984 was written and also

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.620
its use of oppressive language.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.770
I want to think about whether Orwell suggests,
within the logic of this novel, that the written

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.150
word can significantly alter the society in
which it is produced.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.020
And I mean that on at least two levels: Can
the novel 1984 change the actual world in

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.580
which we live, and are characters in the novel
ultimately controlled by the language they,

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.670
and their government, use?

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.270
Spoiler alert: We’re all doomed.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.270
I’m just kidding.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.930
I mean, I hope I’m kidding.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:53.640
The truth is, as usual, it’s complicated.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.530
INTRO
George Orwell’s protagonist, the wind-blown

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.710
Winston Smith, shares a first name with Winston
Churchill, the Prime Minister of the United

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.470
Kingdom from 1940-1945 and again from 1951-1955.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.550
And by replacing a lofty, aristocratic surname
(that evokes Churches.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.280
And Hills) with a common one (a Smith is a
metal worker), Orwell puts the fate of England

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.670
in the hands of a working man, although this
one bends words, not metal, since he is a

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.670
writer.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.950
As for whether Orwell’s Winston will prevail
as Winston Churchill did in World War II ...of

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.950
course not!

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.090
Now, some dystopias end with the overthrow
of the horrible government, but Orwell’s

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.730
tend to end with the bad guys and/or pigs
winning.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.220
And 1984 is very much a dystopia -- a dehumanizing
society in which “there seemed to be no

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.349
color in anything” and posters of a “black-mustachio’d
face gazing down from every commanding corner”

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.550
bearing the now-famous caption, “BIG BROTHER
IS WATCHING YOU” (2).

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.209
In this world, the government endorses something
called “doublethink,” which links contradictory

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.209
beliefs.

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.620
So you see slogans like: “WAR IS PEACE,”
“FREEDOM IS SLAVERY,” and “IGNORANCE

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.620
IS STRENGTH” are commonplace.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.870
The problem isn’t that citizens are told
the opposite of what is true.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.560
The real issue is that their experiences have
become so limited that they lack the perspective

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.510
and the language to differentiate between
major concepts.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.170
But, let’s back up for a second and talk
about George Orwell.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.170
Here’s some “doublespeak” for you: George
Orwell is not George Orwell.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.269
He was born Eric Arthur Blair in 1903 to English
parents in Bengal, near the border with Nepal.

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.489
His father worked in “quality control”
for opium, which is used to make morphine,

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.180
codeine, and heroin, and the British held
a monopoly on the trade of opium for years

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.750
and exported it to China, both for financial
gain and to subdue Chinese citizens.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.190
Although the Chinese government tried to get
the British to dismantle the India-China opium

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.290
trade for 150 years, and there were wars fought
about it, they weren’t successful until

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.290
1910.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.280
Basically, this was one of the largest (legal)
international drug cartels in history.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.690
Ah, Colonialism: The Original Dystopia.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.520
I guess the original dystopia was actually
hunting and gathering.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.849
I mean, at least for those of us who hate
the paleo diet.

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.830
God, I love processed carbohydrates.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:12.830
What were we talking about?

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:13.830
Oh, right!

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.200
Eric Arthur Blair, soon to be George Orwell!

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.789
So as a kid, Blair moved to England and was
eventually sent to Eton, a prestigious boarding

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:20.789
school.

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.759
In 1922, he joined the imperial police in
Burma.

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:27.919
In “Why I Write,” he explains that he
rejected imperialism after spending five years

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.639
in the “unsuitable profession” of working
in the imperial police force and experienced

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.219
poverty himself when he returned to England.

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:39.840
Sensitized to the evils of colonialism, and
now “fully aware of the existence of the

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.240
working classes,” Blair was on his way to
forming what he called a “political orientation.”

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.330
He changed his name to George Orwell when
he published Down and Out in Paris and London

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.650
in 1933.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.559
But he still hadn’t identified where he
“stood” politically.

00:04:54.559 --> 00:05:00.941
Then in 1936, he declared that he was
“against totalitarianism and for democratic

00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:03.369
socialism, as I understand it.”

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:08.240
Democratic socialism basically uses democratic
means to create a political and economic structure

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.360
that supports socialist goals.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:17.199
You might think of it as being a rejection
of unfettered capitalism.

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:22.220
Orwell found the “real nature of capitalist
society” abhorrent because:

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.580
“I have seen British imperialism at work
in Burma, and I have seen something of the

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.389
effects of poverty and unemployment in Britain….

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:35.490
One has got to be actively a Socialist, not
merely sympathetic to Socialism, or one plays

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.509
into the hands of our always-active enemies.”

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:44.419
Orwell was against Stalin and totalitarian
strains of Communism as well.

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.749
For instance, in 1936, when he went to Spain
to fight the Fascist leader, Francisco Franco,

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:51.279
he joined the Marxist group, POUM (Partido
Obrero de Unificación Marxista).

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:53.569
He didn’t join the main communist party.

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:57.800
In Homage to Catalonia, he explains:
“the Communists stood not upon the extreme

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.550
Left, but upon the extreme right.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.969
In reality this should come as no surprise,
because of the tactics of the Communist parties

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:05.969
elsewhere.”

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:10.539
These tactics, as seen in the USSR, include
the conscious use of propaganda, the repression

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:14.169
of individual freedoms, and also state-sponsored
murder.

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:18.600
But the point I want to make here is that
it’s not quite accurate for either the contemporary

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:24.409
left or right to “claim” Orwell--his most
famous novels are anti-communist; but they’re

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:25.409
also anti-capitalist.

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:30.690
Mostly, they seek to show the ways that many
government structures are prone to totalitarianism,

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:36.759
and they chart the slow, almost unnoticeable
descent into that totalitarianism.

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:41.569
But in 1984 specifically, Orwell explores
the difficulty of retaining individual freedom

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:44.379
within the confines of an oppressive society.

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:49.389
In the book, the earth is divided into three
zones--Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia--which

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:51.599
are constantly at war with one another.

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:56.300
And Winston lives in London, the main city
of Airstrip One, which is a province of Oceania.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.509
He’s legally married to the stiff, brainwashed,
and desireless Katherine.

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:05.319
Unable to produce children, they live separately
and are forbidden from remarrying.

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:09.770
Winson’s primary pleasures include itching
a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, drinking

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:14.499
shots of a “sickly, oily” Victory Gin
(which provides “the sensation of being

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:19.659
hit on the back of the head with a rubber
club”) and writing in a “thick, quarto-sized

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:22.460
blank book with a red back and a marbled cover”
(1, 5, 5).

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.889
So you know, his pleasures are scant.

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:29.759
Any life where one of the chief pleasures
is scratching an actual, literal itch, is

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:31.589
not, like, a great life.

00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:35.470
I mean, it’s a good life for a dog, but
not a great life for a person.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:40.610
Then Winston’s pleasures, and anxieties,
experience a significant uptick when he begins

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:45.089
an affair with the young, vital and beautiful
Julia.

00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:50.149
Despite being “ten or fifteen years younger,”
Julia boldly declares her love for Winston.

00:07:50.149 --> 00:07:53.800
Winston is incredulous: “I’m thirty-nine
years old.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.679
I’ve got a wife that I can’t get rid of.

00:07:55.679 --> 00:07:56.960
I’ve got varicose veins.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.869
I’ve got five false teeth.”

00:07:58.869 --> 00:08:00.439
And the reader may have doubts as well.

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:04.379
I mean, when Julia replies, “I couldn’t
care less,” Orwell seems to acknowledge

00:08:04.379 --> 00:08:09.409
(but not apologize for) this particular breed
of middle-aged male fantasy.

00:08:09.409 --> 00:08:10.409
(122).

00:08:10.409 --> 00:08:12.009
But you know, it’s also a romance that serves
a plot.

00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:14.509
So, Winston and Julia meet secretly for months.

00:08:14.509 --> 00:08:19.469
They rent rooms from an antiques dealer named
Mr. Charrington in the plebian quarter of

00:08:19.469 --> 00:08:20.469
London.

00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:24.749
They confess their affair and anti-party beliefs
to O’Brien, a member of the Inner Party

00:08:24.749 --> 00:08:27.360
who seems to be sympathetic to their cause.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:32.320
And they begin reading a book that is allegedly
written by the underground resistance leader,

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.389
Emmanuel Goldstein.

00:08:33.389 --> 00:08:38.250
They know that they’ll be discovered, tortured,
and (very probably) executed.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:43.459
Their victories--and yes they have some--come
from small moments of consciousness, human

00:08:43.459 --> 00:08:45.639
connection, and personal freedom.

00:08:45.639 --> 00:08:47.290
And these moments are tiny.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:51.970
For Winston, some of these moments include:
procuring a pen with a real nib “simply

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:59.519
because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy
paper deserved to be written on” (7); succumbing

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:03.820
to the ”balminess of the April air” to
stroll through the “labyrinth of London”

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.190
(84);
Winston also purchases a glass paperweight

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.620
containing coral, and all of this leads to
a cool point:

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.699
despite the authoritarian nature of Ingsoc
(the perversion of socialism that dominates

00:09:13.699 --> 00:09:17.839
Oceania), moments of personal freedom like
these are commonplace.

00:09:17.839 --> 00:09:22.930
There’s even a word for them in Newspeak,
the new language that the government is developing:

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:26.959
“ownlife, it was called, meaning individualism
and eccentricity” (84).

00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:32.070
But of course, the line between experiencing
an “ownlife” and engaging in political

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.260
subversion is really thin.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:39.430
I mean, when Winston gives in to his “animal
instinct, the simple undifferentiated desire”

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:44.819
to have sex with Julia: “Their embrace had
been a battle, the climax a victory.

00:09:44.819 --> 00:09:47.680
It was a blow struck against the Party.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.709
It was a political act” (128-9).

00:09:49.709 --> 00:09:51.139
There’s no ambiguity there.

00:09:51.139 --> 00:09:55.520
Making your life yours, making your choices
yours, is political.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.129
And also, having your own thoughts is political.

00:09:58.129 --> 00:10:02.269
I mean, The Party doesn’t just suppress
subversion through surveillance, and arrest,

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:07.279
and torture, and execution, those oldies but
goodies from Totalitarianism for Dummies.

00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:12.579
In 1984, the government also suppresses individualism
by limiting language.

00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:17.190
Just four pages into the book, an asterisk
appears after the first mention of “Newspeak”:

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:21.300
This asterisk interrupts the narrative flow,
breaking any bond that the reader may be (or,

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.000
let’s be honest, may not be) forming with
Winston.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.880
And it entices the reader towards an appendix,
narrated by a scholar living long after Winston.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.430
The appendix explains that Newspeak had been
“devised to meet the ideological needs of

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:39.620
Ingsoc” (309) and that its vocabulary has
been designed: “to make speech, and especially

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:46.540
speech on any subject not ideologically neutral,
as nearly as possible independent of consciousness”

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.540
(319).

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:51.240
In other words, it’s meant newspeak seeks
to make it nearly impossible to express, and

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.030
maybe in turn maybe even to THINK, revolutionary
thoughts.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:11:00.949
Let’s go to the Thought-bubble:
Newspeak has three main categories of vocabulary:

00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:05.180
The A vocabulary contains blunt words for
daily functions, like eating, working, and

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.180
sleeping.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.519
These words don’t have multiple meanings.

00:11:08.519 --> 00:11:13.810
(The examples listed include “hit, run,
dog, tree, sugar, house, field”)

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:19.320
The B vocabulary contains compound words that
blend a noun and verb to express a limited

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.720
number of political or ideological concepts.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.879
Like, “Goodthink” means orthodoxy to party
policy.

00:11:25.879 --> 00:11:27.709
“Crimethink” is its opposite.

00:11:27.709 --> 00:11:30.759
And the C vocabulary is scientific and technical.

00:11:30.759 --> 00:11:35.029
It contains jargon accessible only to workers
in a particular field.

00:11:35.029 --> 00:11:40.190
The idea is that no individual will be able
to synthesize knowledge from multiple fields.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:44.230
So people will be able to do their work, but
not be able to understand the context in which

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:45.560
that work is happening.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:49.390
And that’s one example of how, by trying
to limit what people can say, the government

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:52.209
is hoping to constrain what they can think.

00:11:52.209 --> 00:12:00.939
And an interesting feature of the Appendix
is that it explains th contained many superfluous

00:12:00.939 --> 00:12:05.360
words and archaic formulations which were
due to be suppressed later” (309).

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.189
This foreshadows that language will become
increasingly oppressive…

00:12:08.189 --> 00:12:11.470
Which, of course, is bad news for Winston
and his peers.

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.259
But there is some good news for the rest of
humanity.

00:12:14.259 --> 00:12:17.949
Because you will notice that the appendix
is written in Standard English.

00:12:17.949 --> 00:12:22.030
As many readers (including Thomas Pynchon
and Margaret Atwood) have pointed out, this

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:27.939
suggests that free thought and its expression
will ultimately prevail, and that language

00:12:27.939 --> 00:12:32.639
will once again be rich and complex and free.

00:12:32.639 --> 00:12:33.639
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:12:33.639 --> 00:12:35.540
So how do we get back to free language?

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:39.529
Well I’m a writer, and as such I’m almost
professionally obligated to believe in the

00:12:39.529 --> 00:12:43.500
power of language--and next week we’ll go
into more detail about the complicated relationship

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:47.430
between thoughts and language, but I think
it’s worth mentioning now that while we

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:53.579
don’t think entirely in words, language
does help give form and expression to complex

00:12:53.579 --> 00:12:54.579
ideas within us.

00:12:54.579 --> 00:12:57.150
I mean, that’s part of what books attempt
to do, but it’s also something we’re all

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:00.649
doing all day, because we think in language.

00:13:00.649 --> 00:13:04.519
It’s one of the primary ways we communicate
our feelings and experiences to other people,

00:13:04.519 --> 00:13:08.270
but it’s also one of the primary ways we
communicate that stuff within us.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:13.390
And I think in 1984 Orwell argues that the
restriction of language is ultimately a form

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.170
of restricting thought itself.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:20.579
It’s encouraging that Newspeak may ultimately
fail, but it does make me wonder: what thoughts

00:13:20.579 --> 00:13:23.379
can’t I think because of the language that
I’ve inherited?

00:13:23.379 --> 00:13:27.079
Next time we’ll also address a question
that should be on your mind (since you’re

00:13:27.079 --> 00:13:31.649
watching this video on something very like
a telescreen, possibly while in a government-funded

00:13:31.649 --> 00:13:35.569
school where the government is deciding at
least in part what you learn about):

00:13:35.569 --> 00:13:40.180
What can 1984 teach us about our current political
context and our relationship to what many

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.050
have called “surveillance” society?

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:47.629
And in a world where so many of us volunteer
so much of ourselves to the public sphere,

00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:49.850
is there value in private life?

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.550
Spoiler alert: I think so.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:14:03.240
But we’ll talk more about that next week.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:10.189
Thanks for watching.

00:14:10.189 --> 00:14:16.359
I’ll see you then.
